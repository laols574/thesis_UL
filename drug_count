The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that

The Mexican drug cartels have a lot of money and they know how to invest it to maximize their illegal profits. During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.  Is it possible that cartel money is now being used to change public opinion and the politicians opinions on the construction of the border wall between Mexico and the United States? I am just wondering now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

"There are too many innocent people being murdered every day and if you look at it long and hard you can see that it all is happening because there is no border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.  Weather it is from their drugs laced with fentanyl or weapons they brought with them or illegal immigrants who think the laws do not exist or pertain to them.  Build the wall and make them come through legally and catch the drugs and weapons at the port of entry!  We can't take care of our own.  Why are we still taking care of them.  The money it takes to build the wall will be cheaper in the long run from the money we save from Narcon used to save drug attics

Five dead in Illinois by gun violence. Far more deaths each year by gun violence and drug abuse. But sure.... let‚Äôs pretend a wall will solve it all.

We are spending so much money on illegal immigrants that a wall may not be such a bad idea at first I was pretty much against it but all the drugs are killing g so many people not to mention these immigrants get everything for free using taxpayers dollars yes maybe the money should be spent to help drug addiction or homeless or vets maybe we should have stricter laws for immigrants coming into this country I don‚Äôt know if the wall will help but something has to give.  This country was built on immigrants only native Americans are Native American Indians but if u want to come to this country you should have to take the proper steps and come legally. My parents were legal immigrants and they never took any money from the government for help.  I‚Äôm hoping that Trump is right and wall will help I just pray for unity and peace in our country

Does anyone not think that the Democrats are corrupt and making money from groups that profit from the illegal immigrants and drug smuggling coming across the border?

"This ""#Fakecrisis"" started back during the Eisenhower administration folks.. Deportations happened then when it was found to be a problem on our borders. Operation Wetback. Look it up. It's been a crisis ever since.. Since then we've had an issue with illegal immigration and its been getting worse every year. President Donald J. Trump is the only one besides Eisenhower who has had the gonads to do something about it. But.. All of a sudden it's called a ""fabricated crisis"". Most of congress.. Democrats AND Republicans are being paid off by various organizations to stop the border wall.. Albeit drug cartels

Speaker Pelosi how much money are the drug cartels paying you for NOT putting up a wall?

Good Afternoon you lying narcissistic moron. Your wall would not prevent any deaths nor any drug shipments. You're lying to the American people again. I'm looking forward to your resignation.

"It will do nothing for drugs

Ron Gagnon so you're saying once the wall is built there be no more shootings no more deaths no more drugs in the United States. You're a fool and Trump is using scare tactics. There was just a murder yesterday no one has said one word about that that's because the guy was in the u.s. citizen he shot and killed five people and wounded five others

"i think it shoild be publicized in any venue that people know how drugs

"I guess it would be to much to ask Baby Killers to have sympathy for angel families and people who have died from drugs that have come across the border

Commie run Hollywood pushes drugs and substance abuse in their movies. They set out to destroy nation states from within.

Drugs are a choice that unfortunately many teens make...Innocent teens getting shot and killed in school is not a choice......Where is the national emergency?

Republicans are murdering exponentially more people by denying the affordable health care and drugs than people being killed by illegal aliens. I'm sure most killings by illegal aliens are domestic or murders of people they know. Illegals aren't running around shooting people for the hell of it. But stupid Trump followers believe what ever the orange toad tells them.

"Estefania Torres Restrepo so how does anyone accurately determine how many people or the amount of drugs have came into the US undetected?  That's right

Estefania Torres Restrepo A Wall will keep out hundreds of illegals. Then more attention can be given at legal ports of entry to stop drugs flowing into the country. More people could be after the over stayed visa people.

Austin Baker he‚Äôs using the death to push for his border wall which he INCLUDES in the headline.   EXCEPT a wall will do nothing for illegal immigration. They overstay their visas or come in with forged documents. The ACTUAL drugs and crime come through vehicles through legal ports of entry.

Of course we care. But some of us seem better informed and know that fentanyl is flying in from China and that most drugs are intercepted at legal entry points. Trump is lying.

How do drugs get into prison if they have walls?

"Has Trump even mentioned the shooting this week of 5 people by Another American  who should not have had a gun. Nothing to do with the southern boarder again.  This post is one immigrant story which is now very old. Add up the amount of Americans our own Americans have killed in mass shootings!The emergency is new gun laws!!! And as for drugs

I support wall 100% for drugs dillers

Stopping drugs at our ports and better tracking expired visas works better. Get El Chapo (Great Idea Ted Cruz) to pay for the wall and put that money into port security and visa tracking. Most bang for the buck.

BUILD A WALL.  IN NEW MEXICO TOO AS WE ARE DESPERATE TO STOP DRUGS AND VIOLENCE

Obviously a big percentage of our Americans WANT the drugs! You really think the drug addicts in American won‚Äôt find other ways or do worse stuff to get it here! How can anyone think trump is doing ‚Äúright‚Äù he‚Äôs WRONG! We‚Äôve never had so many bad things happen like we do since he‚Äôs been president!! #ImpeachTrump use the ‚Äúwall funding‚Äù for children with cancer or homeless/jobless people. Fucking bullshit!!

Yes people we have several problems in this country mass shootings drugs illegal aliens and so on so forth.  We now have a president who is picking a problem and doing something about it.  Then we can move on to the next thing.   It may not be the fix all but even if it only keeps out half the drugs and illegal's that's a huge victory. Build to wall.

"I submit that things consistently being uncontrollable at the border for so many years proves that the only way to actually gain control over it IS to declare it a national emergency. It's clear just trying to legislate activity hasn't done anything substantial.  If alcohol is negatively impacting your liver and you continue to drink doesn't that call for stronger measures against drinking? So a doctor informs you to stop or you'll die. Yet you continue to imbibe alcohol. At what point does that become considered a health emergency? Or do you just keep hearing that you have to stop or you'll die until that actually becomes the reality. By then it's to late to respond with corrective action. ...in this case America is the ""body"" and drugs are killing the body. Over the years it's only getting worse. They say they will stop it with legislation but never really stop it. The addict is going to allow themselves to die and the members of the body are sort of not wanting to let that happen.

Not only complete it but install laws to prevent future issues and weedi g out the ones here uding and selling drugs. Guns. Or people.

Gregory Baxter More people die from illegal and prescription drugs and medical mistakes than guns in this country. You people really need to get off gun BS cause guess what Guns aren‚Äôt going any where. They are in our Constitution. Illegal immigration is NOT.

"Donald J. Trump so my question to you Mr. President is why so much concentration on our southern border . I understand yes drugs do come from there but also what about by planes 

Jackie Lee Collins More People die from drugs than guns. Stop with the gun comparisons.

People don‚Äôt realize that these people coming here the wrong way could be criminals. Also they try to bring drugs over in turn kill our loved ones.

Democraps love the flow of drugs coming in this country more than anyone's life.  The President has to take it in his own hands to do something.

No.  Fear mongering is wrong. Smart border security like walls and fencing and technology.  The  majority of illegal immigration and drugs come through ports of entry..

Alejandro Sanchez DRUGS! Not just the people.

Amen thanks Trump for protecting us getting bad drugs out

whoever denies that wall will work is an idiot with an agenda in collution with the drugs cartel of Mexico

"Jo Sechi Drugs kill more people than gun related deaths

Angela K Christensen.   Anybody who raises their hand would be foolish. We all know they came in by plane. A better question is raise your hand if you think the current wall is the reason all the Fentanyl was confiscated 2 weeks ago. Enough to kill 57000 people. That is the better question. Obviously those drugs wouldn't be coming into a port of entry if there was no wall. They would have come over in backpacks at points of the border where there isn't enough security.

Tony Connelly how many die from drug OD from drugs smuggled across the southern border?

"It's not just about drugs and murders. It's about the fact people are coming in illegally. What is so hard to grasp about the word ""ILLEGAL?"""

What a crock. Trump said himself he didn‚Äôt need to call a national emergency he just did it to attempt to sidestep congress.   Illegal immigrants are less likely to kill than native born Americans.  Drugs come in mainly through regular ports of entry. Illegal crossings are at an all time low. But hey who needs facts and rule of law when living in trumps Orwellian universe full of alternative facts.

They have killed more with all the deadly drugs they bring in . Yes their not all bad but with the wall it will stop the madness . Trump is trying to make America safe again democrats are stopping it .  It‚Äôs very simple it wasnt very long ago with Obama     the Democrats wanted a wall to stop the illegals but now they are resisting because if trumps succeeds in getting a wall up and making America safe the Democrats will be on a sinking ship with a giant hole in the middle of it. The old schoolers need to look and see the  Democrat party they once believed in is long gone .  But they are lied to telling them Trump will take away Social Security and Medicare.  It‚Äôs a lie . Trump said you earned it . God Bless America and let‚Äôs come together as one .

"We only know what we catch coming in which is a fraction of all the drugs

I'm sorry for the loss of life due to illegal aliens but how many death from homegrown players deaths from no insurance or drugs to save them America is broke and istead of fixing it we are building a wall

When I ask my self this question. About the wall. And weight out all the pros and cons. I came up with this.  I had a daughter. That was involved in. Human trafficking. She did not even know she was doing it. Because of the drugs and the influence. It had on her. She call us. And wanted to come home for a few days. I knew she was a prostitute. And it was hard to just think that some day I‚Äôm going to get a phone call. From the police. Saying your daughter is dead. In my heart. Was a broken heart. To think what she was doing. She was MIA. Then out of the blue she called. I asked her questions. How are you. When are you going to come home. She would not say nothing. Out of shame. I would begin to cry. She would say dad don‚Äôt cry. This is my choice. So I asked her this. What are you doing right now.  She told me. She was at the bus stop. To pick up some girls. From New York. I asked why. Because her pimp wanted her to. I told her. That is human trafficking. She said what‚Äôs that. And I told her. What human trafficking is. And what happens to girls. She took the girls to a safe house. And she had to stay with them until the pimps. Muscle guys. Came and took him away. She told me they were 12 to 15-year-olds. She never saw those girls again after that night when the muscleman came and took them.  If a wall just stops one of these acts and prevent someone from getting killed from drugs to me it‚Äôs worth having the wall. If they can‚Äôt come to America legally then they should not come at all does it read those their grandparents or someone they know that wanted to come to America had to either come here legally or illegally. Lives matters. And walls will save lives.

Walls don't work. If they want to deal drugs or do harm their going to find a way to do it.  That's why their called criminals.

If families or mothers are called angel families & angel mothers of those killed by illegal aliens. What are the parents/families/mothers of those killed by American citizens referred to as? If ICE & Border patrol would do their jobs & if American citizens would stop using drugs & if companies would stop hiring illegals (like Trump) we wouldn‚Äôt have a problem. Five year olds killed at Sandy Hook & Vegas concert massacre & Parkland. What are these families called? SOL???

All the democrats want to do is hesitate hasitate on doing anything to protect southern border from illegals an drugs But you know that they know its coming across an don't give a damn about stopping it.

Illegal drugs killed my beautiful young grandson. One of 135 that day. Why would you resist a President that wants to spare us from all this? Pray it is never your child Liberal.

"It is awfully naive to think a wall along our southern border will stop people and drugs from coming into our country.  The northern border is much longer.  Our coastlines ate much longer.  Tunnels go under walls. Ladders and drones

Beth Ritchason those people have a right to be here. We don't need to import more criminals! DRUGS poor over that boarder and Americans die.

Sad that so many have lost their lives. I pray that all illegals are removed before any more of our children are murdered & addicts get help before they are killed by these drugs flowing into our country. God Bless President Trump for taking the necessary steps when our traitor congress would not.

"Keep it up mr president! The right Choices aren't always popular! Your protecting us from drugs

I support you 100% get the drugs off the streets ! Yes crime rate is going up for the Americans because drug dealers are getting it into their hands and they are going crazy and committing crime. We need more focus on mental health as well .

Reading thru these comments i can very well see why this country is in the shape its in .heres a man trying to make this country better and theres people on here acting like spoiled kids that refuse to admit hes doing a good job .its not just about killing or drugs or rape or draining our benefits programs .putting our hospitals in financial problems .drunk driving or even working and sending the money back to mexico and other places its all these and more .money that could help seniors .vets kids .drug addicts .single parents and to try and fix our health ins issues are going for  these illegals .not to mention so called border security. Do you people think they all go to points of entry to come in ?do you know how many miles are open for them to come in .stop and think people .some of you act like you know more about what goes on then people that work and deal with it every day .unless you know for fact dont try to act like it is .all of this dident just start been going on for years .Trump is the first one to care enough to try to stop it .and all the other issues you are bringing up give the man time .hes trying hes not only fighting the stupid democrats hes fighting fools like the ones on here

After living near the border and knowing people who worked for border patrol it would be wiser to bring the military home and put them on the border and get rid of the bad border patrol  !  He would win on two fronts bringing military home and saving money because they are home and can be near families and it would be better then the wall.  They should sell all majuana  to place selling it legally to raise money for wall and anyone bringing hard drugs should face a firing squad that will stop drugs and he would be re-elected.

This post is one immigrant story which is now very old. Add up the amount of Americans our own Americans have killed in mass shootings!The emergency is new gun laws!!! And as for drugs

I support wall 100% for drugs dillers

Stopping drugs at our ports and better tracking expired visas works better. Get El Chapo (Great Idea Ted Cruz) to pay for the wall and put that money into port security and visa tracking. Most bang for the buck.

BUILD A WALL.  IN NEW MEXICO TOO AS WE ARE DESPERATE TO STOP DRUGS AND VIOLENCE

Obviously a big percentage of our Americans WANT the drugs! You really think the drug addicts in American won‚Äôt find other ways or do worse stuff to get it here! How can anyone think trump is doing ‚Äúright‚Äù he‚Äôs WRONG! We‚Äôve never had so many bad things happen like we do since he‚Äôs been president!! #ImpeachTrump use the ‚Äúwall funding‚Äù for children with cancer or homeless/jobless people. Fucking bullshit!!

Yes people we have several problems in this country mass shootings drugs illegal aliens and so on so forth.  We now have a president who is picking a problem and doing something about it.  Then we can move on to the next thing.   It may not be the fix all but even if it only keeps out half the drugs and illegal's that's a huge victory. Build to wall.

"Jo Sechi Drugs kill more people than gun related deaths

Angela K Christensen.   Anybody who raises their hand would be foolish. We all know they came in by plane. A better question is raise your hand if you think the current wall is the reason all the Fentanyl was confiscated 2 weeks ago. Enough to kill 57000 people. That is the better question. Obviously those drugs wouldn't be coming into a port of entry if there was no wall. They would have come over in backpacks at points of the border where there isn't enough security.

Tony Connelly how many die from drug OD from drugs smuggled across the southern border?

"It's not just about drugs and murders. It's about the fact people are coming in illegally. What is so hard to grasp about the word ""ILLEGAL?"""

What a crock. Trump said himself he didn‚Äôt need to call a national emergency he just did it to attempt to sidestep congress.   Illegal immigrants are less likely to kill than native born Americans.  Drugs come in mainly through regular ports of entry. Illegal crossings are at an all time low. But hey who needs facts and rule of law when living in trumps Orwellian universe full of alternative facts.

They have killed more with all the deadly drugs they bring in . Yes their not all bad but with the wall it will stop the madness . Trump is trying to make America safe again democrats are stopping it .  It‚Äôs very simple it wasnt very long ago with Obama     the Democrats wanted a wall to stop the illegals but now they are resisting because if trumps succeeds in getting a wall up and making America safe the Democrats will be on a sinking ship with a giant hole in the middle of it. The old schoolers need to look and see the  Democrat party they once believed in is long gone .  But they are lied to telling them Trump will take away Social Security and Medicare.  It‚Äôs a lie . Trump said you earned it . God Bless America and let‚Äôs come together as one .

We are spending so much money on illegal immigrants that a wall may not be such a bad idea at first I was pretty much against it but all the drugs are killing g so many people not to mention these immigrants get everything for free using taxpayers dollars yes maybe the money should be spent to help drug addiction or homeless or vets maybe we should have stricter laws for immigrants coming into this country I don‚Äôt know if the wall will help but something has to give.  This country was built on immigrants only native Americans are Native American Indians but if u want to come to this country you should have to take the proper steps and come legally. My parents were legal immigrants and they never took any money from the government for help.  I‚Äôm hoping that Trump is right and wall will help I just pray for unity and peace in our country

"We only know what we catch coming in which is a fraction of all the drugs

I'm sorry for the loss of life due to illegal aliens but how many death from homegrown players deaths from no insurance or drugs to save them America is broke and istead of fixing it we are building a wall

When I ask my self this question. About the wall. And weight out all the pros and cons. I came up with this.  I had a daughter. That was involved in. Human trafficking. She did not even know she was doing it. Because of the drugs and the influence. It had on her. She call us. And wanted to come home for a few days. I knew she was a prostitute. And it was hard to just think that some day I‚Äôm going to get a phone call. From the police. Saying your daughter is dead. In my heart. Was a broken heart. To think what she was doing. She was MIA. Then out of the blue she called. I asked her questions. How are you. When are you going to come home. She would not say nothing. Out of shame. I would begin to cry. She would say dad don‚Äôt cry. This is my choice. So I asked her this. What are you doing right now.  She told me. She was at the bus stop. To pick up some girls. From New York. I asked why. Because her pimp wanted her to. I told her. That is human trafficking. She said what‚Äôs that. And I told her. What human trafficking is. And what happens to girls. She took the girls to a safe house. And she had to stay with them until the pimps. Muscle guys. Came and took him away. She told me they were 12 to 15-year-olds. She never saw those girls again after that night when the muscleman came and took them.  If a wall just stops one of these acts and prevent someone from getting killed from drugs to me it‚Äôs worth having the wall. If they can‚Äôt come to America legally then they should not come at all does it read those their grandparents or someone they know that wanted to come to America had to either come here legally or illegally. Lives matters. And walls will save lives.

Walls don't work. If they want to deal drugs or do harm their going to find a way to do it.  That's why their called criminals.

"It will do nothing for drugs

Ron Gagnon so you're saying once the wall is built there be no more shootings no more deaths no more drugs in the United States. You're a fool and Trump is using scare tactics. There was just a murder yesterday no one has said one word about that that's because the guy was in the u.s. citizen he shot and killed five people and wounded five others

"i think it shoild be publicized in any venue that people know how drugs

"I guess it would be to much to ask Baby Killers to have sympathy for angel families and people who have died from drugs that have come across the border

Commie run Hollywood pushes drugs and substance abuse in their movies. They set out to destroy nation states from within.

Drugs are a choice that unfortunately many teens make...Innocent teens getting shot and killed in school is not a choice......Where is the national emergency?

David Monson 90 percent of drugs coming in from Mexico.

It's alright when they wanted to do it an all agreed but it's just because Trump is not a life long politician they don't want him to do it an look like a hero after it stops all the drugs an massive crime from pouring into our country it's a fucking joke

"I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels‚Äô hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy‚Äôs and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives

Charlesetta Brown r u crazy one crime ? Open yoyr eyes . There is crime by the hour from these illegals. Not to mention these drugs are kids are getting from them. You people need to wake up

Cal Phillips  soo..... u blaming immigrants for selling ur kid drugs that he bought with his money and his decision hmmm in that care i got 6 friends that are white and sell cocain heroin weed flaka acid xanax  and one of my friends is hispanic and died because of one of them how bout give the land you guys took stingy ass crackers

Republicans are murdering exponentially more people by denying the affordable health care and drugs than people being killed by illegal aliens. I'm sure most killings by illegal aliens are domestic or murders of people they know. Illegals aren't running around shooting people for the hell of it. But stupid Trump followers believe what ever the orange toad tells them.

"Estefania Torres Restrepo so how does anyone accurately determine how many people or the amount of drugs have came into the US undetected?  That's right

Estefania Torres Restrepo A Wall will keep out hundreds of illegals. Then more attention can be given at legal ports of entry to stop drugs flowing into the country. More people could be after the over stayed visa people.

Austin Baker he‚Äôs using the death to push for his border wall which he INCLUDES in the headline.   EXCEPT a wall will do nothing for illegal immigration. They overstay their visas or come in with forged documents. The ACTUAL drugs and crime come through vehicles through legal ports of entry.   He‚Äôs not asking you to pay for immigration suppression but an entire waste of money that‚Äôs more symbolic of America than it is an effective tools

"Angela K Christensen You can‚Äôt have national security without border security. It‚Äôs not only necessary for any meaningful immigration reform; border security plays a crucial role in both the interdiction of illegal drugs and in defending America against criminal threats. Weak borders allow criminal and smugglers

Mike V. Radatti more Americans are killed by fellow Americans with guns than anything else including drugs from over the Mexican border and illegals put together

Walls work that's why there is no drugs and weapons in prison

"There are too many innocent people being murdered every day and if you look at it long and hard you can see that it all is happening because there is no border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.  Weather it is from their drugs laced with fentanyl or weapons they brought with them or illegal immigrants who think the laws do not exist or pertain to them.  Build the wall and make them come through legally and catch the drugs and weapons at the port of entry!  We can't take care of our own.  Why are we still taking care of them.  The money it takes to build the wall will be cheaper in the long run from the money we save from Narcon used to save drug attics

Justin Fox so we don‚Äôt need a wall   Feds bring drugs into this country too ü§´

Deanette Christopherson Yea I‚Äôm aware. But a wall would be a physical tariff. It would regulate the amount of drugs as well I

It's a shame you have to do all this for something that  as everyone can see is wrong do they not see the gangs in California or the pictures of the drugs that's caught at the border not just because you in office you the one trying to fix this...it's crazy they want it to stay the same....Do Americans care about America?

Of course we care. But some of us seem better informed and know that fentanyl is flying in from China and that most drugs are intercepted at legal entry points. Trump is lying.

It‚Äôs very simple it wasnt very long ago with Obama     the Democrats wanted a wall to stop the illegals but now they are resisting because if trumps succeeds in getting a wall up and making America safe the Democrats will be on a sinking ship with a giant hole in the middle of it. The old schoolers need to look and see the  Democrat party they once believed in is long gone .  But they are lied to telling them Trump will take away Social Security and Medicare.  It‚Äôs a lie . Trump said you earned it . God Bless America and let‚Äôs come together as one .

We are spending so much money on illegal immigrants that a wall may not be such a bad idea at first I was pretty much against it but all the drugs are killing g so many people not to mention these immigrants get everything for free using taxpayers dollars yes maybe the money should be spent to help drug addiction or homeless or vets maybe we should have stricter laws for immigrants coming into this country I don‚Äôt know if the wall will help but something has to give.  This country was built on immigrants only native Americans are Native American Indians but if u want to come to this country you should have to take the proper steps and come legally. My parents were legal immigrants and they never took any money from the government for help.  I‚Äôm hoping that Trump is right and wall will help I just pray for unity and peace in our country

"We only know what we catch coming in which is a fraction of all the drugs

I'm sorry for the loss of life due to illegal aliens but how many death from homegrown players deaths from no insurance or drugs to save them America is broke and istead of fixing it we are building a wall

When I ask my self this question. About the wall. And weight out all the pros and cons. I came up with this.  I had a daughter. That was involved in. Human trafficking. She did not even know she was doing it. Because of the drugs and the influence. It had on her. She call us. And wanted to come home for a few days. I knew she was a prostitute. And it was hard to just think that some day I‚Äôm going to get a phone call. From the police. Saying your daughter is dead. In my heart. Was a broken heart. To think what she was doing. She was MIA. Then out of the blue she called. I asked her questions. How are you. When are you going to come home. She would not say nothing. Out of shame. I would begin to cry. She would say dad don‚Äôt cry. This is my choice. So I asked her this. What are you doing right now.  She told me. She was at the bus stop. To pick up some girls. From New York. I asked why. Because her pimp wanted her to. I told her. That is human trafficking. She said what‚Äôs that. And I told her. What human trafficking is. And what happens to girls. She took the girls to a safe house. And she had to stay with them until the pimps. Muscle guys. Came and took him away. She told me they were 12 to 15-year-olds. She never saw those girls again after that night when the muscleman came and took them.  If a wall just stops one of these acts and prevent someone from getting killed from drugs to me it‚Äôs worth having the wall. If they can‚Äôt come to America legally then they should not come at all does it read those their grandparents or someone they know that wanted to come to America had to either come here legally or illegally. Lives matters. And walls will save lives.

Walls don't work. If they want to deal drugs or do harm their going to find a way to do it.  That's why their called criminals.

If families or mothers are called angel families & angel mothers of those killed by illegal aliens. What are the parents/families/mothers of those killed by American citizens referred to as? If ICE & Border patrol would do their jobs & if American citizens would stop using drugs & if companies would stop hiring illegals (like Trump) we wouldn‚Äôt have a problem. Five year olds killed at Sandy Hook & Vegas concert massacre & Parkland. What are these families called? SOL???

"Ina Maitland no the wall is not wrong . We have children dying every few minutes from drugs brought in why cant you people open your eyes. Most people have wall and fences around there home for safety . What in the

How about the drugs that are made here in the United states that are killing people

All the democrats want to do is hesitate hasitate on doing anything to protect southern border from illegals an drugs But you know that they know its coming across an don't give a damn about stopping it.

Illegal drugs killed my beautiful young grandson. One of 135 that day. Why would you resist a President that wants to spare us from all this? Pray it is never your child Liberal.

"It is awfully naive to think a wall along our southern border will stop people and drugs from coming into our country.  The northern border is much longer.  Our coastlines ate much longer.  Tunnels go under walls. Ladders and drones

Beth Ritchason those people have a right to be here. We don't need to import more criminals! DRUGS poor over that boarder and Americans die.

It was the largest cocaine bust in 25 years at California's Port Hueneme.  More than 200 pounds of cocaine were found hidden on two ships.  The feds announced the bust on the same day Donald Trump said drugs don't come through ports of entry.

"My 18 year brother was killed by an illegal immigrant in 2005 who was high on drugs and drunk

Walls don't work......they just start digging using fake documents or boats wall is waste of money simple maths says war on drugs has never been won probably never will

President Donald J. Trump thank you for trying to save America from the drugs and the invasion. as a life time Democrat i salute you for fighting for us

"Too many lives lost at the hands of Illegals! From drugs

Behind you 100 % illegal. immigrants need to come in the right way . Democrats need to wake up on this issue. And the drugs that are comming in.

Sad that so many have lost their lives. I pray that all illegals are removed before any more of our children are murdered & addicts get help before they are killed by these drugs flowing into our country. God Bless President Trump for taking the necessary steps when our traitor congress would not.

"Keep it up mr president! The right Choices aren't always popular! Your protecting us from drugs

I support you 100% get the drugs off the streets ! Yes crime rate is going up for the Americans because drug dealers are getting it into their hands and they are going crazy and committing crime. We need more focus on mental health as well .

Reading thru these comments i can very well see why this country is in the shape its in .heres a man trying to make this country better and theres people on here acting like spoiled kids that refuse to admit hes doing a good job .its not just about killing or drugs or rape or draining our benefits programs .putting our hospitals in financial problems .drunk driving or even working and sending the money back to mexico and other places its all these and more .money that could help seniors .vets kids .drug addicts .single parents and to try and fix our health ins issues are going for  these illegals .not to mention so called border security. Do you people think they all go to points of entry to come in ?do you know how many miles are open for them to come in .stop and think people .some of you act like you know more about what goes on then people that work and deal with it every day .unless you know for fact dont try to act like it is .all of this dident just start been going on for years .Trump is the first one to care enough to try to stop it .and all the other issues you are bringing up give the man time .hes trying hes not only fighting the stupid democrats hes fighting fools like the ones on here

After living near the border and knowing people who worked for border patrol it would be wiser to bring the military home and put them on the border and get rid of the bad border patrol  !  He would win on two fronts bringing military home and saving money because they are home and can be near families and it would be better then the wall.  They should sell all majuana  to place selling it legally to raise money for wall and anyone bringing hard drugs should face a firing squad that will stop drugs and he would be re-elected.

Take the $14bil seized from El Chapo and build that wall!!! You can then bypass all of the crooked congress that want the drugs here-#winwin Donald J. Trump

"A wall will not stop drugs and illegals

Until Prisons are safe of Drugs and Crime then we should support a Wall.  A National Emergency should have been when School Kids were Slaughtered by White men with AR's.. Let that sink in Chump..

"I pray that all you folks that support these idiots that are fighting Trump on The Wall never have to feel the horror of losing a child or any family member to violence or drugs brought here by these illegals

We do not need the wall! If it‚Äôs drugs coming in your worried about? That‚Äôs our problem because that wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if Americans didn‚Äôt BUY the drugs. Illegal immigrants killing people? Yes it‚Äôs bad but Americans kill more Americans than illegals do. Why don‚Äôt we make it easier to become legal so that the people who are good people wanting a better life don‚Äôt have to wait 10-12 years to come in legally. Fix America and the other issues will be way easier to fix

You drive drunk - you get arrested- you sell drugs- you get arrested- you kill someone you get arrested- you shoplift- you get arrested- you trespass- you get arrested.  You come in to the US illegally/ you should either- A) get arrested  B get sent back  Why is that a problem?

The Mexican drug cartels have a lot of money and they know how to invest it to maximize their illegal profits. During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.  Is it possible that cartel money is now being used to change public opinion and the politicians opinions on the construction of the border wall between Mexico and the United States? I am just wondering now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
