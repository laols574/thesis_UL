The Native Americans were massacred and given smallpox and had their land taken away.  What about them.  As soon as you white people loose someone to any race but your own you want to act uo, save it.  You are no better than anybody else."

What most people want including people that live and work there is smart border security. That is what we need.

No wall has ever arrested, robbed, battered, or murdered nonviolent people, as immigration enforcement has. A wall will not create an interest group to lobby for itself, endorse nationalist presidential candidates, and demand more power and funding, as the Border Patrol union does. The wall is more than a symbol. It will harm the lives of thousands of border residents and immigrants while wasting billions of tax dollars.

There is an enormous amount of data available after decades of research, it‚Äôs all there you just have to look. These are based on STATISTICS and not opinion."
positive,Just like the demo leaders using shootings to further their gun grabbing bullshizz??
negative,David Woodsmall the difference is their using those events to push for reform that can actually save lives in the future. A border wall is ineffective in preventing these deaths
neutral,"""Could've been my son!"""
positive,Estefania Torres Restrepo The southern border might as well be considered a port of entry. Cause they sure as heck enter through it. We cant just have open desert between the two countries where people are free to roam back and forth.
neutral,Estefania Torres Restrepo A Wall will keep out hundreds of illegals. Then more attention can be given at legal ports of entry to stop drugs flowing into the country. More people could be after the over stayed visa people.
positive,Estefania Torres Restrepo political gainüôÑ how about safety....using the deaths to show a secure border is necessary!!!
negative,You're disgusting for not having normal compassion for a man who lost a child. Hatefulness is the new normal for liberals it appears.

negative,Estefania Torres Restrepo not if we get enough ice agents to round them up and throw them the hell out of here
negative,"Estefania Torres Restrepo California  LARGEST INSANE ASYLUM IN THE WORLD  Interesting that the LA Times did this. All the others are staying away from it. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this should be of great interest to you!  Just One State - be sure and read the last part...  try for 3 times.  This is only one State... If this doesn't open your eyes, nothing will!  From the LA. Times:  1. 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right)  2. 95 %of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.  3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.  4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.  5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.  6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.  7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.  8 Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.  9. 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking.  10. In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.  (All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times)  Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare.  Over 70% of the United States' annual population growth, ( and over 90% of California, Florida, and New York), results from immigration.  Also, 29% of inmates in federal prisons are illegal aliens.  We are fools for letting this continue.  HOW CAN YOU HELP?  Send copies of this letter, to at least two other people.  To 100, would be even better."
negative,"Estefania Torres Restrepo you aren't very bright are you. 94 percent of border agents, the head of the border union, the chief and 8 out of 10 border mayors all stated a wall helps. Please research before spewing ignorant rhetoric. Btw, I would be embarrassed if my heritage invaded a country where most don't speak English, have no skill, cost the American Tax Payers billions and wouldn't assimilate"
negative,"Interesting you talk about research because you haven‚Äôt posted a link to any article. Can you post a link to the article you received these statistics?  Here is an LA Times article posted Last week saying that there isn‚Äôt a crisis at the border.   https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trump-speech-immigration-border-crisis-20190206-story.html  Also I‚Äôm not sure how the history of the country I was born in should have any say in who I am as a person? What if I judged you on the history of America? Last I checked, white people today should have no burden placed on them for the atrocities of slavery in America. Let me know since that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been reading."
negative,I thought the same thing. Trump is disgusting. His supporters are sycophantic dogs.
negative,"Estefania Torres Restrepo look it up you moron. Look up what the border agents, the chief and mayors have said. I would be embarrassed if my heritage invaded a country where they committed crimes, most couldn't speak English, had no skill, didn't assimilate, didn't care about AMERICA and cost the American Tax Payers 130 billion a year"
negative,You are disgusting because her life means nothing to you. She and all the others who will be killed by someone who has NO right to be here are the reason we need a wall!! You actually have a higher chance of being affected by an illegal as you are part of the Latino community.
negative,Idiot
negative,Austin Baker he‚Äôs using the death to push for his border wall which he INCLUDES in the headline.   EXCEPT a wall will do nothing for illegal immigration. They overstay their visas or come in with forged documents. The ACTUAL drugs and crime come through vehicles through legal ports of entry.

negative,Valerie Siggson FAKE NEWS!
negative,Walls don‚Äôt bring dead people back maybe see if therapist instead or try thinking for yourself
negative,"Wondering why exactly?  I mean, since there was no national emergency then, either...but maybe you just meant to point out that if there had ever been one obviously the GOP would have had the trophy wall erected LONG ago, so it's blatantly clear there is no national emergency."
neutral,Art Jackson  Dear... The problem of immigrants before the elections before 2016... The problem is outdated... But at the beginning of 2017... Congress was Republican... The wall and its problems will not affect the 2020 elections... Like now... On the contrary it will be positive... and other things...
negative,Try taking a good look at the northern border.  No wall.  Other methods. Terrific security.  And they aren't working on stopping poor terrified people trying to get away from conflicts we are partly responsible for...they are trying to make sure nobody gets to us through them and pulls another 9/11.  This wall is a waste of money.
positive,"First of all, I have sympathy for these people trying to find a better life but the US cannot continue to take care of these people.  It is costing us billions of dollars monthly now.  Can you imagine the cost if we allow droves of them to come as these caravans from central America are coming?  Once you let some in, nearly all from those countries will be here.  We have our own needy to take care of and doing a somewhat shabby job of that.                                  How many are you willing to sponsor, Art?"
negative,"waiting 2 years to declare an emergency is hardly addressing an emergency if he waited until after he didnt get his own way to call it , he just needs to keep his base happy so he gets a second term"
positive,Waiting for congress to fund the act passed years before by the democrats to secure the border. Do you think he wants to take this to Supreme Court?
negative,Jim Russell cuz it is not an emergency
negative,"Angela K Christensen You can‚Äôt have national security without border security. It‚Äôs not only necessary for any meaningful immigration reform; border security plays a crucial role in both the interdiction of illegal drugs and in defending America against criminal threats. Weak borders allow criminal and smugglers, as well as millions of illegal aliens, to have virtually free entrance to the United States.  If this was not true then why are there some 20 million ILLEGAL aliens living in the United States now, and why is there a drug epidemic killing thousands of Americans every year, and why are Americans being robbed and murdered by Illegal aliens.  Contrary to news reports the majority of these drugs are traceable to drug cartels in Mexico, not from pharmaceutical companies."

positive,"James Ellis great response, keyboard warrior."
negative,Jordan Miller have you ever thought about the fact that the driver was drunk? He was obviously going very fast if he hit her that hard and some terrains make it hard to see when people are coming down the street. Shame on you for having absolutely no soul and saying it was her fault.
negative,"Alyssa Taylor he was drunk. But like I said this was a drunk idiot problem, and has nothing to do with Mexicans. Where‚Äôs all this outrage when a drunk Russian or Ukrainian who overstayed their visa hits and kills a person? Why are only Mexicans used in this way?? For political brownie points."
negative,Alyssa Taylor and I‚Äôm not saying whose fault it is. Does it really matter to the dead person whose fault it is? If I have the right of way at the intersection and someone hits me and kills me - I‚Äôm still just as dead. No matter whose fault it is.
negative,Jordan Miller wrong again. Had he not been here it would not have happened . Build the wall keep america safe. You people need to open yoyr eyes and take your rose colored glasses off. What a shame to see so many not wanting to pertect the american people. I am sure you and everyone elese has a fence or locks yoyr doors hey how bout shuts your doirs . Why do you have and do these things if walls dont work....
negative,You are a heartless human.  I hope you never have to feel the pain of losing a loved one. He made a bad decision to drink and drive. He shouldn't have been  here in the first place and of story. They may never get justice for their daughter and that's so sad.
negative,"Jordan Miller I think there is still outrage but personally I dont see or hear about as many Russians or Ukrainians walking or driving across the desert to illegally gain entry into our sovereign nation. We cant just have wide open deserts without any type of boundary. Its been open for years and our citizens have been having to deal with people illegally crossing borders, no Social Security number, not paying taxes, never go back to court to secure legal status and then get involved in crimes of which the wordt of course is murder whether its from drinking and driving or from gang violence. Either way, at some point we have to have a stopping point. Trump may not be a polished politician but he is the only POTUS so far who has had the balls to secure our borders"

neutral,Same way your ancestors did
negative,"So sorry,, so so sorry.  It should‚Äôve never happened.  This problem should‚Äôve never existed.  Nothing will ever replace what you‚Äôve lost.

negative,Kelly Preiss Wilhelm I never want to see anyone killed period. He does talk about it though.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs criminals which will always have guns ‚Äú. We could ban all guns in America.   The criminals would still have them.  Gun control only disarms the good ppl.  I‚Äôm so sorry you lost someone to this crime invested country.  And we all need to work together to push out the bad.  Not argue.  There‚Äôs a lot more good ppl than bad.  Ppl has to stand up to the thugs.  They‚Äôre out numbered by far.

negative,"Yet, you probably thought Sandy Hook and Parkland were hoaxes, right?  And, even if not, you don't think gun control will make a difference, right???  But, a WALL...well, that makes all the difference in the world, doesn't it?  You Trumpers are the dumbest species on this planet.  You seriously are."
negative,"I don't understand the level of insanity from you idiot Trumpers who, after every mass shooting in the U.S. by a U.S. citizen, claim that ""gun control doesn't work; a criminal will find a way to get a gun.""  Yet, you think some idiotic wall will keep out illegal immigrants when most of the immigrants are non-violent and most of the drugs come in through legal ports of entry, ships, and airplanes.  I mean...you're just plain dumb."
positive,Donna Williford Burger - Donna/ all these people who don‚Äôt think the wall is necessary- I have a perfect way to change their minds.... delete ‚Äú President Trump ‚Äú  Insert ‚Äú President Hillary Clinton‚Äù
negative,"Heartbreaking story, I am so sorry for this family's loss. Thank you President Trump for giving them their voice that Beto wants to keep silenced."
negative,You're missing the point. Its called a deterent. It will make them have no choice but to use those methods and will likely be shot down or sunk if so.  Why do you have locks on your doors at home if someone can just ram a car through it or break in a window? Thats your logic
positive,"Lori Olson Rasmann American taxpayers have paid for border walls in 3 other countries. What you should be thinking is why the democrats don‚Äôt want a wall. They don‚Äôt want it not because it won‚Äôt work but because it will, and they know it."
negative,"Except for the fact that, you know, a wall would of prevented it...."
negative,"That's why with the wall comes tech and other strategies, but it starts with a wall.  Ex...my house has a fence, door, locks, alarm system, guns.  It starts with a fence."
negative,I understand all this and not  trying to cause any arguments. But of his reasons is illegals killing Americans well there are a lot more Americans killing Americans than Illegals killing Americans just makes no sense that's all. And as Rich as he is why doesn't he pay for his wall ?
negative,"Lisa Mann yes Americans kill Americans..... doesn‚Äôt mean we should import murder and other violence.  Ahhhh there it is.....  he‚Äôs rich, he can pay for it......   moron"
negative,"Lisa Mann no, it will be difficult to go over, and it will have cement footers.  Since you will be able to see through it, border patrol will see digging or other things that could show other avenues around the wall.  The slats make it difficult to go through.  So, with other things that Trump asked for, like more agents and technology (which was in his package they denied, and then passed with 1.4 billion for a wall) the wall will slow down any potential illegals.  If by chance they could make it across, they will be apprehended immediately,  which doesn't happen now in areas without barriers."
negative,"No because the money set aside for Homeland Security in the future will only be raided by Democrats and used on welfare, abortion and the climate"
negative,"But it will be much,much harder.Every country who has a wall say their illegal's have dropped from 50-95% success rate.Israel is at 99%.He is on the front lines we just have news to go by,and some choose to listen and salivate to fake news..And those who believe in God and his word the bible,it's in many a scripture."
negative,Lisa Mann A Wall will make it much more difficult and time consuming than just walking in.
negative,"Lisa Mannim retired from the Michigan department of corrections,  if done right ,the wall /fences ,would stop about 99% .I was in Israel before the wall was built, they had weekly bus bombings, after wall built bus bombings stopped,  then they built a wall ,along Egyptian border, where thousands were entering illegally, know there was only 16 people get across, wall work if built right, and manned right. Thank you."
negative,This is a very sad story.  Too bad it has nothing to do with a stupid wall.
positive,Lisa Mann No all the surveillance won't be as effective. And no they won't find a way to get over or under with the right wall. Ex.. Isreal has a wall that is 99.9% effective. We need that.
negative,"Lisa Mann it would, but Trumpcucks are very very stupid."
neutral,"Worley Michael , say that up close, not behind a pc,"
negative,I'm not saying building a wall is useless just saying they will find a way to get over it or under it. Just common sense that's all.
negative,Lisa Mann no.
neutral,Kathy Smith Williams depends who the next president is walls have been taken down before.
neutral,"What else is there?  They talk about security.  Obama did.  Other Democrats do.  But the sanctuary cities and stupid laws for their protection just make things worse.  They are all talk.  A wall will work.  It wont keep everyone out, of course. But it will keep many out.  And until they show other REAL ideas, I want a wall.  I have been jumped by illegals.  I was very lucky.  Protect AMERICANS, not illegals"
neutral,Lisa Mann Mr. Trump will not be President forever but the wall will.
negative,I'm shocked USA today wrote this. In the era where media is ignoring and dismissing angel families this is a shocker
negative,"No, it is not possible.  You can see for yourself by looking back, trump's wall idea was never something the majority wanted."
neutral,Hello Dave how are you
negative,"Yeah...such an emergency.  That's why it's taken him two years.  And, he's only getting 55 miles.  You Trumpers are the dumbest species on this planet; what's left of it."
negative,Sue Carol AND he decided during this frantic crisis that NOW is the best time to upgrade his golf simulator AND jet off to MarALago right after admitting the emergency isn‚Äôt an emergency.
negative,The Mexican drug cartels have a lot of money and they know how to invest it to maximize their illegal profits. During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.  Is it possible that cartel money is now being used to change public opinion and the politicians opinions on the construction of the border wall between Mexico and the United States? I am just wondering now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
negative,Funny you should mention El Paso...isn;t that the city with some kind of wall that was put up on the grounds it would way lower crime rates...but the city was already among the safest in the country and its wall didn't lower crimes rates...?
positive,"Art Jackson hmmm, I lived down there and let me tell ya Art, not too long ago in El Paso, the drug dealers put razor blades on park swings and so forth. YOU call that safe? I do not. Try driving down there on the free way or the streets on the east side, some don't know how to drive with lines. My daughter had a friend down there whose father was found in the Rio Grande and the drones had to go find him. Hmmm safe, yeah right."

I‚Äôm guessing most of them don‚Äôt walk over the border but are not caught by the checks in place. Even if they walk over the border why aren‚Äôt they rounded up and sent back? Is it possible that there is corruption here, why are they so easily avoiding detection? A wall won‚Äôt fix issues like these, get to the core of the issue, seems like a bandaid wall won‚Äôt fix this."

neutral,Sharon Fantana
neutral,Idot
positive,"Sharon Fantana there is no big tech equipment that is going to physically stop a vehicle from driving over the border in a place like Arizona. Also if they have to build tunnels to traffic this takes time and resources of the cartels. We've been building barriers under the last several presidents. The fact is some people just dont like Trump and use it as an excuse to oppose him but that does not change the fact of what works down here and unless you have been out in the field chasing this stuff you really can't understand how much it slows them down for us to get to these places especially the more remote ones.  As far as Mexico paying for it. Like I said we've been building barriers and paying for it under the last several presidents. Now I have not read the full new deal that replaced  NAFTA but from what I've seen, been told, and understand is that we're getting a huge swing of money our way essentially paying for the wall. He never said they were going to dish out cash. There are other ways to make them pay. IR tariffs, new deals in our favor etc. People tend to be too narrow minded to think about those things because the mainstream media just pushes what they want. That's why it's more important then ever to do your own research and find the facts not just what they want to tell you."

So in many cases the fence is several miles inland on the U.S. side, dividing private land and surface streets. There are gaps in the fence in these areas so people can drive through and access that part of Brownsville. Seems like it would do more good if we fixed the EPA regulation and built a gap-less fence on the border instead of hindering access to privately owned land. I used to drive patients to their appointments and frequently pass through the fence unchecked in a 13 passenger van."

While not every immigrant is a threat to society, we cannot deny the fact some of them are, even if they're a minority. Some are even wanted criminals.  Not to mention that if Orange-man were to actually implement stricter firearm control, there would still be a lot of contraband crossing the border because of the lack of immigration control. Not just drugs, but unlicensed weapons as well.  They're basically fuel for the black market which puts unlicensed weapons in the wrong hands. this in itself is valid reason to encourage possession of a firearm to protect one's self against this threat.  I think that fixing (or at least minimizing) the contraband problem is the first step towards implementing a better, more efficient gun control project since the population will feel more secure.  Whether building a wall is the best solution is up for debate. On the surface it looks extreme, but we won't know its efficiency until it's finalized. Until then, people will have a valid argument to defend both the second amendment and the wall. Pierre-Luc Vachon"

Though we might not agree on everything, I respect your views and knowing you're a future politician, I'll give you this advice to help you on your path.

Some might have understood your position, but I think your comment is open to a lot of misinterpretations.  Nothing's wrong with irony or humor of course, though clearly stating your position is a must in this day and age (especially considering everyone takes everything as an attack nowadays). Hope this can be of some help for your future career. :3"

Please, try researching before speaking, because you definitely are ignorant in many areas, and ignorance is unbecoming!"
negative,Five dead in Illinois by gun violence. Far more deaths each year by gun violence and drug abuse. But sure.... let‚Äôs pretend a wall will solve it all.
negative,"I mourn your loss. However, declaring a national crisis and putting up a concrete wall will never solve America's immigration issues. Ronald Reagan once said  ""Mr. Gorbachev, ‚ÄúTear Down This Wall‚Äù. Bottom line, this is pure politics. It's all about satisfying his extreme right wing tea party base. Let the experts decide how best to solve our border issues. America is a democracy, not a dictatorship. The president continues to make up things and lie to the American people."

Exactly what is that?!  Most of the schools and mass shooters have obtained their weapons LEGALLY, through background checks and ""common sense gun controls!"" The Florida theatre shooter bought one just for the occasion the day of the shooting!

Not one gun used in a mass shooting in this country was acquired by private sale or transfer either! The UnConstitutional Common sense gun controls we allowed last time with the promise ""this will fix the problem"" even knowing it would not, have failed miserably and cannot be documented as saving ONE, not ONE American life!

negative,"I submit that things consistently being uncontrollable at the border for so many years proves that the only way to actually gain control over it IS to declare it a national emergency. It's clear just trying to legislate activity hasn't done anything substantial.  If alcohol is negatively impacting your liver and you continue to drink doesn't that call for stronger measures against drinking? So a doctor informs you to stop or you'll die. Yet you continue to imbibe alcohol. At what point does that become considered a health emergency? Or do you just keep hearing that you have to stop or you'll die until that actually becomes the reality. By then it's to late to respond with corrective action. ...in this case America is the ""body"" and drugs are killing the body. Over the years it's only getting worse. They say they will stop it with legislation but never really stop it. The addict is going to allow themselves to die and the members of the body are sort of not wanting to let that happen. Only the ""brains"" of the American body aren't acting in unity to get the body off drugs, away from violence and separated from corruption."

How much more does it cost for jobs working off the books so taxes don't go where they should go, where the people working off the books get hurt and can't get medical? How much more does it cost for the gangs that, for me, is walking distance from my house, and all the harm they do every single day. There were over reported 1,000 crimes in the town that was my school district's town last year, about four reported crimes a day. On my way to work, depending on the time of day, there are about fifteen day laborers waiting for off the book work in an area, usually two or three groupings of men who are perfectly capable of work, which means they can't legally get work, which means they're criminals or not here legally. These are jobs that would pay better with benefits if it was done right. We need better policies for immigration control, and we need better ways for people to come here legally. In my eyes that means we need a wall with guards, but we also need more agencies out there to speed up the process needed for those who should be here legally to do so. We need what Ellis Island was, but in New York, California, and Texas, with branches set up in each state that reports back to those three places. We need an overhaul. We need a wall. We can fix things from there."

negative,"An emergency declaration ought to be reserved for legitimate emergency situations where quick, decisive action is needed to resolve a crisis.  Trump's failure to win approval for his vanity project does not constitute a national emergency.  Typically, when someone is facing a legitimate emergency, they wouldn't undermine their own argument for exercising emergency powers by admitting that the situation is such that they don't actually need to declare an emergency.  Trump is truly such a special case, that he deftly made the case for his ""emergency"" declaration by admitting, ""I could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster. And I don't have to do it for the election; I've already done a lot of wall for the election 2020.""  Later in the same address, Trump basically admitted that his emergency declaration will not result in his Wall being built quickly.  If we are genuinely experiencing a border crisis that requires an emergency declaration from Trump, how is it that Trump was able to wait until nearly 25 months into his administration before declaring an emergency?  If the situation is so dire, and requires prompt, decisive action, exactly how will construction of a wall that would take several years to complete address the issue in time?   Sever dehydration is a medical emergency. Would you advise someone suffering from severe dehydration to begin development of a well to deal with their thirst, or would you give them a glass of water?  How do you justify building Trump's Wall to deter border crossings, when apprehensions at the southern border are near a 46 year low?  What good will Trump's Wall do to curb drug smuggling across the border, when both the DEA and the CBP admit that most of the narcotics that cross the southern border come through legal ports of entry?  How effective will Trump's Wall be at preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country, when the Center for Migration Studies of New York found that in 2016-2017, 62% of the newly undocumented were folks who had overstayed their visas, and not crossed our southern border illegally?   How would Trump's Wall address the refugee crisis, when it won't provide any of the resources needed to process and adjudicate asylum claims, nor will it lead to a resolution of the circumstances refugees are fleeing in their homelands?  ""Build the Wall!"" was never a real solution. It was a slogan.  Trump'a Wall has always been a simplistic remedy offered by an ignorant sleaze in order to appeal to the simple-minded."

As it turns out, another group you might generally expect to support the president is also less than thrilled with his order: namely, the military itself.  Responding to criticism of the dubious deployment last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis demurred: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do stunts in this department.‚Äù The soldiers being sent to the border are there to provide support to the Department of Homeland Security, just as they often do after natural disasters, Mattis insisted. The secretary did not speak to the question of whether a dwindling caravan of around 3,000 Central American asylum seekers, currently 800 miles from the border and traveling on foot, really merited the same emergency response as a hurricane.  Since then, several reports have come out showing that Trump‚Äôs original vision for the deployment, tendentiously titled Operation Faithful Patriot, was larger in scope than what the Pentagon ultimately allowed, as some of what the president expected the soldiers to do was at best wasteful and at worst illegal. The administration‚Äôs first request, CNN reported on Friday, was for soldiers to provide ‚Äúcrowd and traffic control‚Äù and protect Customs and Border Protection personnel, which some Defense officials viewed as law enforcement activities the military is barred by law from performing. That request was rejected, as was a proposal that soldiers construct housing for detained migrants, according to Reuters."

Macario Garcia was a boy of 3 when his parents moved their large family across the Rio Grande from Mexico to work in the fields of South Texas. That‚Äôs where the draft board found him, 19 years later, in 1942. Wounded in the Normandy invasion, Garcia recovered in time to rejoin the 22nd Infantry Regiment for its advance through the H√ºrtgen Forest ‚Äî some of the most ferocious fighting of the war in Europe. On Nov. 27, 1944, acting squad leader Garcia led his men up a hill toward entrenched German positions. When the first machine guns opened up amid a rain of mortar fire, Garcia ignored severe wounds to his shoulder and ankle to drag himself toward the nest. When he destroyed that position, a second German gunner began firing. Once again, Garcia attacked, silencing the gun and taking four enemy prisoners. Even then, he refused to be carried from the battlefield until he knew the hill had been taken. At a White House ceremony in 1945, Staff Sgt. Garcia became the first Mexican-born soldier to receive the Medal of Honor. A month later, he was denied service at a segregated restaurant south of Houston, and when he refused to leave the premises, the owner beat him with a baseball bat. - WaPo"

She did not even know she was doing it. Because of the drugs and the influence. It had on her. She call us. And wanted to come home for a few days. I knew she was a prostitute. And it was hard to just think that some day I‚Äôm going to get a phone call. From the police. Saying your daughter is dead. In my heart. Was a broken heart. To think what she was doing. She was MIA. Then out of the blue she called. I asked her questions. How are you. When are you going to come home. She would not say nothing. Out of shame. I would begin to cry. She would say dad don‚Äôt cry. This is my choice. So I asked her this. What are you doing right now.  She told me. She was at the bus stop. To pick up some girls. From New York. I asked why. Because her pimp wanted her to. I told her. That is human trafficking. She said what‚Äôs that. And I told her. What human trafficking is. And what happens to girls. She took the girls to a safe house. And she had to stay with them until the pimps. Muscle guys. Came and took him away. She told me they were 12 to 15-year-olds. She never saw those girls again after that night when the muscleman came and took them.  If a wall just stops one of these acts and prevent someone from getting killed from drugs to me it‚Äôs worth having the wall. If they can‚Äôt come to America legally then they should not come at all does it read those their grandparents or someone they know that wanted to come to America had to either come here legally or illegally.

He is a bully.  That is, except when he is among bullies like Putin; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling boot licker instead. The rules of basic decency cannot be found in Trump. He punches downwards ‚Äì which a gentleman should, would, could never do ‚Äì and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless ‚Äì and he kicks them when they are down. The fact that a third of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think ‚ÄòYeah, he seems like my kind of guy‚Äô is a matter of confusion and distress to people worldwide. There have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. As reported in Japanese newspapers, Trump specifically asked Japanese PM Abe to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.

negative,"More trump Bullshit:    The Actual Facts about  'Murder and Extremism in the United States in 2018'  'ADL, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY'  'Each year, ADL‚Äôs Center on Extremism (COE) tracks murders perpetrated by all types of extremists. The 2018 Murder & Extremism report provides key insights into the crimes, including motivations behind these violent attacks.  2018 was a particularly active year for right-wing extremist murders: Every single extremist killing ‚Äî from Pittsburgh to Parkland ‚Äî had a link to right-wing extremism. Among this report‚Äôs key findings:  Every year adherents of a variety of extreme causes kill people in the United States; ADL‚Äôs COE tracks these murders. In 2018, domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the U.S., a sharp increase from the 37 extremist-related murders documented in 2017, though still lower than the totals for 2015 (70) and 2016 (72).  The 50 deaths make 2018 the fourth-deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings since 1970.  The extremist-related murders in 2018 were overwhelmingly linked to right-wing extremists.  Every one of the perpetrators had ties to at least one right-wing extremist movement, although one had recently switched to supporting Islamist extremism. White supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings, which is typically the case.  Deadly shooting sprees were a major factor in the high death toll. Five of the 17 incidents involved shooting sprees that caused 38 deaths and injured 33 people.  The perpetrator of one of 2018‚Äôs deadly shooting sprees, at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, was connected to the misogynistic incel/manosphere movement. In the wake of this attack and a similarly-motivated killing spree in Toronto, Canada, ADL‚Äôs COE now tracks such incidents as extremist-related killings and has updated its database to include an earlier incel-linked incident, Elliot Rodger‚Äôs 2014 shooting spree.  Firearms remain the weapon of choice for extremists who kill. Guns were responsible for 42 of the 50 deaths in 2018, followed by blades or edged weapons.'  https://www.adl.org/murder-and-extremism-2018"

negative,"The statistic shows the number of mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and November 19, 2018, by race and ethnicity of the shooter(s). Between 1982 and November 2018, 60 out of 107 mass shootings were initiated by White shooters. The Las Vegas strip massacre in 2017 had the highest number of victims between 1982 and 2018, with 58 people killed, and over 500 injured. Additional information on mass shooter profiles in the United States  The high number of tragic mass shootings that have occurred in the United States has led to a large amount of attention on the profile of the people who commit such violent acts. A look at the worst mass shootings in the United States suggests no clear common connections other than a tendency to undertake mass shootings in educational institutions and other populated areas. However, a look at mass shootings in the United States by gender shows a great majority of mass shootings are carried out by men.  With no clear patterns between the socio-economic or cultural background of mass shooters increasing attention has been placed on mental health. Analysis of the factors American‚Äôs considered to be to blame for mass shootings showed 48 percent of people felt the inability of the mental health system to recognize those who pose a danger to others was a significant factor. Further attention has also been given to the factors influencing the behavior of mass shooters. Surveys on violence in the media and drug use as potential factors show that many Americans place blame on these influences.  In the wake of multiple mass shootings critics have sought to look beyond the issues of shooter identification and their influences by focusing on their access to guns. The study mentioned above showed 61 percent of Americans felt the easy access to firearms was to blame by either a ‚Äúgreat deal‚Äù or a ‚Äúfair amount‚Äù. Hide"

positive,"Here is a little morning history for you. Very interesting...  Thomas Jefferson His portrait is on the $2.00 Dollar Bill. This is amazing. There are two parts to this. Be sure to read the 2nd part.  Thomas Jefferson was a very remarkable man who started learning very early in life and never stopped. At 5, began studying under his cousin ' s tutor. At 9, studied Latin, Greek and French. At 14, studied classical literature and additional languages At 16, entered the College of William and Mary. Also could write in Greek with one hand, while writing the same in Latin with the other. At 19, studied Law for 5 years starting under George Wythe. At 23, started his own law practice. At 25, was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses. At 31, wrote the widely circulated ""Summary View of the Rights of British America,"" and retired from his law practice. At 32, was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress. At 33, wrote the Declaration of Independence. At 33, took three years to revise Virginia ' s legal code and wrote a Public Education bill and a statute for Religious Freedom. At 36, was elected the second Governor of Virginia, succeeding Patrick Henry. At 40, served in Congress for two years. At 41, was the American minister to France and negotiated commercial treaties with European nations along with Ben Franklin and John Adams. At 46, served as the first Secretary of State under George Washington. At 53, served as Vice President and was elected President of the American Philosophical Society. At 55, drafted the Kentucky Resolutions and became the active head of the Republican Party. At 57, was elected the third president of the United States  At 60, obtained the Louisiana Purchase , doubling the nation ' s size. At 61, was elected to a second term as President. At 65, retired to Monticello. At 80, helped President Monroe shape the Monroe Doctrine. At 81, almost single-handedly, created the University of Virginia and served as its ' first president. At 83, died on the 50th Anniversary of the Signing of the Declaration of Independence, along with John Adams.  Thomas Jefferson knew because he himself studied, the previous failed attempts at government. He understood actual history, the nature of God, His laws and the nature of man. That happens to be way more than what most understand today.  Jefferson really knew his stuff.  A voice from the past to lead us in the future:  John F. Kennedy held a dinner in the White House for a group of the brightest minds in the nation at that time. He made this statement: ""This is perhaps the assembly of the most intelligence ever to gather at one time in the White House, with the exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.""  ""When we get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as Europe ."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""It is incumbent on every generation to pay its ' own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on, would save one-half the wars of the world."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people, under the pretense of taking care of them."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."" -- Thomas Jefferson  ""To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes, the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical."" -- Thomas Jefferson"

positive,"Los  Angeles Times  03/04/2008  """"Stanford University called about Jamiel Shaw a week or so ago, intrigued by the slight but speedy running back for Los Angeles High School, the Southern League's most valuable player last year. Rutgers University called a few days later. The Shaw family already had reason to be proud. Jamiel's mother, Army Sgt. Anita Shaw, was on her second tour of duty in Iraq. On Sunday night, it was Jamiel's father on the phone and then his son's girlfriend, Chrystale Miles. Jamiel Sr. called to tell him to hurry home from the mall. The 17-year-old boy was three doors away when someone (Pedro Espinoza ) shot him to death while he was still talking on his cellphone to Chrystale,  Jamiel Sr. heard the shots almost as soon as he hung up. He ran out of the house, raced around the corner and found his son lying on the sidewalk, bleeding.""  ""Los Angeles police officials described the killing as random and senseless, cutting down a youth who had been doing everything right in his life -- from hitting the books to never missing church to inspiring the Los Angeles High Romans to last year's Southern League title. A police spokeswoman said two Latino men pulled up in a car, jumped out, asked Jamiel if he belonged to a gang, and shot him when he didn't answer. She said Jamiel was not affiliated with a gang"". ""The youth's football coach, Hardy Williams, was with the family Monday at their 5th Avenue home, where Jamiel's trophies and medals lined the mantel. His 9-year-old brother, Thomas, wore Jamiel's favorite Atlanta Braves cap. Tears flowed. ""He was a very special kid,"" Williams said. ""Not only was he an outstanding athlete, he was a good person. I've never seen Jamiel mad. He had such a big smile."" The coach described his standout player as ""a Houdini on the football field,"" and the numbers backed it up. As a junior, Jamiel rushed for more than 1,000 yards last year, averaging just over 14 yards per carry. An invitational All-City first-team selection, he scored 11 touchdowns, returned punts and kickoffs, and played defensive back. He also competed in track. Hours before he was shot, Jamiel had spent the day at a football camp at Pasadena City College, Williams said. ""Stanford just called me about his transcripts,"" he said. ""Rutgers called a couple of days ago. He was just on track. . . . He was very elated."" He is not elated anymore. He is dead. Rotting under six feet of dirt, Donald Trump is his only voice. He speaks for the Dead."

negative,"For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of ‚Äúcriminality‚Äù ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of ‚Äúfelonies‚Äù have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized."

Also, I have started to write down any pertinent names, info, addresses, email, phone #'s and I contact the appropriate offices, when I learn about any person, entity, politician or group who are doing anything I feel is harmful to our American way of life and freedom. For instance I have been writing, calling and signing petitions to have traitors such as Rashida Talib and Ilhan Omar and also Linda Sosaur ousted from their positions, and at least bring attention to them that shows how many citizens want something to be DONE about their slanderous and evil words, behaviors and deeds. It has to stop, and the majority of American citizens feel this way, or else Trump would not have won the election.

Twenty-two million.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èThe Democrat Party is now, as a matter of policy, calling for the legalization of ALL illegals in this country, citizenship voting rights. 22 million new voters. ‚ñ™Ô∏èThe overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote Democrat.  ‚ñ™Ô∏è The largest margin in American presidential history was 17 million votes in a 1984 election between Mondale and Reagan. 17 million. You would add to our voter roles 22 million at least permanent electoral majority, in perpetuity.  That's what this (this insane resistance against President Trump and his call for building a southern border wall) is all about.

negative,"Imagine if there was not a wall! What would happen? Probably, and I‚Äôm just speculating here, that illegals would simply walk across and enter our country and disappear. Illegal and undocumented, and unable to find work, they would either simply exist off tax payer dollars, straining our system, or commit crimes to get money. All the while  our vets and homeless continue to suffer, living on the streets and in makeshift shelters. And sanctuary cities and states increase your taxes to provide illegals with free benefits - food, housing, medical and education while ignoring our citizens first! This is wrong. If they seriously want to better Their lives, do so legally and obey our laws. Is this what we want America to become? Is this why some support santuary cities and states?   Consider this last point. All countries across this planet use some type of a physical border, barrier or even a simple sign post to let you know that you are entering their country. They do this for many obvious reasons, one of which is to inform you that you have crossed into their sovereignty and that you must obey the laws of their land.  Same here when you think about the continental US, between states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). Each state has boundary lines established - sign posts and in some cases check points to let you know that you are entering they‚Äôre state and that different state laws are in effect, that different state taxes may be in effect et cetera. If borders do not matter, then why would states need them, or why should their be any localized laws  of any kind in place? The reasons are obvious and our country needs a border."

I, ¬ß 2, and Art. I, ¬ß 16(b) Fla. Const. (1998), and ¬ß 839.13, ¬ß 839.20, ¬ß 843.0855, and ¬ß 843.14, Fla. Stat.  Due to incompetence of Town of Palm Beach investigating Law Enforcement Officers at the crime scene, and the subsequent and continuing obstruction of justice by supervising Town of Palm Beach Officers; the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, (‚ÄúFDLE‚Äù), Palm Beach Sheriff's Office (‚ÄúPBSO‚Äù), Town of Palm Beach Police Department (‚ÄúPBPD‚Äù), Florida State Attorney‚Äôs Office 15th Judicial District (‚Äú15th SAO‚Äù), and the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office (‚ÄúPBME‚Äù) have all refused to conduct a homicide investigation, as required by Law.  NIA LEE ANKNER‚Äôs surviving family has information and evidence providing probable cause to charge and arrest one KELLY ANNE MCCAULEY for 1st Degree Capital Murder.   In August of 2017, KELLY ANNE MCCAULEY and other person‚Äôs yet unknown, in the County of Palm Beach, and against the statute, peace, and dignity of the State of Florida, did unlawfully from a premeditated design to effect the death of a human being, and caused the death of a human being, NIA LEE ANKNER, through the unlawful distribution of opium or any compound, derivative or preparation of opium and/or fentanyl, opium or any compound, derivative or perpetration of opium, and/or fentanyl, and which was the proximate cause of the death of NIA LEE ANKNER , did kill and murder, NIA LEE ANKNER, contrary to Florida Statue 782.04(1)(a)1, 782.04(1)(a)2, and 782.04(1)(a)3. (CAPITAL FELONY).  ""Dear Governor Ron DeSantis,  I and my family pray you are well and happy; and, we thank God you are Florida‚Äôs 46th Chief Executive.  My name is Charles E. Ankner. I (and my family) seek your Office‚Äôs review of the information herein related to the homicide of my biological niece, Nia Lee Ankner (‚ÄúDecedent‚Äù); with an end goal of a competent homicide investigation being performed by an authorized Florida criminal investigative entity outside of Palm Beach County.  With your being a former U.S. Navy JAG Officer, and my being a USAF Veteran and certified long experienced paralegal; I‚Äôll strive to be accurate and brief in my presentation, and yet be comprehensive.  Quite frankly Governor, we pray the information herein will make your blood boil; and, motivate you to action.  In August of 2017, the Decedent had met a former coworker-acquaintance, one Kelly Anne McCauley, for a Saturday afternoon pool swim at another person‚Äôs residence near the Town of Palm Beach. Neither made it to the pool; and the Decedent was brain-dead from an opiate overdose within two-hours of meeting that day with McCauley. McCauley also delayed calling 911 for twenty-minutes while instead calling her newly estranged boyfriend. By the time McCauley did call 911, eighty-percent of the Decedent‚Äôs brain was dead.   Admittedly, the Decedent also had a blood alcohol level of 0.15 in her system at the time of her brain-death. The combination of an opiate supplied by McCauley and ethanol caused the Decedent to stop breathing in the presence of McCauley while she purposefully delayed summoning help. In fact, besides after a twenty-minute in calling 911; McCauley did nothing to render help to the Decedent (rescue-breathing, flag down other cars for help, going into the Office of the Condo parking lot where they were at). McCauley, beyond a reasonable doubt, after supplying a fatal illicit opiate to the Decedent actually and proximately caused her death; and McCauley also for twenty minutes stood-by and let the Decedent suffocate to death.   Kelly McCauley has a long criminal record in Palm Beach County, including for but not limited to: illicit controlled substance use and possession, illicit drug paraphernalia use and possession, solicitation of prostitution, felony armed robbery, felony battery, felony grand theft, and destroying, tampering with, and concealing evidence. In my review of her criminal record; McCauley has always pled-out and never served more than a few months in the Palm Beach County Jail.  Tragically, McCauley is an all too common Palm Beach County catch and release felon. Even more tragic; McCauley was arrested only four-months before murdering the Decedent by Palm Beach County Florida Highway Patrol, for illegal possession of Xanax; with the driver of the car she was in unconscious and the car against the center barrier of Interstate-95. McCauley has lost her driving privileges due to several DUIs.  The Decedent had no criminal nor arrest record.  The motivation for PBPD Officers to resist, ‚Äúsoft-peddle‚Äù, or obstruct any and all related criminal investigations is that instead of concentrating on McCauley related to the Decedent‚Äôs condition and ultimate death; the PBPD exclusively concentrated on collecting evidence against the Decedent for DUI. In other words, PBPD Detective Lawrence Mennetti and Sgt. Scott Duquette ‚Äúscrewed the pooch‚Äù by not processing the scene and detaining McCauley pursuant to Florida Statute. Thereafter, Detective Mennetti performed what believe to be a half-stepped sham investigation in the ‚Äúincident‚Äù and concluded ‚Äú‚Ä¶no crime was committed in our jurisdiction.‚Äù.  Just a draft.

positive,"President Trump will have the law on his side when he uses the power of his office to secure the U.S. border with Mexico.  Fortunately, both the Constitution and the Congress have placed the authority to do so firmly with the President of the United State.   Executive action may be taken where Congress‚Äôs intention is unclear, and actions like the one President Trump may be preparing to take now, where Congress has already delegated the authority to act. Since Congress has already delegated the authority to act, and with funding, this is where presidential power is at its zenith, carrying almost the full undivided executive power of the U.S. government.  When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. In these circumstances, and in these only, may he be said to personify the federal sovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional under these circumstances, it usually means that the Federal Government, as an undivided whole, lacks power.  The main unresolved question is simply how the President can use existing appropriations to carry out those responsibilities without new, specific bequests from Congress beyond the $1.375 billion in this latest bill.  The method is a declaration of a ‚Äúnational emergency.‚Äù  The 2006 Secure Fence Act, for example, commands the executive branch to ‚Äútake all actions...necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States‚Ä¶,‚Äù specifically including physical barriers. This is beyond mere ‚Äúimplied intent‚Äù of congress    Then there is the ‚ÄúThe Immigration and Nationality Act‚Äù which grants the President the authority to ‚Äúsuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.This again implies the intent of congress.  So even without the most recent Bill passed allowing funding for border physical barriers, the previous Acts already gave the executive branch clear authority to take action on border security and barriers.   Congress can not micro manage how the POTUS and his staff carries out their duties. Thats why the executive branch is seperate. Otherwise we would just let Pelosi run the country.  In this case, the emergency powers Congress has already delegated to the President are perfectly tailored to allow him to solve the border crisis. A declaration of national emergency authorizes the President, ‚Äúwithout regard to any other provision of law,‚Äù to tap into funds already appropriated for military construction and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers‚Äô civil works program.  Until Congress passes a new law or resolution ‚Äî which would require a two-thirds majority in both houses if President Trump were to issue a veto ‚Äî the legislative branch has already given the President ample authority to declare a state of emergency on the southern border and take action."

negative,""" 'I didn‚Äôt need to do this,' President Trump insisted at a Rose Garden appearance on Friday, as he declared a national emergency aimed at shaking loose a few billion dollars in financing for his beloved border wall.  ""The president‚Äôs assertion was both ludicrous and self-defeating. If a declaration was unnecessary and the wall on track (the wall is 'very very on its way,' the president said earlier in the week), how could he claim to be addressing an emergency? As Mr. Trump explained it, 'But I‚Äôd rather do it much faster.' A presidential desire for speed does not constitute a crisis ‚Äî no matter how eager a president is to camouflage his failures."" - NYT Editorial Board  ""This week‚Äôs bipartisan spending bill, which contained no more wall money than the one over which Mr. Trump shut down the government in December, was a particularly humiliating defeat.  ""Desperate to save face, the president and his team cooked up a nonemergency emergency with the aim of seizing funds already appropriated for other purposes. Currently, the plan is to pull $2.5 billion from the military‚Äôs drug interdiction program, $3.6 billion from its construction budget and $600 million from the Treasury Department‚Äôs drug forfeiture fund. The White House plans to 'backfill' the money it is taking from the Pentagon in future budgets.  ""And so, in a breathtaking display of executive disregard for the separation of powers, the White House is thumbing its nose at Congress, the Constitution and the will of the American people, the majority of whom oppose a border wall.  ""Even as he spun this as an act of strong leadership, Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration resolves nothing and creates a host of legal, legislative and political troubles."" - NYT Editorial Board  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/opinion/trump-border-wall-national-emergency.html"

Trump‚Äôs predilection not to govern, but rather rule by an unprecedented executive fiat, set off alarm bells for Constitutional separation of powers, as Trump departed early Friday for a weekend of golf at Mar-a-Lago.  This week the Mueller probe made news as reporting indicated Trump‚Äôs former campaign chair Paul Manafort discussed a peace plan for Ukraine and handed off internal polling data in a secretive meeting to a business associate with ties to Russian intelligence, and a search warrant revealed Roger Stone was in direct contact with WikiLeaks while interacting with the Trump campaign ‚Äî both in the months before the 2016 election.  At a Trump campaign-style event in El Paso, a BBC cameraman was physically assaulted by a supporter ‚Äî symbolic of Trump‚Äôs continued attacks on the media and his stoking of hatred against marginalized communities. Trump‚Äôs speech in El Paso and his declaring a manufactured emergency in Rose Garden were both a repetition of disproven lies and exaggerations, as Trump continues to propagate a dystopian alternate reality and act unilaterally.

negative,"Sorry for your loss, but also sorry you blame an entire group of people. Fact: illegals, and especially Hispanics, who we are really talking about, commit less crimes (per person) than our citizens. Fact: no one with knowledge of the situation, like the Republican congressman whose area is 2/3 of the entire border, thinks that a wall is going to work. What is working and improving constantly is technology and manpower to monitor the gates(where almost all drugs and illegals enter), and drones to cover the expanse, sea and air, where the rest of the drugs enter.  The wall was a failed campaign promise by a man with zero knowledge of the actual problem. The group to blame for you senseless loss are ALL drunk drivers."

Illegal border crossings and apprehensions have been declining for nearly two decades, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and in 2017 were at their lowest point since 1971. A 2018 study published by the Cato Institute found that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the majority of illegal drugs coming into the country across the southern border are being smuggled through legal points of entry. In other words, this president has manufactured an immigration crisis for his own political gain."

It is swinging hard working Americans to the left. You could ruin this for Nancy and her crew. You could be the champion of the working poor. You need to start a program to subsidize rent based on income. You could fund it by putting a small tax on All rental properties and corperations, sales tax ect. I think this country would be behind you on this 100%. Id be glad to add one dollar to my monthly rent to pay for this. So would big corperations. Why ?? because it would help everyone to have a nice place to call home. It also could be used to provide housing for the chronic homeless people and vets.

negative,"Tony Lamb .org  I HAD A DREAM!   I have had many end times dreams.   In my dreams I saw the destruction of America. America (Babylon) is Entering Judgement.  I saw nuclear weapons going off in most major American cities. I saw two Asteroids hit the earth. One of these Asteroids caused a Tsunami that was several hundred feet high to hit America's East coast. I saw A mega-earthquake on the west coast that caused two other faults to rip wide open causing another massive Tsunami on the West Coast. Then these earthquakes caused several major Volcanoes to erupt. I saw America ripped in half by the New Madrid fault ripping America in half from the Great Lakes down to New Orleans and this was up to hundreds of miles wide at some points.  America's heartland was turned into a great sea between two continents. And yes I saw Yellowstone erupt with a massive eruption. I was above the earth witnessing all this. But then I zoomed down and in close and I saw civil war in America. I saw Americans shooting and bombing other American's. I saw paper money blowing down the street and no one gave it a thought as it was worthless paper.  Everyone was starving and people were eating bugs, bark, leaves and grass as the hunger was so great. I saw people cooking and eating other people. I saw parents cooking and eating their children. I saw parents trading their children for a hand full of rice or beans. Cannibalism was so rampant that no one gave it a thought as it had become common and normal.   What I saw was in the Great Tribulation and I have had several dreams about this time to come. And my impression was this is NOT off in our distant future but was our near present time. I saw much, much more! The focus was America as America has sinned the most and drug or forced other nations into her abominations. But no part of the earth was spared, every nation, every island, every people, everywhere was touched by this Great Tribulation.  God has reached his limit for tolerating sin. So NOW God acts. The Holy Spirit came to me in a dream and hovered above my bed and spoke 4 words to me. ""AMERICA IS ENTERING JUDGEMENT'. I prayed, I cried and I sobbed, I cried so hard because I knew what was to come.   A great deception will soon manifest and the whole world will be mesmerized by it. The faithful needs to be aware of this and not fall into this trap because many Christians will be deceived by this.   I believe this will be alien disclouser and the ‚Äòfact‚Äô proposed by the media that aliens seeded life on this planet and ‚Äòthey‚Äô are here to help mankind. These ‚Äòaliens‚Äô are demons straight from hell and they are NOT here to help mankind but to deceive us.  I saw Fallen Angels walking the earth destroying everything and everyone before them and no weapon could harm them.   REVELATION 9: 14 & 15 14 SAYING TO THE SIXTH ANGEL WHICH HAD THE TRUMPET, LOOSE THE FOUR ANGELS WHICH WERE BOUND IN THE GREAT RIVER EUPHRATES.  15 AND THE FOUR ANGELS WERE LOOSED, WHICH WERE PREPARED FOR AN HOUR, AND A DAY, AND A MONTH, AND A YEAR, FOR TO SLAY THE THIRD PART OF MEN.  This scripture says 4 Fallen Angels will be released upon the earth and will kill a third (1/3) of mankind. (I was shown this verse after my Fallen Angel dream.)  Also a Great Shaking is coming to America soon. I do not know what form this will take, economic collapse, war, Asteroid strike, Earthquake, Super Volcano, Tsunami something big IS COMING. And when it gets here every person in America will be shaken to their very core.  ALSO I know the Rapture is very soon also. I don't know when this will come in relationship to these other events, before, during or after these other events BUT IT IS COMING AND SOON.  So pray, look up for your redemption draweth nigh. BUT we who are faithful in Jesus Christ will be raptured out of here and WE WILL NOT BE HERE for the Tribulation.

He was a human resources manager. ‚Ä¢ Trevor Wehner of DeKalb, Illinois. He was a human resources intern and a student at Northern Illinois University  ‚Ä¢ Russell Beyer of Yorkville, Illinois. He was a mold operator. ‚Ä¢ Vicente Juarez of Oswego, Illinois. He was a stock room attendant and fork lift operator. ‚Ä¢ Josh Pinkard of Oswego, Illinois. He was a plant manager.  Related Article: These are the victims of the mass shooting in Aurora, Illinois The gunman, Gary Martin, 45, shot several of the men at a meeting during which he was being fired, Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said Saturday. At least one of the slain men was found on another level in the building, she said. Martin was not supposed to own a gun because of a 1995 aggravated assault conviction in Mississippi, she said. But he obtained one in Illinois in 2014. In January of that year, he applied for a firearms owner identification card, she said. In March 2014, he applied to buy a gun from a dealer in Aurora. After a waiting period and passing a background check that did not involve fingerprinting, he bought the gun, she said. Later that month, he applied for a concealed carry permit, and a fingerprint check led authorities to discover the Mississippi conviction, Ziman said. The permit was rejected, and Illinois State Police sent him a letter demanding he voluntarily surrender the weapon, but he did not, the chief said. Investigators are trying to determine why he didn't surrender the weapon and whether law enforcement followed up with him to confiscate the gun. ""He was not supposed to be in possession of a firearm,"" Ziman said."

For example, my son got in an accident with an illegal who pulled out of his driveway and smashed in the side of my son‚Äôs car. Praise God my son wasn‚Äôt injured, but I couldn‚Äôt say that much about his car. The police told him there was nothing he could do bc the guy had no insurance, no drivers license, and was here illegally. My son had to shoulder all the expenses. Never should have happened. These incidents and more are why this problem needs to be cracked down on. Praying that President Trump resolves this problem and once again makes America safe again."

Between medical issues, underinsured/uninsured people not being able to afford medication and medial attention they need and gun violence due to untreated mental illness we have a real crisis.   If we want to stop most illegal immigration we just need to start putting the people who hire them in jail. it doesn't even have to be long, it could be as short as 30 days. however this would put a concrete consequences behind hiring an illegal."

positive,"CNN, hired by Democrats, insists on trying to ruin White House's fervent campaign for the construction of the wall on the border, CNN has never praised anything positive made by US President Donald J. Trump, or supported the conquest in the American economy, has always tried to campaign against any measure approved by the American people. The Wall should be built not to prohibit new immigrants in America, it's on the contrary, the Wall should be built to open doors for legal immigrants who want to live in America, following rules and conditioning themselves to live on the American flag in law and constituent order for good citizens. Build the Wall."
negative,"Although, wall construction may be slow, I hope everyone understands we would not even be having this conversation if Donald Trump were not the president.  Jeb Bush, no wall, Hillary definitely no wall, so the president IS getting the wall built and fighting the democrat party and half the republican party every step of the way.

And when are we putting all of the white males who have killed SO many more than immigrants in this country in kennels? I'm not belittling the loss of even one child, it's tragic and heartbreaking, but declaring a ""state of emergency"" over a few bad people who also happen to be immigrants does not make sense when we have mass killings on THIS side of the border.  A wall wouldn't stop most of they illegal immigration, we know that most come through other routes, and therefore it's false logic to assume it would have saved any of the lives he is exploiting. Do take the money allotted to beef up where they DO come through, and spend money fighting mass shootings of Americans BY Americans."

positive,"It‚Äôs a pity, Mr President. America is such a beautiful nation. A decade ago, I went to California to study. I should have fit right in, I spoke perfect English and Spanish, I was paying for my own schooling, and had a bright career ahead of myself being a hardworking person, and a Dean‚Äôs List student in a STEM field. Having gotten out of Venezuela while the getting was good, I felt I was in a land of opportunity and that with hard work, perseverance, and respect there was room for my dreams to come true in this environment. It had not been easy to secure a visa to go to America to study, and staying would not be easy either but my love of the country and its ideals made me determined to try. Life chose a different path for me. Upon finishing college, there was a full-blown economic crisis in the country. I left to Asia where young people like me could more easily find work based on special skills and secure a visa. Others in California suggested I could just stay illegally and eventually use loopholes to claim asylum and go on welfare ‚Äî but I had too much respect for myself and for the country to do that.   I have spent many years in developed Asia now and I still cannot understand how this situation is still crippling the America I once knew and loved. Over here there is no welfarism, basically no handouts of any kind, and zero tolerance for immigration violations. The result is virtually no crime and very little of thr social ills now a mainstay in every American community: single-parent households, drug addiction, and degeneracy. Over here, there is a vibrant community of highly-skilled and entrepreneurial people from overseas who call cities here home but it not a mass phenomenon. We all have dreams, as do the native citizens here, but we all understand no one has a right to break the law to fulfil their dreams.   Americans, too, have dreams. The establishment politicians and the media have allowed emotional terrorism to dominate the debate on immigration and the rule of law in the United States. Only principles can be used to rein in emotions. I pray for your country everyday and hope the principled will of the American people can win the day in these trying times."

negative,"Dear Mr. President Trump, At first, I was a bit skeptical about having a business man run for president when I believed you had little knowledge of politics. Then you began to open my eyes to the corruption that as been in the White House for far too long. Like all business men, your main concern is to protect the company which he has invested into (that being the people of the USA). If walls don't work, then why do we fence in our backyards? (To protect our children from the known dangers of the outside world.) Why do we fence in cattle when it seems inhumane to force an animal to a restricted area? (To protect the investment of their owners and others from harm). Why do we fence in our public schools? (To protect innocent children from savage people who wish unnecessary violence against the future of America). Why do we build retaining walls around our house? (To stop mother nature from destroying our shelter, our home). Why do we build walls around freeways and areas of high traffic? (To protect each other from the negligence of other drivers and to protect our people from hit and runs). Why do we build railings on our bridges? (To protect people from the dangers of failing far far below). Your interest is direct and logical. Let's protect the American people from the dangers of our Southern boarder before the danger/crime/violence happens (Still a little late because there are many of Americans who have lost love ones due to not having a wall). Democrats are doing everything in their power to stop you, don't let them! They are after the votes of the illegals, not the protection of their citizens! You sir will most likely be the greatest president in my lifetime. Opening America's eyes one day at a time. Wake up or fall victim to the violence and destruction the Democratic party wants. Keep fighting for the American people, it's been a honor to have you for a president sir!!! #TRUMP2020"

One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place.  Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.  I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR.  This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse  since then with the population of illegals.

This site details a lot of them but is by no means complete; there are many that have not been submitted. No....walls do not bring people back but they do provide security and safety.  Just look at the fences people put around their properties, the walls around the gated communities and homes of the elites.  They are there to keep people who do not belong there out.....plain and simple.  Talk to the families who have lost loved ones.  I personally know such a family.  Talk to the people who have been working the borders......they know more than anyone how much we need the wall, but it seems that people who are nowhere close to those borders and don‚Äôt know what goes on at them, think that they know better.  http://www.ojjpac.org/memorial.asp"

Trump - what a fool,  gives a speech in Munich, how disgraceful, that is just what Obama used to do - travel overseas and attack us and our country, he always apologized for America.   i am waiting to hear if Biden will plan to run in 2020 because he needs to answer one important question - is he going to continue to take his son Hunter along on government trips so Hunter can come home doing BIG deals in foreign countries like he did when Biden was VP - Hunter flew with his father to China on AirForce 2 and made a HUGE business deal for himself. of course the US media never made a fuss over that.      https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6712807/Biden-repudiates-Trumps-policies-Munich-speech-saying-undermined-Americas-moral-leadership.html"

negative,"George Winn I still say it shouldn't be an emergency.  He's president, not dictator dude. He doesn't get to dictate policy.  Congress passed a bipartisan bill and Congress decided his wall isn't needed.

There's no debate here. the point here is that the wall has nothing to do with the fact that somebody has been killed. the point is that trump is using a specific situation that has nothing extraordinary to prove his point on a global issue. You cant build a point on such an important issue by playing with peoples sentiments using tragedies. En fait c'est simplement de la malhonn√™tet√© int√©lectuelle et cela est une preuve parmis tant d'autre que cet homme exploite les sentiments, les √©motions et des strat√©gies trompeuses dans ses discours afin de contourner toute r√©flexion rationnelle puisque c'est un terrain o√π il s'est av√©r√© √™tre incapable de gagner."

Weather it is from their drugs laced with fentanyl or weapons they brought with them or illegal immigrants who think the laws do not exist or pertain to them.  Build the wall and make them come through legally and catch the drugs and weapons at the port of entry!  We can't take care of our own.  Why are we still taking care of them.  The money it takes to build the wall will be cheaper in the long run from the money we save from Narcon used to save drug attics, medical, shelter and feeding illegal immigrants not to mention the loss of life we have to endure having them here."

There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, ""homes of the rich and famous‚Äù and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    ""The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers""  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year."" (* 2017, FAIR's)  This does not include cost of loss of life, property, and Democratic stability."

Someone wants to shoot a big bunch of kids, so they walk into a gun shop, get an semi-automatic gun straight away and goes and shoots up a school. This is the problem.   The solution: the same person wants to shoot a big bunch of kids, they go into a gun shop, background checks are required and then a waiting period. Background check finds the person with multiple mental health/violence issues and are not allowed a gun. Person can not shoot up a school and overtime thousands of lives are saved."

When he tried to get a concealed weapons permit that is when they did the big enough background check to find out that he was not allowed to own that firearm so the government ran by democrats there sent him a letter to have him turn it in. Apparently he didn't care what the letter said and they never did anything about it. The blood is on the hands of the the Region's government.

negative,"My son was killed by a drunk driver also. That man was from Long Island New York. Should we put a wall there too? Odds are in the years both of us lost our kids to drunk drivers the majority of them were born & raised in the USA. Does one death matter less because of the who or where they were from?  Yes laws need to be enforced all the way around but especially on the employers that hire undocumented workers.Something so many neglect to mention or enforce. Seems even Trump branded businesses like to hire the undocumented.  Not sure a wall in the middle of the desert would make much of a difference. Ports of entry, towns, cities is different.  Everyone agrees something needs to be done just some of us see the wall as a waste of money from a man that promised Mexico would pay for it. Maybe use fines imposed on businesses that use undocumented labor illegally to pay for a wall where it would be most effective."

negative,"140 Democrats last week voted against a resolution in Congress condemning the act of allowing illegals to vote in our elections.. While they've been screaming foreign interference, they've been the ones to admit it. They found nearly 2 million non citizens on the California voting registry. That's right, they are indeed, after saying they weren't, allowing illegals and non citizens to vote. That should be Trump's next EO. The only thing Cali agreed to do, was to remove the 153,000 dead voters on their roll, but they insist on leaving illegals, and non citizens registered. I don't know how this hasn't already been stopped, but the entire party, other than maybe Munchin, should be arrested, and brought up on  high treason charges"

The person who did it had been deported multiple times with an assault record.  Can you imagine how hard she was screaming and crying as she was being raped and then being silenced as she was murdered in cold blood. This was preventable. Now tell me how this was not preventable? She was only ten. She had her own dreams."

negative,"We were hit from behind while on the way to work. The driver of the other car, an older white woman, pulled up beside us and shouted that she was going to pull off to the side of the road. Then she turned off her lights so we couldn't see her license plate, and drove off. Our car was destroyed, and I required medical attention, and she just left us there. Another time an older white woman wrecked our car, and hers, by making a left turn from the right lane without looking. She then, unsuccessfully, tried to convince the police it was our fault. Another older white woman backed into my car in a parkinglot, denting in the front and breaking my headlight. Despite doing this in front of a police officer, she hit the gas and sped off. When they caught her we discovered she didn't have insurance. Once, when driving a work truck on the interstate, an older white man became enraged because I wasn't driving fast enough in the fast lane. I had to be in that lane because my exit was coming up off of it, and I had to slow down to 60 because my truck wouldn't have made the turn otherwise. He sped up, cut in front of me, and slammed on his breaks. Somehow I managed to stop in time. If my truck hadn't been empty, I would have certainly hit him, and we both could have been killed. I have never had an unpleasant encounter of any kind with an immigrant, legal or otherwise. Middle-aged white people are another story."

And to go all the way back to 1968 to inflate the number? How many gun related deaths last year? This year so far? How many of those are outside Chicago? Don't preach to me about gun control. The number of American babies murdered since 1968 far outnumber the American lives lost to guns. SIT DOWN.

neutral,"Denise Pinto Chenier maybe you should lose a child to one, might change your mind..."
negative,"Chenier--This is just one case out of thousands every year. The liberal democrat media refuses to report on them, because it doesn't help their agenda for open border's. The point is, that these illegal's weren't suppose to be here & each case would have been one ""less case"" of a family losing a loved one to murder, or a killing by a drunk driving illegal."
negative,"Sad to see this man has lost his lovely daughter. However, this is still not a national emergency."

positive,"Jeanie Railsback, I lost my husband too, and he also died here at home. He was a Veteran from Vietnam era and evidently the VA got his records mixed up with someone that served in Afghanistan. He didn't believe me when I told him that I didn't think that the VA Hospital was really trying to help him until about a month or so before he passed away. We didn't have insurance either because we couldn't afford it and be able to live day to day.    To many foreign doctors working there with their own agendas. I don't believe that they have the lives of our Veterans and their families as top priority for surviving.    The Democrats always thought that the WALL should be built until Trump promised to see that one actually would be built. I think that a feasiblity study should have been done as to what the WALL should be built out of etcetera and how to use technology to help with patrolling and monitoring the border before doing a slapdash project."

neutral,"Um, he wasn‚Äôt even supposed to be in America in the first place?"
negative,Laws against drunk driving are already in place and are enforced.  Immigration laws have become relaxed and people try to protect those who come here illegally.  Big difference in how the 2 are addressed.  Did my friend deserve to die when he was walking down the sidewalk and was struck by a female illegal immigrant and thrown 50 feet through the air and spending the next 2 weeks in the hospital before he died. The driver was sober and had no insurance and because of her status as an illegal the state's DA decided not to press charges she lives a happy life in Rockford illinois while an American family weeps.  So how will you defend something like this.  Even more so when the person that killed my friend had no legal right to even be in the country that my friend fought and served for.

negative,"Margaret Charlton get your ignorance out of your ears. There are more factors than a simple statement to blame immigration status or lack there of. There is no actual evidence that this accident occurred because of immigration status. Peoples simple logic of well, if they where not here in the first place does not pass any body of proof tests. Theses are the facts. Someone was drinking. Someone drove a truck. Someone died. Saying this was caused from them being here illegally is not evidence. Its opinion. Saying if they where not here in the first place is conjecture. I have far beyond a GED."

The recession ended in July 2009 when GDP growth turned positive.  In just seven months, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act pumped $241.9 billion into the economy. That increased growth to a robust 3.9 percent rate by early 2010. By March 30, 2011, almost all ($633.5 billion) of the funds were spent.   2.

Obama had unemployment going down yet at the same time so was job market participation rate, it hit a 40 year low.  People were not finding jobs, they were just getting taken off the roles.

Two weeks later they found it in Larado.  The sheriff said the seats are missing.  They take them out to fit more people to bring them across the border. They like the 4 wheel drives so they can drive through the ranches.  He said they get 200 stolen cars a day like this. Not 2 but 200!!! Multiply that by as many as they can stuff in the truck without any seats. Now multiply that by 365 days in a year.  Now tell me there's  no problem at the border and I will tell you you're crazy.

negative,"What about all of the northern States like the one I grew up on that border another country and have no walls?  It sucks that you can't find a job with the skills you have, maybe try learning Spanish or move to a place where speaking Spanish isn't a job requirement... If 45 knows things we don't that make it crisis now that is more important than helping the Americans in California or Puerto Rico then why did it take so long for him to declare an emergency? Why didn't he do so in the first 2 years of his term when he was trying to get this done? It's not an emergency if you wait 2 years... Jim Jenkins - if control laws take lives, that blanket statement would mean you having a driver's license, being married in the government's eyes, or opening a bank account take lives... there are many countries with stricter gun laws that have lower crime rates. That point on gun control laws was also just simple way of showing that if you support a wall because it could save one person's life, then you should also support guns laws as they would save one person's life, or healthcare for all as that saves one life, or a full transition to renewable energy as that saves one life... more wall is a waste of taxpayer funds if it doesn't deal with the majority issues used to manufacture its need as an emergency, namely illegal immigration and drug smuggling.  Lastly saying that relatively few innocent people are killed by a gun is just plain nonsense. Try telling that to one family members that was killed in any number of mass killings in the last few years from Sandy Hook to Las Vegas concert goers... and stricter gun control doesn't mean law abiding citizens cant own guns, it just means they have to jump through a few more hoops. You loved your wife enough to file paperwork with the government declaring it, why cant you do the same with your gun? You wanted to drive bad enough you took a test showing you knew how to do so safely and show back up at the dmv every few years to reregister your license, why wouldn't you also do the same to own gun?"

He was a mold operator. ‚Ä¢ Vicente Juarez of Oswego, Illinois. He was a stock room attendant and fork lift operator. ‚Ä¢ Josh Pinkard of Oswego, Illinois. He was a plant manager.  Related Article: These are the victims of the mass shooting in Aurora, Illinois The gunman, Gary Martin, 45, shot several of the men at a meeting during which he was being fired, Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said Saturday. At least one of the slain men was found on another level in the building, she said. Martin was not supposed to own a gun because of a 1995 aggravated assault conviction in Mississippi, she said. But he obtained one in Illinois in 2014. In January of that year, he applied for a firearms owner identification card, she said. In March 2014, he applied to buy a gun from a dealer in Aurora. After a waiting period and passing a background check that did not involve fingerprinting, he bought the gun, she said. Later that month, he applied for a concealed carry permit, and a fingerprint check led authorities to discover the Mississippi conviction, Ziman said. The permit was rejected, and Illinois State Police sent him a letter demanding he voluntarily surrender the weapon, but he did not, the chief said. Investigators are trying to determine why he didn't surrender the weapon and whether law enforcement followed up with him to confiscate the gun. ""He was not supposed to be in possession of a firearm,"" Ziman said.‚Äù"

It is common knowledge in any Hispanic community in this country that an identity WITH a SS# can be purchased for between $300-$500. It is a common practice for illegals to have several... Its a cultural thing. They consider it money in the bank! They will collect government benefits with one, or two of them...then work with another...while collecting unemployment with yet another one. Their spouse will also have several. THAT is one of the reasons that they can afford to work for WAY less than an American can. THAT is one of the reasons that they are able to send so much money to relatives in their own countries. Check the stats...money sent to Mexico from the States is a HUGE source of income. Is this a known scheme by our liberal government to simply take a huge chunk of our economy and give it to Mexico? In return for what?  Why, votes, of course!  Several ID's means, THEY CAN VOTE SEVERAL TIMES!!! That is also why illegals seldom show up for court...they are ghosts!!! If the government wants you or I, for anything from a parking ticket to back taxes, they know just where to find us.  How are they ever going to find an illegal when he is several identities deep? These  invaders feel that if we are dumb enough to set up a system that is so easy to scam , they would be foolish not to take advantage of it. THAT, is why they come here to start with! I lived with these people for awhile, and know this to be true. So many are good people, but...it's a package deal...we get the POS scumbags, too. Why is this not talked about by the media?  Surely, I am not the first one to point this out? (Perhaps, I am...) The Government traitors MUST be aware of this.  If this became common knowledge outside of the Hispanic illegal community, and EVERYONE did the same, the system would threaten collapse. If the ""generational food stamp crowd"" ever found out that buying another identity for benefits was way easier than having another kid...it would become a gold rush. Is that why it is never talked about?  I think that many Americans who feel pseudo sympathy, based on liberal propaganda for these people would not have it,  if the truth was known.  On another note... I was blown away to hear that 25 Americans are killed a day by illegals.  That's 9000 a year! 4 killed in Benghazi dominated headlines, which is nothing against 9000 a year! We lost 3000 on 9/11, but, more than 162,000 dead since then, by illegals, is a much bigger story. If someone knows differently,  please correct me...if this is correct it's HORRENDOUS!!! Secure our borders...100%...before someone YOU love becomes a statistic.  Please help me, and re-post...the liberals would have all their assholes (and, their mouths) slammed shut if this information was to become common knowledge!"

negative,"In declaring a national emergency, Trump reminds Republicans: It‚Äôs all about himÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩBy Dan BalzÔøΩFebruary 16 ‚ÄúThough he expects loyalty from Republicans, President Trump has never demonstrated much fidelity to the party that he leads, and on Friday he proved it again. In declaring a national emergency to fund his border wall, the president reminded Republican lawmakers that he feels free to trample on them whenever it suits him.ÔøΩ  Trump was a solitary, and unscripted, figure when he spoke on Friday in the Rose Garden. His presentation was rambling and unfocused. He talked about trade with China and Great Britain, negotiations with North Korea, and the economy and the stock market before getting to the prime topic. Though he cast many of those things in upbeat terms, it was not a performance by a president who believes he is winning.ÔøΩ  This was, however, a more authentic Trump than the politician the nation saw two weeks ago, when he gave his State of the Union address. In that setting, Trump‚Äôs speech was laced with appeals for bipartisanship, tributes to genuine American heroes and initiatives that seemed unusual to this president and designed to attract voters outside his core coalition who aren‚Äôt with him but might be needed for his reelection campaign.ÔøΩIn the House chamber that night, the nation saw the heavily scripted Trump, a teleprompter politician who delivered his lines as written and who had his party enthusiastically behind him. He even got some applause from the Democrats, which is no small thing. His approval ratings went up afterward, though history suggests such spikes are usually transitory.ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ  Trump was in a weakened position when he gave his State of the Union, coming as it did after a searing defeat in his first confrontation with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the new Democratic majority in the House. That deadlock over funding for a border wall resulted in a 35-day government shutdown from which the president emerged empty-handed.ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ  ÔøΩTrump was in the Rose Garden on Friday because he had suffered a second and seemingly definitive setback at the hands of Congress, this time with the help of Republicans. When Trump had agreed to reopen the government absent a deal on the border late last month, he had put the fate of his border wall in the hands of House and Senate negotiators.ÔøΩTrump must have imagined that he would do better than during the first round, though there was little evidence to suggest Democrats were likely to budge or Republicans were prepared to risk another shutdown by holding the line for the president. As a result, the bipartisan negotiators agreed on $1.375 billion for the border wall.ÔøΩ  There was no way for the president to spin the outcome as a victory, and he is clearly unhappy with the deal. He reportedly complained that he could have done a better job of negotiating, though he had passed up better deals at several points over many months. Once again, he proved he is far from the master dealmaker that he long has claimed to be.ÔøΩ  If there was no appetite on Capitol Hill for a second shutdown, there also wasn‚Äôt much of one for having the president declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress to pay for a wall.ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩRepublicans had warned the president against such a move, knowing that it would represent a usurpation of congressional power over spending and that a future Democratic president could invoke the same power for issues such as gun control or climate change if the declaration survives a lengthy series of court challenges.ÔøΩBut Trump‚Äôs unhappiness played out late in the week in ways that again told Republican lawmakers that loyalty is a one-way street with him. He agreed to sign the new funding agreement, but it came at the cost of forcing Republican officials to bend to his will on the declaration of a national emergency.ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ  ÔøΩSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) was the highest-profile Republican who collapsed under pressure from Trump, announcing on the Senate floor Thursday that Trump would declare an emergency and that he would support the declaration. It was another pathetic moment for the concept of the separation of powers.ÔøΩOn Friday, Trump said he was declaring an emergency because of a national security crisis on the border, ‚Äúan invasion‚Äù as he put it. Government statistics show border crossings are low compared to past years. Trump said he had statistics that proved otherwise. (The biggest crisis on the border this past year has been one caused by the Trump administration‚Äôs decision to separate children from their parents, something still being sorted out.)ÔøΩ  Remarkably, the president didn‚Äôt even make a strong case to support his decision. In fact, he did the opposite. He went so far as to acknowledge that he was declaring an emergency only as a way to speed up the process of building a wall. ‚ÄúI could do the wall over a longer period of time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need to do this. I‚Äôd rather do it much faster.‚ÄùÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩTrump‚Äôs words are not a statement that Justice Department lawyers, who will be defending the declaration against expected court challenges, will likely welcome.ÔøΩThough he claimed the decision had nothing to do with the 2020 election, Trump sounded like a politician who was playing to his base by promising to deliver a core promise from his 2016 campaign.ÔøΩ  For Republican lawmakers, these past weeks have been a bracing reminder of the man who hijacked their party in 2016 and re-created it in his image, a man who has forced them to live with the consequences. Their relationship remains fraught, as this whole episode has illustrated. Look at the record.ÔøΩTrump upended one spending agreement, after signaling acceptance, which caused the government to shut down for a record length of time and caused embarrassment for McConnell. He stubbornly allowed the shutdown to run to the point of pain for federal workers, disruption for those who depend on government services and political worries for fellow Republicans. Only then did he cut his losses. In declaring a national emergency, he flagrantly ignored the advice of many in the GOP hierarchy and caused them to buy into something they think is a mistake.ÔøΩThe president is still a long way from having the money to build the kind of wall he promised during the campaign, though he has shown his base he is willing to take extraordinary action to fulfill that promise. For this president, that may be everything. For those in the party he controls, especially those in Congress, the week was another reminder that, when it comes to Trump, it‚Äôs all about him and rarely about them."

negative,"A Weak and Rambling President Declares a Fake National Emergency By John CassidyFebruary 15 ‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs fictitious border crisis is a central element of the political narrative he has constructed for his white-nationalist base, and it‚Äôs one he can‚Äôt easily back away from.  On Friday morning, Donald Trump walked up to a lectern in the White House Rose Garden to make an announcement... a desperate effort to put the best possible face on the humiliating defeat that he suffered on Capitol Hill over funding for his border wall. ‚ÄúWe are going to be signing today, and registering, a national emergency,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, an invasion of gangs, an invasion of people, and it‚Äôs unacceptable.‚Äù  He didn‚Äôt leave it at that; he doesn‚Äôt know the concept. Instead, he sought to justify his action by trotting out some of his old lies about undocumented immigrants, and some he‚Äôs added to his repertoire more recently. ‚ÄúWe have far more people trying to get into the country today than probably we‚Äôve ever had before.‚Äù (The number of interdictions at the southern border is running at roughly half the level it was a decade ago.) The crime and drug problem in El Paso is ‚Äúa hundred per cent‚Äù better since the construction of a border barrier. (El Paso has long had one of the lowest crime rates of any city in the country.) Federal prisons are full of illegal immigrants. (Even setting aside people being held for immigration offenses, undocumented immigrants make up a tiny proportion of the federal-prison population.)  Trump‚Äôs description of the situation at the border is almost entirely fictitious, of course, but in one sense it is real. It‚Äôs a central element of the political narrative he has constructed for his white-nationalist base over the past three and a half years, and, as he helpfully sought to explain, it‚Äôs one he can‚Äôt easily back away from at this stage. ‚ÄúI ran on a very simple slogan: ‚ÄòMake America Great Again,‚Äô ‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you‚Äôre going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don‚Äôt have a barrier, then it‚Äôs very hard to make America great again.‚Äù  In this carefully concocted narrative, the wall isn‚Äôt a mere stretch of concrete or steel fencing stretching along the border; it‚Äôs a symbol of national sovereignty and regeneration. But, if it‚Äôs so important, why didn‚Äôt Trump get it built during his first two years in office, when the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress? Trump‚Äôs failure to get his own party to support what was arguably his signature campaign pledge demonstrates that he is fundamentally a weak and isolated President. But, of course, he can‚Äôt admit that publicly, either. Instead, he said, ‚ÄúIt would have been great to have done it earlier. But I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession. And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half. People that should have stepped up did not step up. But we‚Äôre stepping up now.‚Äù Take that, Paul Ryan!  This official unveiling of the former House Speaker as Trump‚Äôs 2020 whipping boy didn‚Äôt come as a surprise. Neither did the declaration of a national emergency. Trump has been threatening to make this move for months, and Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader in the Senate, had announced his intentions from the Senate floor on Thursday afternoon. Earlier on Thursday, according to a tick-tock by the Washington Post, Trump was still threatening to veto the bipartisan spending deal that allotted $1.375 billion to border barriers. In order to get him to sign the bill and keep the government open, McConnell agreed to support the declaration of an emergency and encouraged other Republicans to support it.  Here was yet another example of how the G.O.P. leadership‚Äôs Faustian pact with Trump has driven them to enable his more authoritarian tendencies. During his Rose Garden address, Trump freely conceded that his emergency decree will immediately be challenged in the lower courts, and quite likely get snagged there. But citing what happened to his travel ban, he said he was hopeful of prevailing in the Supreme Court‚Äîan outcome that can‚Äôt be ruled out given its conservative tilt.  If this happens, Trump will have succeeded in undermining the principle that the President proposes and the Congress disposes, which is contained in Article I of the Constitution. And, as Democrats and Republicans were quick to point out, he will have set a precedent. In a statement issued on Friday afternoon, Thom Tillis, a Republican senator from North Carolina, invoked the prospect of ‚ÄúPresident Elizabeth Warren declaring a national emergency to shut down banks and take over the nation‚Äôs financial institutions.‚Äù  Trump doesn‚Äôt care about precedent, of course. After he had finished his peroration, CNN‚Äôs Jim Acosta, who is possibly his least favorite reporter, asked him to explain the disconnect between his description of what‚Äôs happening at the border and data from his own government that shows border crossings ‚Äúat a near record low‚Äù and ‚Äúundocumented immigrants committing crimes at lower levels than native Americans.‚Äù Trump dodged the question and called CNN ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù The next questioner, Playboy‚Äôs Brian Karem, followed up Acosta‚Äôs question and asked Trump to say where he gets his figures. ‚ÄúI get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily,‚Äù Trump replied. ‚ÄúAnd the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.‚Äù Another of the reporters asked to what degree outside conservative voices had influenced Trump‚Äôs thinking on the national emergency. Rather than dismissing the question as impertinent, he said, ‚ÄúLook, Sean Hannity has been a terrific supporter of what I do. . . . Rush Limbaugh, I think he‚Äôs a great guy. Here‚Äôs a guy who could speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that sometime.‚Äù Turning to Ann Coulter, who has excoriated the President on Twitter this week for agreeing to a budget deal that won‚Äôt fund the wall, Trump recalled that in 2016 she had predicted he would win the election. ‚ÄúSo I like her,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs off the reservation.‚Äù  Arguably, the most revealing exchange came when Peter Alexander, of NBC News, asked Trump to admit that the spending deal he was to sign later in the day gave him less money for his wall than he could have got before the government shutdown. Of course, Trump never admits anything. He insisted that he‚Äôd got ‚Äúbillions and billions of dollars for other things‚Äîport of entries, lots of different things‚Äù from Congress. But, when it came to the wall, he went on, ‚Äúthey skimped.‚Äù Then he added, ‚ÄúSo I did‚ÄîI was successful in that sense, but I want to do it faster. I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn‚Äôt need to do this, but I‚Äôd rather do it much faster.‚Äù  It will be interesting to see what the courts make of Trump‚Äôs admission that, when it came time to declare a national emergency, he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt need to do this.‚Äù At the least, it was good to get it on the record from his own lips. Inside the Reagan Administration there used to be a saying: ‚ÄúLet Reagan be Reagan.‚Äù In the Trump Administration such a statement would be entirely redundant. The President lets it all hang out: the incoherence, the fabrications, the mendacity, the raging but delicate ego, the attention-deficit disorder, and, occasionally, the revealing shards of self-illumination. He just can‚Äôt help himself."

negative,"This ""#Fakecrisis"" started back during the Eisenhower administration folks.. Deportations happened then when it was found to be a problem on our borders. Operation Wetback. Look it up. It's been a crisis ever since.. Since then we've had an issue with illegal immigration and its been getting worse every year. President Donald J. Trump is the only one besides Eisenhower who has had the gonads to do something about it. But.. All of a sudden it's called a ""fabricated crisis"". Most of congress.. Democrats AND Republicans are being paid off by various organizations to stop the border wall.. Albeit drug cartels, South America govts etc.. We have the right to protect our borders and I stand FIRMLY with our president. In 2006, Sen Schumer introduced legislation to approve AND fund a border wall... So far this construction that was approved has not taken place. Donald J. Trump is getting these funds now and has this legislation to back it up.. Why is Schumer and the Democrat party now against the wall.. Do some research people and find out for yourself. #Trump2020 #MAGA #KAG #BuildTheWall #BuildTheFuckingWall"
