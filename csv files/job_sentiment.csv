positive,"Some of the points on here are good ones. But the big point that some don't want to see. If we was not spending billions and billions a year on illegals. That would be money that could be used to help people with medical issues. Help vets. Help the homeless. We are spending billions a year on people who have not brought so much as a soda pop In this country. As for the water in Michigan. It was a problem long before trump was elected. If the voters in Michigan would quit voting the same people in that got them in this mess. Just maybe things would get fixed. Your water problems are controlled by your local government not the president.

During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.
