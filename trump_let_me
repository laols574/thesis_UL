Angela Wilson go check the facts Angela. Reaching out to help those refugees does not make country that does that a socialist country. That is the Christian thing to do. For trump to use those refugees to frighten Americans is absolutely scandalous. Shame on trump for doing it, shame on his followers who are buying it.
Marj Mansley Calderwood and you insult without contradicting anything she said. The left have no answers, all they do is attack a person for speaking up.
Lee Jones hey, how many accounts do you have?  I’ve noticed at least 3 with the same pics!  Guess you are a fake!
I am with you all the way, secure our borders
Angela Wilson agree so very well said

Stan Piznarski  Every Day I See The Same Ignorant Post From You... Don't You Have A Life????
Stan Piznarski how is your 401k?
Stan Piznarski On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
Stan Piznarski unless those Sorros machines are in play. 👍🏽😎🇺🇸
Angela Wilson agree so very well said
Chris Jordan G those children are not dead! A lot of them were unaccompanied and some were with people smuggling them over. But no sense in talking to someone who supports child trafficking and heartless who doesnt care if measures are taken to NOT add ONE more Angel Moms to the list. Oh by the way people are numb to Dems name calling now.
Kershner Timothy my account note fake 😂😂😂😂
Chris Jordan G keep showing yourself. People like you are why people are changing parties🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Kershner Timothy another fake accounting of events😂🤣🤣
Chris Jordan G you are a child
Ed Kramer if you think that way you are dangerous & delusional.  Following the leader is not my dna... I have have a brain that gets regular exercise.  Won't find me hiding behind jokesters & jesters
Stan Piznarski wake up! You are a joke
Stan Piznarski unless those Sorros machines are in play. 👍🏽😎🇺🇸
Stan Piznarski copy and paste much bud... no original though needed...
Wayne Alexander White  who is your President You must not be living in America as a citizen Rofl but then I’m betting you voted for Hillary so that explains a lot about you
Gary Williams Wrong! True Americans love Donald Trump! Only the communist anti-americans and the ones who stare at their mailbox all day I have a problem with our President.
Gary Williams the Liberals have had freedom to think differently for too long and it's becoming the destruction of our country so now you're seeing conservatives fed up and taking control back
Yadira Bornacelli, so if I think differently than you, I'm a Liberal, or if I'm not a follower of Trump, I'm liberal. Is it either your way or nothing at all? Until the mid election didn't the Republicans have control. Your semantics lack genuine truth and reasoning.
Chris Jordan G, Obama had the same plan, with the same technology only 6 years ago. And it passed through Congress with only 19 nays. So apparently Democrats were in favor as well.
Robin Barnhill, were those that destroyed Ferguson and other cities out in public?     Are you referring to the racists that were smashing windows, looting, burning buildings, flipping cars, injuring innocent people, throwing rocks and the like, which destroyed at least 3 inner cities? Is it those people you’re referring to?
Kristy Sokoloski, while Democrats owned slaves. But we have over come those issues. Get a grip.
Bill Ajello Really? All the Dems wanted the wall before Trump came into the picture. This is not his shutdown!
Yadira why so many lies wann be white Latina?

Stan Piznarski Maybe the President with the help of Congress can designate an easement of the much of the border as one long protected National Park or Monument and then legally use funds to protect the vegetation of the parks with a wall, due to ecological impacts from Illegal immigrants destroying the protected lands. An existing example of something similar to this would be the Roosevelt Reservation.
Stan Piznarski how come all of you mother fuckers that claim to love America so much can never speak or write in proper English?

So don’t tell me this is a Dem thing. I never should’ve voted for this asshole, he wasn’t my choice, it was just a lack of options.

Stan Piznarski  Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S. Constituents, if you ‘like’ this, like it whenever you see it.   https://m.facebook.com/The-Great-1461-Day-Adventure-360025854356893/

As soon as trump could see he couldn't  give Putin what he was asking for, like being allowed in the g8 again. And he  saw he was not allowed to obstruct justice and undermine the institutions. He then began to get revenge on those leaders institutions and allies and citizens who have opposed his agenda.  Putins plan right out of the white house, to create a new cold war against Mexico and Canada and the allies. By using immigration and trade wars and nationalism. To divide the nations and the people from each other and from their leaders. While he is creating a new three amigos alliance, of Putin Trump Kim along with other autocratic regimes. Where trump continues to meet with, and ignore, and enable their rigged agendas.
Robin Barnhill  President Trump has been negotiating for "secure borders," with new technology, haven't you been paying attention, and, with a wall. i'll bet you don't live in California, but I do, where the homeless are taking over the state with free medical care, and business's going bankrupt and our citizens fleeing the state to get away from the craziness of the democratic rule.
Melissa Negley I am praying for your recovery God loves you too !!
Michèle Biwer-Erpelding what a stupid statement
Stan Piznarski DONALD TRUMP "FOLLOWERS" LEARN TO WIPE YOUR OWN ASS, STOP WAITING FOR HIM TO TELL YOU WHEN TO JUMP AND HOW HIGH, THINK FOR YOURSELF, IF YOU HAD ANYTHING HE WANTED HE WOULD STEP ONNNNNN YOU!!! IF HE CARED AT ALLLLL ABOUT AMERICANS, THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WOULDN'T BE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF HIM, NOT LIBERALS NOT REPUBLICANS AND NOT DEMOCRATS, THIS IS ALL HIM. WANNA BE RUSSIAN DICTATOR!!!! DONALD TRUMP IS A TERRORIST... a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
Michèle Biwer-Erpelding unless your child was not murdered by an "illegal" immigrant why would you be heartless and uncaring? You support another Angel Mom be added to the list. Shameful

We want modern technology, the same technology that the criminals are using! If we dont step up to the plate and modernize how we secure our borders the drug cartels and the few illegals that try will breach the outdated wall. Please remember walls can be tunneled under, climbed over and in some cases through the walls themselves! Let’s use our heads please!

Stan Piznarski he is a terrible deal maker, it’s all a fraud!  More importantly he is either going to back down on China or eclair he made a deal, but it will be a deal that weakens America.  I don’t ask you agree, I understand your support and I support you as an American.  Please scrutinize whatever deal he makes with China though, don’t just believe “it’s great” because he says so.  The future of America relies on it.
You obviously don't have a mind of your own.

Hahaha is that seriously the best you have? A few insults from Brainwashed idiots who think Moron Don actually cares about them? *Yaaaaaaawn* And as for blasphemy? Who cares what Christians who want to stop people seeking shelter think? If Jesus came back you'd label him a Leftie Commie Democrat anyway :') Come stalk my page, tell me I'm not pretty :p You utter morons...

Gary Kane oh, Gary, don’t be so gullible. Change the channel once in a while.
John Baron what s stupid comment. How many multi billion dollar companies have you built? National Enquirer... is that really the best you’ve got?🙄
You do know nobody climbs a fence carrying a ton of cocaine right?
And cook your own food if you don't like the service :D its simple. Not like McDonalds isn't making Billions worldwide? They could easily pay a decent living wage. They just want more bonuses for the parasites at the top.
Joaquín de la Maria you're a Mexican National.  That explains a lot. Stay in your lane boy. Are you in Florida legally.
Donita Piitz our FB idiot Joaquín de la Maria is a Mexican National. He lives in Miami Beach Florida. I wonder if he's here legally.
Corby Hall-Morris this FB MORON Roy Meston can't read. He inbred for sure go to his page see his pic
Roy Meston You think with your brain? Then answer my observation....gurgs enter prisons by PEOPLE allowed to enter through the doors...they don't pass through the walls. The WALLS do their job...they keep people in and keep people out...
Roy Meston That is the purpose of fencing ...barriers...they DETER....DETERING is not a waste..
Gary Kane ok, so how many are you willing to house?
John Baron what s stupid comment. How many multi billion dollar companies have you built? National Enquirer... is that really the best you’ve got?🙄
"I can't have my own way *stamp stamp*"
Not at this rate lol. They'll need to run Hillary against him again for that to happen :')
Of course they do Carol :D
Funny how you all believe a Rich Australian Immigrant but hate immigrants :')
Gary Kane you cant possibly be that stupid.
Roy Meston it's a cost that has to be met with an increase in cost for other things to pay a dumb burger flipper 15 an hour and they still can't even fix them right
Joshua that's a side issue. We're talking about a pointless wall here :D
Wow, fellow commenters......roy m must be in DESPERATE need of his meds!  😆😅😂  He is COMMENTING and CAN'T SHUT UP!  🤗  So, its time to put him on IGNORE and not use his full (fake) name and talk ABOUT him but NOT to him.  😎🖒 SOO-OOO needy and "working" hard to earn his sorosbucks and trying to be RELEVANT........and hiding behind his fake account. 😂
Monika Hernandez you say good and compassionate like they're insults? hahaha
Phew...So you're just a result of Fox News Brainwashing then?
Shady Michelle, your tampon goes in the front, not the back, read the instructions on the package first before you insert
If you say so. And I have no Trump supporting friends. You're all idiots. #NotSarcasm
Gary Kane, please put down the bong, you've had way too much!
Continue your "mockery" though :D
Gary Kane GfY
Its like they think they're punishing us by cutting off our supply of stupidity John? hahaha
Charles doesn't know why a republican cheering a monarch is funny though :D I would miss his stupid ass :D
Trump isn't a President. He's an idiot. He will always be an idiot.
So Charlie you didn't answer my question. Are you actually special needs? I'd hate to be a bully if you were?
And yet Moron Don is the one having the temper tantrum Anya?
So Janice you admit the wall won't stop them?
Charles have you worked out why I'm still laughing at you?
hahaha you would think The Idiot Army would love Hillary? She's the only reason Moron Don is President :D
Charles I don't care about that parasite :D
You think hailing her is making fun of her? :o Are you Brain Damaged?
You shouldn't use words you don't know the meaning of. It makes you look stupid Charlie.
Charles Sneckenberg orange buffoon is not a president. Geez you jockstraps are so retarded...
And double Irony, descendant of European Colonist tells somebody to go back to where they belong :')
Look at thus cuck
You shouldn't use words you don't know the meaning of. It makes you look stupid Charlie.
Trump is a bully and a liar, not good qualities in a leader
Dallas McIntosh for real
Gary Kane you’re either for the American people or for the illegal immigrants and if your not for the American people then you’re a domestic enemy of the United States.
Who the hell is Jerry?
I hope he types better than Charles?
But then he has no hostages. That won't work to get his own way.
A republican hailing a monarch...Nobody tell Charles why that amuses me so much. See if he can work it out for himself? :')
Nicki Michelle, Satan isn't real either :D hahaha
He's not a President :D He's a temper tantrum with a modicum of power :')
Gary Kane Hmm,  I guess I have as much right to speak as anyone else.
Am I allowed to drown bigots in the bath? I doubt it would help then?.
Chaos? 🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣
Errrrrrm how many Children do you think have died in American Bombing runs since 2002 Kathy? How many kids will die trying to get into America? Or are you just talking about Caucasian Children because your imaginary friend only cares about white babies right?
Nicki Michelle, you didn't evolve at all right? Still thick as the Clay you were sculpted from by the "god" in the darkness?
Gary Kane  NO. Each Refugee costs tax payers $82k per year. You pay tax payers are already overburdened by illegals needs
Roy Meston You said he was gonna be gone last year...... 😅🤣😜 Better go check with Cohen, he's going to the slammer... he might have some "breaking news" for ya... 😅
I was never in the country. That's the problem with you Republican idiots, always believe everything you read on the internet :')
And they were welcomed with open arms before Raping and Murdering everything in sight. I know history well. Good solid Christians they were. hahaha
I'm sure "god" is rewarding them as we speak? :')
Let’s just see you invite a dozen into your home.  You feed and clothe them. You pay there medical bills. Cause that is exactly where working Americans tax dollars are going.  We have enough hungry homeless people in our country that should come first js. Besides your democratics voted for a 50 billion wall before Trump became President don’t you even care what happened to that money don’t you wonder how Nancy and chuck became rich while serving our country and don’t you even wonder why they want so many illegals here they are allowing the law to be broken and doesn’t it bother you that they all have walls and fences around their homes for their safety. Truth is they use the illegals to get votes once they get illegal votes they don’t really care about them either. They only care about themselves and power. Wake up js
There's a reason you aren't Europeans anymore. I see you still haven't learnt how to play nice with others?
Fitz Ray damn right.
Gary Kane , what if the Mexicans decided to build stairs on their side of the wall?
Gary Kane  NO. Each Refugee costs tax payers $82k per year. You pay tax payers are already overburdened by illegals needs
Greg Pyles we’ll even help him to the border, liberal jerk he is.
King? You mean Queen right? and we got her because some rich dude made the poor fight a war in Gods name so he could take the throne. The Royals have no power here by the way? They're figureheads you moron
Just don't take their beads or blankets man...

Donita Piitz mine went down... Blame your state not the feds.
Troll is the cry of the weak minded by the way :D
Patricia Smith its up because Trump moved his businesses back to America from Asia. Guess what happens when he's voted out?
I'm just more intelligent than you and you don't like it ;)
Gary Kane I’m sick and tired seeing discrimination against the wrong people, so many poor Americans, while there’s a civil war going on to let more poor come in.  If you have clue about fiscal responsibility you would ask your self- we owe China so much from borrowing - when are they going to foreclose??
Build the Wall!! Only Ignorants Idiots don't want the wall...... Typical Dummyrats #MAGA Send these low life illegals back
Yaaaaaaaawn. Moron Don called a President weak for doing it...I just used his own words :D
Gary Kane , right! COME HERE IDIOT to FEEL what it's like to Live in a sanctuary City!  Only a matter of time before they are your neighbors! When your Children are being taught in TRAILERS!n LAS VEGAS! CRIME , DISEASE! Come see! until it hits home and YOU Suffer NOTHING WILL change!
داعم الأنصار: Amaq Agency A number of the Pakistani forces were killed and wounded during clashes with the Islamic State fighters in the area of Orakzai in southwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa district in northern Pakistan #islamicstate
Roy Meston  Mexico stole the land from the Indians first then Texas kicked Mexico off the land . So technically we saved the Indians from Mexico. They were actually killing them saying they are nothing more than subhumans that need to be exterminated.
Gary Kane stfu
Gary go live in war torn and drug infested country and see how much better you have it there not to mention a FEAR of your safety and freedom, HUH ???
There's a simple reason all you Republicans hate immigrants. You stole the country from its natural inhabitants and now you're afraid its going to be repeated lol :D
See Brian Martin :D you have so much incommon with Mexicans already
Gary Kane , right! COME HERE IDIOT to FEEL what it's like to Live in a sanctuary City!  Only a matter of time before they are your neighbors! When your Children are being taught in TRAILERS!n LAS VEGAS! CRIME , DISEASE! Come see! until it hits home and YOU Suffer NOTHING WILL change!
Build that wall...Ask Germany and Europe..This Country is next period ..so you socialistic assholes take a hike..Patriotism will win.. all their doing is dividing this country..Democrats leaders don't give a rat's ass about you or this country you have a President that cares unlike Odumbass ...vote Pelosi and shumer out theyre just puppets anyway smh wake up
Roy Meston do you have a door on your home? Do you lock it?  It’s the same concept as the wall. Keeps out the criminals that want to enter illegally. Nothing wrong with immigration done legally.
James Stewart you mean that pedophile Creepy uncle Joe?
Never been burgled Michelle?
Your arguements are all weak as water.
Angel Moms? Using gods name to justify hate Again!
Roy Meston can you provide facts to back your statement?!? Conspiracy theories aren't fact....just want to make sure you know that.....also, HOW DO YOU KNOW? Just speculation right?
Roy Meston no Nancy pelosi has that award
Roy Meston I say deporting liberals would get Mexico to build the wall 😃👍
Roy Meston 90% is a slow down buddy but I'll take it over open borders ANY DAMN day
Jereica Renea Kirby well said
Jereica Renea Kirby see your problem is you think balls are what you use to make an educated comment...
So you want to waste tax payers money to slow it down now? That doesn't seem like a good expenditure?
Well how does that happen? :o
I use my Brain. Works way better.
Roy Meston your comment is just funny.. I mean really? Of course building a wall won't fix everything over night, but it's a DAMN start. At least there is an idea on the table.... I'm mean really?!? And you have the DAMN balls to try and talk about people's IQ's...
America need wall.idiot.you don t know what happening here??
Todd Cuson dumb dumb dumb comment... geezzzz ... stupidity is a choice

Kathleen Reilly Mallia So you agree we are a Constitunal Republic governed by WE THE PEOPLE through our elected representatives?

The wall is a waste of money, time, energy. It's useful only to feed an ego. Invests in technology and education.
Roy Meston   Only because he was a stinking traitor and divider of the country.
Gary Kane needs his meds
William Bush 🐀
Well Jerry I suppose a Moron Don supporter would know uninformed when they spot it? You have a lot of practice watching Donnie Boy :D I'll bow to your expert opinion
Roy Meston   Only because he was a stinking traitor and divider of the country.
Well Jerry I suppose a Moron Don supporter would know uninformed when they spot it? You have a lot of practice watching Donnie Boy :D I'll bow to your expert opinion

Because I like both sides of an arguement before making my mind up? If you think that makes an idiot then no wonder you like Moron Don :D
They have been temporarily continuing for too long. Pass a real budget. No more resolutions to buy time cause it never gets done. We need all these losers out and fresh blood in there. At least Trump has new ideas and isn't politics as usual!
And then hiding because he's a coward :D
Everything goes up either way :D
Tax freezes for Moron Don and his friends while the masses slip between the cracks seems to be this administrations golden idea
Linda he's holding 800,000 of his own people hostage to get his own way. That's a Dictator, not a Leader

So you say stop the chaos in your staff ? But in mean time the chaos that goes on in government the outlandish spending, sexual misconduct, rape, the payoffs the chaos in government and your ok with that and you bitch about his administration? Hmm do you not see the problem with this ?
William Bush it’s a figure of speech dumbass,, you snowflake illegal love idiot got no brains
Gary Kane:  The Democrats cannot be trusted.  They are trying to lay a trap for Trump.  He MUST have wall funding BEFORE re-opening the govt.
Your an idiot. You must be getting free government handouts
Gary Kane what a line of bs. You must be a lib
if he opens the government then he has admitted defeat
Gary Kane build the wall
Awww Brian Buckley...still sucking that pablum?  Just found one of CNN’s 8 viewers!  Lol!!  😂😂😂
BUILD THAT BARRIER!
Yet NANCY put out a screw you letter to DACA and the workers BEFORE he even uttered a word.  Sadly this is 100% about TRUMP.. screw the country.

1) They won't be sending quite as much money back home. 2) We won't be educating their children. 3) We won't be spending as much on Illegals health care. 4) Less Welfare and Food Stamps. 5) Fewer Criminal Illegals in our jails. Yep! Mexico will be responsible for all this. Hmmm,still think Mexico isn't paying for that wall?
Paul Pietrantonio On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan, told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
Diane Ohize, That analogy of a wall that separated two countries, one free and the other over a communist dictatorship is typical of the kind of narrative the Democrats sell to the vulnerable and uneducated for many, many year's now!!If criminals from other countries were sneaking into a communist country seeking a better life you could use it however we know it's apple's and orange's so let's just "their you go again" do you remember Regan using that phrase everytime the Democrats would try and slip one through the goalie!!
Yet NANCY put out a screw you letter to DACA and the workers BEFORE he even uttered a word.  Sadly this is 100% about TRUMP.. screw the country.
Paul Pietrantonio fixing the problem would be devoting resources to legal and safe paths to legal immigration and legal and safe asylum application. The only reason to deny these is to keep America white.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/two-charts-demolish-the-notion-that-immigrants-here-illegally-commit-more-crime/
DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old. Here are 30 ways Americans are feeling the pain:  1. 450,000 public workers are being made to work without pay, including members of the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, Border Patrol, FBI, and Secret Service. 2. 350,000 public workers have been temporarily laid off. 3. Tens of thousands of federal contractors have been laid off for a month, including janitors, security guards, and cafeteria workers. They are losing up to $200 million a day. It is unlikely that they will ever receive pay for the time they have missed. 4. Nearly 10,000 companies that do business with the U.S. government are losing money, according to the Washington Post. 5. Pop-up food banks have opened up to feed unpaid government workers. 6. The four week shutdown is costing the U.S. $200 million a day, or almost $6 billion so far according to analysis by The New York Times. 7. Unpaid TSA workers have been calling in 'sick' or quitting, leading to longer security lines and missed flights. Some airports have begun closing terminals. 8. The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9. Air Traffic Controllers, who were already suffering a 30-year staffing low, have been feeling the strain of going unpaid. Some have begun quitting. 10. With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21. The FTC's identity theft reporting system is shut down. 22. Student loans are being delayed as universities are unable to verify parents' income with the IRS 23. Small Business Administration loans have been delayed. 24. Domestic violence shelters that receive federal funds have been forced to cut services. 25. Highway and transit projects are being delayed or canceled. 26. Wildfire preparations in western states are delayed. 27. The National Hurricane Center's research has been delayed 28. The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo are closed. 29. Funding for Section 8 housing assistance has lapsed, placing low-income families at risk of eviction. 30. Civil cases in federal court have been delayed. Lawsuits against Donald Trump in federal court are on hold.
Paul Pietrantonio you love him for what? What has he done? What good work has he done or will do? Pleas educate me.
Harold Kupers, it's not all about me it's what he is doing for this country, besides what he has done for me!! This country has a booming economy and when I ran a corporation in NYC I always said we needed a businessman to remove all the crippling regulations and high taxes to allow businesses to grow and hire more people,  he is bringing respect back to our military and police officers who sacrifice their lives to provide our security!! Our Country is a safer and more economically capable of bringing the American dream to all those who seek it legally!!

Todd Cuson, eventually with the help of GOD you will find that even when you disagree with someone that it's always better to use actual facts when making arguments!!PEACE
THIS is a key point not enough people have been making.   Under questioning Trump *actively hid from U.S. intelligence what he'd been doing*. And if Flynn knew any of what Trump was doing, so did he, as he was in the classified briefing with Trump on August 17, 2016.  And didn’t report either the deal or the contacts as the FBI requested in their security briefing, and lied about both  In that briefing, U.S. intel was *also* informing Trump that the Russians were going to try to infiltrate his campaign to influence him. It's evident that those statements (plus questions) were intended to provoke disclosures from Trump about whether any such effort had begun. Beyond having spoken to the briefers, Mueller would know from Flynn exactly what Trump said during that meeting, in other words how many lies he told to law enforcement bout his contacts with the Kremlin. And those lies, told during a criminal investigation, would be *crimes*.  That's why I have Making False Statements on the list of "collusive crimes" (in this particular fact-pattern, i.e. the Trump-Russia investigation). Because that's almost certainly what Trump did on August 17, 2016 and Mueller would have multiple witnesses to confirm it by now.
Paul Pietrantonio gimme a break.  He's a lying charlatan and you're defending him.

It’s easier to tell Trump to end shutdown than to stand up to Tyranny and Tyrants. Get a backbone people.

Susan Dawn McGuire how come these people are "angel families" while Trump calls the victims of school shootings a the hands of white Americans "crisis actors" ??  When has he met with them?
He is not just ignorant--which could be the case for a smart person or one of average intelligence who was just too lazy to learn.  He is not just allergic to facts because they tend to undermine his worldview and reveal his cons and his crimes. He is actually a full-fledged nitwit who is as unfamiliar with logic, sound reasoning, true insight, a sense of consequences, the relevance of context, as he is with ethics, or values or taste.  Yes, he is a traitor and a criminal and a vile hateful person. But we must always remember that which he reminds of every time he opens his mouth or Tweets his Tweets.  He is dope, a maroon, a useful idiot to some and a dangerous idiot when it comes to all the rest of us.  He is a dim bulb who has left us all stumbling around in is darkness. Time to flip on the lights America and see this guy for who he is and for what he is not.  Later we can determine the role dementia or drugs or lack of education or arrogance or just bad genes played in the creation of this pinheaded ninny of a cretinous nincompoop. But for now, as you weigh our circumstances and likely outcomes, always remember, it is not just bad character or greed or evil at work here...though they too are all present.  It is that our president is also just plain dumb.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak   Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S. Constituents, if you ‘like’ this, like it whenever you see it.   https://m.facebook.com/The-Great-1461-Day-Adventure-360025854356893/
Carl Ostendarp  Do you even think before you write your senseless crap. I don't think so.I'm a true american and I vote for who's good for my country. Tell me why did Nancy & Chucky vote for a wall when Obummer was in office but now they don't. They just don't give a dam about the U.S.A. All they want is power. I mean I have 2 brain cells that rub together and create though. It's a no brainer. The zombies that hate President Trump because he showed that the democrats in office hate us because they don't want to the power that they have they just want more. Wake up the dream is here and not the nightmare. Best wishes from an american who loves his country. And if you don't like it then leave and try to find a better one. Because you may look but you're never find it.
Carl Ostendarp You are absolutely wrong and inept . Better change the channel and realize you are being lied to 24/7
pelosi and the useful idiot dems put illegals over those workers... its sinful.. stop protecting illegals you freak... and protect those workers and ALL in the USA...DUUUUH
Cindy Cripps-Prawak your a jack ass.  He’s the only one working on deals they say know.  Clump Out of the rock your under.  It’s pelosi fault. Taking vacations. Not trump. And we need a wall.  I’m American.  And I want to hear English in my country. I’m sick of no hablo English.  Learn our language

Cindy Cripps-Prawak what?
As today and yesterday and this entire shutdown episode have revealed the president is not just corrupt or disloyal or hateful or incompetent or unfit to hold the office.  He is also stupid.  That's not something we say in polite political debate.  But it's a fact.--

Cindy Cripps-Prawak that’s Nancy dear lady
Carl Ostendarp he did take responsibility for shutting it down.  But Democrats are responsible for keeping it down for this long.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak what?
Cindy Cripps-Prawak it seems that Trump is the only one trying to open the government. He went from a wall to fence sections and offered everything that the Dems wanted. Security on the southern border is a real concern and must be fixed. But liberals like illegals voting for them
Tonja Tyree In the interest of accuracy ... Pelosi was not in Puerto Rico.  It was members of the Hispanic Caucus.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak you moron
Cindy Cripps-Prawak DONALD TRUMP IS A TERRORIST... a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
so screw the 99.5% of all working americans????   those govt employees will get back pay - but how bout all the murdered victims? their families? the drug runners gang members conming across the border?  OPEN YOUR EYES
Dana Duke Hollis "I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it." ~ Donald Trump
Cindy Cripps-Prawak what about when OButt Head and Clit held the medicare cks from the senior citizens like it was THEIR MONEY?  It was money they had paid into from working-thats was A-OK
If it wasn't for the "Well, what about" arguments, you guys would have nothing. Let's live in the now!
"I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it."
https://youtu.be/YsmgPp_nlok
Cindy Cripps-Prawak wrong!!
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  he offered them a deal. The ball is in the democrats court now. Blame it on the democrats.
I love watching trump lose everyone knows it’s a trump shutdown he thought he would make deals through twitter but he’s losing like a bitch maybe a hooker pissing on him would cheer him up
Cindy Cripps-Prawak : oh damn, are you ignorant.
Dave Mosley Jr. The only one dilusional is you.
Corby Hall-Morris "I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it." ~ Donald Trump
Cindy Cripps-Prawak wrong!!
Cindy Cripps-Prawak I think it's Nancy!
Sha-nee Lacey that might be your problem. Facts are easy to find. Do your own research. If it’s s problem maybe you could find a third grader to help you.
Ryan Clunes looks like the brainwashing has worked rather well......
Cindy Cripps-Prawak let one of your loved ones get killed by these criminal/gang member illegals and see how u feel then! Build that wall!! Trump 2020!!
Corby Hall-Morris "I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it." ~ Donald Trump
Dave Mosley Jr. You people! Are you calling us You's? How dare you call us a YOU. Oh wait I just called you a you. :) Lighten up.
Jerry Matthews Smith I am gonna take that as a no since you did it not once but twice. How about throwing some of those facts you claim you know. PS I have read both. First one is good but that second one needs work or at the very least I have found that the majority of reader should at least consider finishing the book. it has 2 parts and some of these folks seem focused on the first one like they have never even read the second half.
Build the wall and protect Americans for once. Sorry democrats.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  You mean like your buddy Bill Clinton did for 21 days and Obama did for 16 .
Randall Nadeau Ryan Clunes is not delusional honey you are. All Ryan did was actually read Trump's history. Seriously the problem is not Ryan who actually bothered to read Trump's history before speaking the problem is you who is willing to let one decent behavior overshadow decades of lying cheating criminal activity
Jerry Matthews Smith were you not capable of arguing Ryan's comment on what he said?
Chase Blood McConnell
It's both parties
Colleen Marshall Vaneps you do know that's a lot like saying don't worry I know you're starving now but I'll feed you next month
Ida Lisa Heard They did pass a budget.  Drumpf refused to sign it after Ann Coulter and other Fox News personalities lit his ass up.  The idiot makes his decision based on tv shows.
Deborah Martin so all they have to do is cave to a toddler got it
Cindy Cripps-Prawak so it’s ok when the democrats shut the government down
Deborah Martin so all they have to do is cave to a toddler got it
🐑
it's the demo RATS fault at this that these people are not getting paid (but eventually will get paid), dems are stupid and ignorant, we need this wall, walls work, they work in all the other countries that WE actually paid for!  I know these demo RATS got ants in their pants, but they need to let go now and work w/ our president and get this wall up now.  no more pussy footing around here you dems, you need to wise up and see what you dems are doing to this country, you are all (demo RATS) destroying our country by letting illegals thru our border and eating up our money and OUR PEOPLE are the ones that are hurting and suffering, doesn't Pelosi know many of these illegals have killed our people?  what is wrong with her?  OH, yes, she has dementia or much more a mental problem and does not know what she is doing.  what would she do if an illegal killed one of her kids (if she has any) or grandchildren or a loved one?  I guess she would just ignore it, thats her.
Faye Lemke Hamilton oh my goodness we are well aware that the budgets come from the House of Representatives but some of us are actually aware that the house put forth several budgets voted past good to go however the house can't do that by themselves the holdup is now sitting firmly on McConnell shoulders there's no denying it stop trying
Cindy Cripps-Prawak 🤔🙄
Chrystal Renee Van Horn  Not everyone voted Trump in for his promised wall.  Some just did not want Hillary.
Sara Levine lol....u stupid
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  With statements like this, you show your true ignorance.
Debbie Reed Duffy she’s Canadian, so she is so dumb she doesn’t know it’s done. The shutdown didn’t affect her.
Faye Lemke Hamilton that’s because Cindy is Canadian.
You spelled pelosi wrong
Sara Levine lol....u stupid
Cindy Cripps-Prawak no.....hes seeing who is necessary and who isnt.... big government is evil.

Yanira Blanco what have any of the four people you mentioned done to deserve prison time? The last time I checked a bunch of Trumps people were going to prison including his personal lawyer, campaign manager and national security advisor. Trump is under 17 investigations. But yes, lets put the elderly billionaire George Soros in jail- who by the way is a super generous billionaire that actually gives his money to charity unlike Trump who ran a fraudulent foundation.  What is your obsession with Soros anyway? I think you might be watching too much right wing propaganda.
Ronald Bettney good work my ass.

You know what they say about those ranting about joint  accounts right? Joaquín de la Maria you simply have nothing of value to add. Really? Who are you to attack a joint account? Logic would say a couple has ZERO trust issues if they are comfortable enough to leave social media info accessible to a significant other? No thots in the dm 😂  Seeing who you placed you're money on the wifey you're a likely dealing with your own serious insecurities or perhaps guilt?  Nice profile. Bless your thot heart. 😂#jelly

Worth reminding folks that Trump could have had $25 billion for border security a year ago. But Trump, using an all-or-nothing approach, also demanded steep cuts in LEGAL immigration as well. So he wound up with nothing

NO! Sad day in our country when Muslims are in our Congress and putting down our President and also Israel. God help us.

Aiming tclose your bank accounts and put you in credit agencies and soon you'll have to be borrowing against your wage with lunatic interest rates each week to be paid.

Shirley Terry Harrow stop spreading trumps hateful lies-
Jim MacKey right Mitch won’t let them vote because he knows they will pass the bill without funding baby boys waaaaaaaaaaaaal - it is disgusting what they are letting donald get away with
Jim MacKey yes lol
Jim MacKey yep couple times lol
Jim MacKey you mean like Pelosi not meeting with the Angel Moms?
Shirley Terry Harrow make that under ground.
The dummycrats are about to fold
Bette Ford  When will they be paid...Lyin Donnie said it might take months....how about if you were furloughed.....knowing eventually you will get paid.....Time to get real Bette and stop with the platitudes
Edward Burkard  Ed....it’s immigrants for those who didn’t get a Middle School GED
Bette Ford  Please cite his compassion actions....like keeping all those children in internment camps?  Bette, time to go back to your namesake clinic and get a grip?
Shirley Terry Harrow make that under ground.
Shirley Terry Harrow : Nancy is embalmed. They took her heart out when they mummified her face.
Shirley Terry Harrow  Shirley, you’re FOS.....it takes a heart of stone to deprive 800,000 workers of their paychecks....fool!
Shirley Terry Harrow you are confusing Nancy with he's the one screwing you. too dumb to know
Shirley Terry Harrow you really don't expect humpty dumpty trumpty's family to be affected. Even though he relates to average Americans. What a fake
Bette Ford  No back pay, no free food...one of three times received 3 months severance pay...that was it. To be fair, fortunately my wife worked and I did child care to save $$$....and that was OK too. Mitch McConnell has the power to stop this but won’t allow a vote because if he did, Lyin Donnie would look like a fool
Dim af
Shirley Schauss and all you want is some of that orange dripping from your lips
The asshole had 2 years to get his wall while he had the power and couldn't, now he doesn't have the power so he blames Dems.What a fool.
Shirley Terry Harrow Nancy will reject having ilegal imagrants at her home but apparently has no problem subjecting the rest of the Country to the cost of there entry into this country living off the rest of us
One strong woman.  Mexico will pay for the wall.  Quit being a dumbass.
Shirley Terry Harrow you think if someone’s family was hurt they become racists?
And meeting with lobbist lining there pockets while other people are out of work shows how much they care
Shirley Terry Harrow you think if someone’s family was hurt they become racists?
Cameron Kelley WHAT?
We need to vote on our congressman aswell

Shirley Terry Harrow her heart is made of cold stone

Build the holey Jeffcoat wall.....
Nigel Leitch that's right boy. Build it and even idiots like you might be safe!
David Owens Jeffcoat Yeah, proposals like arming teachers so when the cops arrive they will probably shoot some teachers too like the bar security guy the cops killed thinking he was the killer.
Craig Mace-Build a wall around your wife...woof.
Has he said a word about those kids who heckled the Vietnam vet?
Build a Wall around every school in America! Thoughts and prayers at not helping!
Craig Mace-Build a wall around your wife...woof.
Elizabeth Burton Steere thoughts and prayers never was intended to be the solution. Thoughts and prayers are how people cope with tragedy. President Trump has proposed a wide range of security measures for our nation schools, but it's up to the individual School District to implement those measures including building walls around the campus.
Stephen Pierson 😂😂😂 yeah but doing something is better than doing nothing 🤓🤓🤓
#keep Mexicans out of Australia!!!
Angus Reid Beaton no haven't seen any Mexicans on the boat's
Stephen Pierson nope, He's ours for 6 more yrs.
Valerie Lynch rather you than him.

Anne Crossway vote your conscience, I sure will!
Kenneth Armstrong this rancher will give land for wall  https://www.google.com/amp/amp.fox26houston.com/news/border-rancher-ready-to-give-up-land-for-wall
Jason Terruso simple concept:  open govt, then get TAX PAYER $ (not Mexican cash like he said!) to build wall $. What a great negotiator! Fake!
Jason Terruso On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!

Next order of business, the constitution gives power to congress to make these decisions, if he just national emergency around this then who is to say any President after him wont do this and gain more and more power. Which is part if the issue now its become so normal for people to call the president the boss, but he is only the boss of one part of a three part government.
Kenneth Armstrong thanks, revolutionary insight from the fourth grade Ken. Hoping the President can find the same loopholes your liberal base uses to fund every Democratic Socialist program they think up.

Brett Beardsley  Lyin Donnie couldn’t fix a paper cut with a band aid...he’d destroy the band aid trying to get it out of its wrapper
No, it's about playing for the team not the people.  Chuck and Nancy and many more Dem reps voted for 350+mi boarder wall under Obama but can't do that now because their voter base hates Trump, with a Dem as prez they would build the wall a little at a time like they have been, but stabbing DACA in the back was 100% "playing for the team".

Glenda Mitchell Stoddard AMEN.  Leave her over there and let some other countries to put up with her poop.
Jamie Lynn Shermeyer teach your children to fight and stand up for themselves and beat the bullies ass.  Or you as a parent should step in and visit the bullies daddy and beat his dumb ass.
Bring home the military protecting Israel's borders to protect the schools. Send them a bill for exploiting the USA for their own selfish interests. Allies????
David Owens Jeffcoat typical reply by Trump lover— always insulting
Stephen Pierson you're whiney ass couldn't do it if you wanted to.
The individual school boards need to take care of their own schools!!  Local schools = local solutions!
Brian Ivinjack , What color was the nut that walked into the bank killed five women for no reason, who shot up the schools, Las Vegas, Jewish Temple, black church or did I miss something , ran over the young lady in VA, John Grady over 20 young men, Bundy, Tim Mcvey
Glenda Mitchell Stoddard AMEN.  Leave her over there and let some other countries to put up with her poop.
Mike Donovan WHAT?
William Bush what the hell are you babbling about? Are you sure you have the right post you idiot?
If schools would actually do something about the bullies in their schools, we wouldn't have half the shootings we do now. The schools claim to have zero tolerance, but when you actually report it, they claim that kids will be kids. So you want safety inside, then they need to fix their bullying policies, and start expelling all kids that have been know to bully others. This is the schools problem to fix, not Trumps.
Stephen Pierson wipe your mouth, there's still some bullshit around your lips.

You mean like EVERY other president?

Joe Calabrese when Pelosi gets over herself and does the right thing! She doesn’t and didn’t give a rat’s ass about these workers going without a paycheck when she was ready to fly off for a week!! No chance to work this mess out because she doesn’t care about anything other than getting her way! She has some grandiose idea she’s in charge 😂😂 She is the culprit in this shutdown and she is the solution!! Trump has tried to make compromises and she is blocking everything, nothing more than a careless stubborn bitch!😡

We are all victims now aren't we? We have one branch of government, the executive, the potus, refusing to pay his employees, our federal workers, to force our  other co-equal branch of government, (Nancy is the lead speaker of the house of it)!  one branch can't force the other to do things! our president has shutdown our govt, created a crisis right here, right now, trying to force his demands for 5.7 in taxpayer$ for construction funding! #OpentheGovernmentNow!

That's all that's Important we keep fighting
“Perfectly normal?” It’s perfectly insane for witnesses in or subjects of a criminal investigation to be discussing testimony.--Giuliani tells Tapper, “As far as I know, President Trump did not have discussions with [Cohen], certainly had no discussions with him in which he told him or counseled him to lie.” Then says it’s possible Trump discussed his testimony with him, “which would be perfectly normal.”
Mellissa why do you pucker your mouth like that in all your photos? Just eat a lemon? From the info on your Facebook profile it appears you have a lot of personal house cleaning to do before you come on Facebook to solve America's border issues. Also, lose the arrogance. You have done nothing to earn it, "baby"
Melissa Annmarie Davisson there is no god, you’re welcome 😊
If that is what you  believe Victor decinti
John Decker so they are legally here., That will catch up with them.
Melissa Annmarie Davisson ducking liberal pussies hat wearing fat flag flying anti American asshole snowflakes!
Melissa Annmarie Davisson. There's interest free loans available for gvmt workers. When they get their paychecks they just return it. It seems their credit score will raise too. It's been available and the gvmt workers know this.
I think it makes it so hard for victims of any kind to not be heard or feel as if they are shut out and refused options then being forced to keep living a negative experience to a certain degree..def prolongs the healing process.. I think the wall is a good idea to protect us and put limitations to  Such severe ongoing issues regarding various trafficking matters and also helping with getting other things in order with any other system in place that offers opportunity and financial benefit for people who do come and live here legally.. We also have to consider there are also victims on the other side of that wall and need to play a role in helping control those issues as well because not everyone trying to come here has Ill intentions and are just trying to seek safety just the same .. Such a huge issue and hard to find the right approach to help resolve all matters
They should ALL be Angel Families. This is BS!

Victoria A. Deobald I agree that there was more to 9/11 than we will ever know. Trump is hardly going to reinvestigate to of his backers

Brian Bray you are absolutely right. Let’s abolish the police because of a few bad apples.
That analogy does not work in this case...

Arturo Elroy Mañana lmao stop drugs and illegals is a supply and demand issue?? This is now just ridiculous! You obviously have a invested interest in not wanting this wall to help our border agents!!😳
Pat Shaw, yes drugs that Americans consume and illegals that get hired by American businesses. One more thing I’m def not against helping border patrol, I’m just saying they would probably get more benefit from better technology than a wall that would probably be jumped over or dug under... Maybe you ought to click on Larry Mitchell’s link... You’re obviously not doing your research and looking at this situation from trumps point of view and not the agents...
Arturo Elroy Mañana mhttp://dlvr.it/Qx3hxn
Arturo Elroy Mañana good point but it would be alot harder if they had to scale over a steel slated barrier..
Arturo Elroy Mañana the wall will work
Arturo Elroy Mañana Well, I remember when Clinton in fact both thought the wall and a stricter border control to keep out unwanted illegals.  I saw Obama say the same thing regarding our need for a wall and we had to curtail the influx of illegals. Now, we have someone willing and ready to get the job done but? What happened? The wall is still needed for the same reasons as Democrats wanted then, what’s changed with it being effective? Nothing!!! Except Trump is pushing for it and unless Pelosi gets her head out of her ass, it’s going to be a really tough time for a lot of federal workers! But hey, she can take another vacation she has no worries, right!! Nothing like working for your citizens that support you 🤔
Pat Shaw and why do you think it didn’t get done then?  I’m willing to bet they didn’t go with it because they figured it wouldn’t work.   The sad thing is that by trump shutting down the government it really doesn’t solve anything. The only ppl that are affected are the government employees  and not the “illegals”.
Good thing our front line border agents aren’t as dumb as you.
Wendy wendy lonely wendy 🤦🏻‍♂️ 🤔 How about the 2nd 3rd and 4th lines, you think they might be?  Had no clue there were “front lines” of border agents.  I guess just in case they get thru the front line, we have lines 2,3 and 4 huh?  🤦🏻‍♂️ The pot calling the kettle black! 🤦🏻‍♂️
Harold Meinster, is that true or did Trump tell you that?
Pat Shaw, pretty sure not only to keep illegals out.
Arturo Elroy Mañana And you think shooting women and children (and men too) is a better way to stop the illegal crossings would be better than a wall? Maybe you should rethink that.
Arturo Elroy Mañana : Leave me ask you a question.  Do you lock your doors at night?
Arturo I appreciate and respect your opinion but please think about border patrol agents at that border with no protection against hundreds of people rushing to cross! It is impossible and dangerous to not have any barrier or protection for them. You NEED some sort of deterrent and protection for those on the job
Mr. Evens even though it may look like I’m implying that illegals should be shot, I’m not. I’m just saying that there is different avenues against illegal entry verses a wall that might not even be effective hence “tunnels”.   Ed shaeffer, Leave me tell you, I do and it’s not because I only fear “illegals”.  Deb , agreed but what if they build tunnels what then?
Arturo Elroy Mañana you need some common Sense if we stop drugs and illegals from coming into America crime will go down. Fact is real border security and wall where needed would pay for itself in 2?years! If you are capable these facts are easy to find.
Tom Harver you need to take the blindfold off it’s a supply and demand issue, if Americans didn’t seek any of the things you mentioned we wouldn’t be talking about this right now. Common sense is, not always believing what you read.
Arturo Elroy Mañana oops! Didn’t get my point again!🙄 What I’m saying is, if a wall and guards around your home and family is good enough for you, what about our country and citizens!
Pat Shaw, poor thing you’re so brainwashed...
Wendy wendy lonely wendy 🤦🏻‍♂️ 🤔 How about the 2nd 3rd and 4th lines, you think they might be?  Had no clue there were “front lines” of border agents.  I guess just in case they get thru the front line, we have lines 2,3 and 4 huh?  🤦🏻‍♂️ The pot calling the kettle black! 🤦🏻‍♂️
Stephanie Wilson, exactly you used a fire arm, which solidifies my opinion.  Joyce Williams, the sweetness of owning a firearm.  Sheila Keller, until they dig a tunnel...  Chrstina Machmeyer, oh really you think so you’ve seen it yourself or did you read about it? 🤔
So to me it would make more sense to arm the border patrol with unlimited resources of sophisticated anit-intrusion equipment.
Jennifer Greene, thanks for the invitation but I’ll pass. 😉
Arturo Elroy Mañana you're a "MORON"!!
Pat Shaw, they rarely escape because of the “armed” guards go figure.  Lenny guidroz, is that all you could come up with who’s the “moron” here?
Arturo Elroy Mañana Really 🙄 You obviously didn’t read my comments or can’t comprehend!
Pat shaw, all I actually saw was wall and trump. Obviously no comprehension in all wall supporters...
Arturo Elroy Mañana why do you think Pelosi, Waters, the Clinton’s the celebrities all have walls around their homes Oh and guards?? That’s not deco !!😳
Pat Shaw, poor thing you’re so brainwashed...
Ed Schaeffer, everyone including  you is entitled to their beliefs.
We're also allowed to SHOOT intruders.  Too many liberals and bleeding hearts. Ohh just tap their hands,  say don't do that,  and let them go. What a joke.
Arturo Elroy Mañana why do you think Pelosi, Waters, the Clinton’s the celebrities all have walls around their homes Oh and guards?? That’s not deco !!😳

Linda Doiron Bailey why do you think trump didn’t get the funding for his wall while he controlled Congress for two years? Because the Republican Congress refused to fund it!!
Diane Ohlzen  BULLSHIT.
Linda Doiron Bailey oh sweetie I do believe she is third in the line of succession... Why are you so hateful?  Do you have any idea why trump didn’t get the funding for his stupid wall in the last two years when he had full control over congress?   Because they refused to fund it- so why did he wait until he lost the house- proudly proclaim on national Television that he would own the shutdown then the next day blame the Democrats?
Diane Ohlzen Well "sweetie aka bitch" The Republicans didn't get it passed because our democrat disguised as a republican majority leader, Paul Ryan didn't do his job any better than Nancy.  They passed small amounts for the wall and thats because that was all Paul Ryan put on the floor to vote on.   As for the shut down, Trump can claim it but the fact is that it is Nancy's baby.  I can claim I anything, but it doesn't make it mine.  I'm hoping the shutdown lasts until approval for boarding funding AND THE WALL has been secured.  Democrats of today are idiots.                              CLOSE THE BOARDER AND BUILD THE WALL!                                             #MAGA

Stephen Pierson, the majority of Americans voted Trump in for the Wall. Or did you forget that, or are you counting the millions of illegals as part of your "Americans"

MJ  Stark, yes I do have a job! I have a job because of President Trump! Before all the deregulation I was unemployed for a little over a year! My last employer let 130 employees go and sent our jobs straight to Mexico. President Trump addresses everything most of us were concerned about. To top things off, my wife and I make more money than we ever have. Our standard of living has improved greatly and I am 57 years old!
Don Cosner I would like to add today’s lesson: On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
Months ago, thinking that the GOP would pick up seats in the House, Trump approved $129M in funding to hire staff in the House of Rep.  He thought the funds could be used to investigate Clinton.  Democrats won and now Pelosi has this money to hire lawyers to investigate Trump!!

Bob Evans, the interest charges are already proven. Ever look at the national treasury report?
Bob Evans, we aren’t suckers. We just know we can’t endure an annual expense of 54-125 billion and not expect it to be pushed into the national debt. At some point the interest alone will sink the country
Ok man ,im not  trying  to argue  abor all of that.  . Im simply  saying  hes a douche.  You want  numbers  , i don't  have  numbers.  I am 45 and my whole life  Trump was  a dick . Now  hes president.  I can't  forget  the years  that he was a douche  . So regardless  of your  numbers  and what ever.  He was a dick  ,still is a dick  and that's  that
Whether one is liberal or conservative, the wall is just a bad idea, as the conservative sources used in this article explain.  https://medium.com/@vickyalvearshecter/what-happened-when-a-trump-supporter-challenged-me-about-the-wall-e54e86a5edd1
Bob Evans, what’s stupid is Americans haven’t yet figured out if we don’t curb our expenses, we won’t have a country very much sooner. Most likely, by 1/2020, our debt will be at 25 trillion and the annual interest alone will be close to 1/3 of a trillion

HELLO!!!!!   I never believed in Love Spells or Magics until now: When I eventually found testimonials about this spell caster baba iyamu , and how he has helped many people to get their lovers and broken homes back, i immediately contacted him through his email address: ( dr.iyamusolution@gmail. com ) because I was absolutely desperate to get my husband back. Life without my husband was a real mess for me and my child. i wanted a dramatic change and I thought magic could be the solution. After discussing the resolution with baba iyamu , he gave me hope that he will restore my marriage. I felt confident that he will actually make my husband to return home and he did! It's fantastic what this great spell caster have done for me, his help is priceless! I don't know what I would have done without baba iyamu, he does his job so well, he is organized and highly functional, i believe he is the best spell caster i can count on when it comes to all kinds of spells, his spell worked very well and fast. If you need help, contact him too, you can also reach him on Whatsapp  +380662904762

Love you idiot Northerners spewing your bs. I live here, drugs come across the border daily by human transport. You have no clue wtf you are talking about.
One of the central theses of this feed has been that Trump had a legal obligation to do nothing to aid/abet Russian cybercrimes after August 17, 2016, when he received his first classified briefing as a candidate and learned of Putin's cyberwar. Today we learned he did just that.  Today we learned that Trump was discussing unilateral sanctions relief with the Kremlin (via Sessions) *and* floating the idea of a gifted $50 million penthouse in Moscow for Putin (via Cohen and Sater) *and* negotiating a massive Trump Tower Moscow deal post-August 17, 2016. The focus of the collusion conversation has always been exclusively conspiracy. In Proof of Collusion I argued that two dozen crimes could be collusive; then, once Ben Wittes said obstruction could be collusion, everyone took note. Well aiding and abetting is *also* collusion.  Remember that what we call the Trump-Rozov deal (the 2015 Trump Tower Moscow deal, as opposed to the 2013 Trump-Agalarov deal) was being negotiated *with the Kremlin*. You *cannot* learn that Putin is in a hot cyberwar with America and keep negotiating a deal with the Kremlin.  Remember that, as of August 17, 2016, Donald Trump was one of the few civilians in the *world* with a legally cognizable level of certainty that the Kremlin was engaged in a hot cyberwar against America. His obligations from then on were therefore *special* and *justiciable*. The only reason Giuliani was willing to admit today that Trump was negotiating with the Kremlin up until Election Day is that media has so doggedly (but wrongly) said that conspiracy is the only collusion charge relevant to Mueller's probe that Trump's team came to believe it.  I think the problem that we're going to have now is that media is so invested in this grave misconception of how to use the term "collusion" in discussing Mueller's work that there's a chance the full import of what Rudy confessed to today will be missed and not reported upon.  The important thing is this: if Giuliani is willing to say this publicly, it means he's either certain Mueller already has this information from another source, or sure that information at *least* this bad about the Trump-Kremlin negotiations is certain to come out eventually. when I say "today we learned" I don't actually mean "today we learned." Readers of this feed and readers of Proof of Collusion already knew about Trump's aiding and abetting. What I mean is "today all America learned."-
Webster Lynn Vi but the wall won’t keep stop most illegal immigration- mist fly in and overstay visas. I would rather our taxpayer dollars to sorting that out than building a silly wall that people can tunnel under, cut or climb over.
Bonnie Elwood McMillin there’s 3 branches of government - seems like the recent election results in congress indicate a different point of view that also needs to be considered. Trump also said Mexico would pay for the wall- it’s a big difference to now ask the American tax payer to fund a $5 billion vanity project

Susan Diane 1. you are ten times more likely to get killed by an American white guy than an illegal immigrant. 2. No one is born here illegally. If you are born here you are a US citizen. Check the constitution. 3. There are many more American crime gangs than illegal immigrant gangs. 4. Every immigrant, even illegal ones pay sales taxes, income tax and social security. They don't get tax refunds nor are they eligible for social security benefits.
Victoria A. Deobald I thought you republicans love Israel. FYI, Israel has terrorist lobbing explosives into Israel. We don't have terrorists lobbing explosives over the boarder. That is a piss poor argument.
We need protection from morons like this ^^^^^ >:(
Because it doesn't.

Nancy refuses to meet with ANGEL PARENTS! THAT WALL WILL GET BUILT ONEWAY OR ANOTHER! MAGA!!!
You said Mexico will pay for it. Now you shut down the government you lied.
Because of the actual ways they are getting in. Not everyone travels 80 miles through desert and very rough terrain heading to where you don't know.
Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Mike J Knifong Not only are you arguing against what Mexico states, but you are also arguing against your own narrative  sorry peanut you can't have it both ways😂 walls paid for https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/247649-no-mr-trump-mexico-is-not-killing-us-on-trade?fbclid=IwAR3syMh1o2pB7MPNxm0Q3B27WoPNcer5S5galT_g2KqqrCckujfoz3IVzb4

Amy Patrick about 2 weeks ago Howdy. To recap: I’m a licensed structural and civil engineer with a MS in structural engineering from the top program in the nation and over a decade of experience on high-performance projects, and particularly of cleaning up design disasters where the factors weren’t properly accounted for, and I’m an adjunct professor of structural analysis and design at UH-Downtown. I have previously been deposed as an expert witness in matters regarding proper construction of walls and the various factors associated therein, and my testimony has passed Daubert. Am I a wall expert? I am. I am literally a court-accepted expert on walls. Structurally and civil engineering-wise, the border wall is not a feasible project. Trump did not hire engineers to design the thing. He solicited bids from contractors, not engineers. This means it’s not been designed by professionals. It’s a disaster of numerous types waiting to happen. What disasters? Off the top of my head... 1) It will mess with our ability to drain land in flash flooding. Anything impeding the ability of water to get where it needs to go (doesn’t matter if there are holes in the wall or whatever) is going to dramatically increase the risk of flooding. 2) Messes with all kind of stuff ecologically. For all other projects, we have to do an Environmental Site Assessment, which is arduous. They’re either planning to circumvent all this, or they haven’t accounted for it yet, because that’s part of the design process, and this thing hasn’t been designed. 3) The prototypes they came up with are nearly impossible to build or don’t actually do the job. This article explains more: https://www.google.com/…/mobile.engineering.…/amp/17599.html And so on. The estimates provided for the cost are arrived at unreasonably. You can look for yourself at the two-year-old estimate that you see everyone citing. http://fronterasdesk.org/…/Bernstein-%20The%20Trump%20Wall.… It does not account for rework, complexities beyond the prototype design, factors to prevent flood and environmental hazard creation, engineering redesign... It’s going to be higher than $50bn. The contractors will hit the government with near CONSTANT change orders. “Cost overrun” will be the name of the game. It will not be completed in Trump’s lifetime. I’m a structural forensicist, which means I’m called in when things go wrong. This is a project that WILL go wrong. When projects go wrong, the original estimates are just *obliterated*. And when that happens, good luck getting it fixed, because there aren’t that many forensicists out there to right the ship, particularly not that are willing to work on a border wall project— a large quotient of us are immigrants, and besides, we can’t afford to bid on jobs that are this political. We’re small firms, and we’re already busy, and we don’t gamble our reputations on political footballs. So you’d end up with a revolving door of contractors making a giant, uncoordinated muddle of things, and it’d generally be a mess. Good money after bad. The GAO agrees with me. And it won’t be effective. I could, right now, purchase a 32 foot extension ladder and weld a cheap custom saddle for the top of the proposed wall so that I can get over it. I don’t know who they talked to about the wall design and its efficacy, but it sure as heck wasn’t anybody with any engineering imagination. Another thing: we are not far from the day where inexpensive drones will be able to pick up and carry someone. This will happen in the next ten years, and it’s folly to think that the coyotes who ferry people over the border won’t purchase or create them. They’re low enough, quiet enough, and small enough to quickly zip people over any wall we could build undetected with our current monitoring setup. Let’s have border security, by all means, but let’s be smart about it. This is not smart. It’s not effective. It’s NOT cheap. The returns will be diminishing as technology advances, too. This is a ridiculous idea that will never be successfully executed and, as such, would be a monumental waste of money. 🤷🏻‍♀️ This is set to public. Have a blast sharing it.

Bill Briggs,  I agree with you,Nancy doesn't want to give in with the president, then emergency order, close the borders off,  Nancy is the speaker , not the president
Todd Cuson   That's a different problem with a different solution. Fact is, people cross the border illegally where no wall or barrier exists. It needs to stop completely NO more.

Finally we have a President, from the business community, who is standing up to Career Politicians. The waste, fraud and misuse of American Taxpayers hard earner tax dollars has go to stop. President Trump is doing a Great Job, I hope he keeps up the good work he is doing !!!  I fully support him !

Robin Waché did you ever even think about a southern border wall before trump told you to?
I support you Mr. President! I was informed California Democrats love illegal immigrants so they can give free benefits with voting rights to be Democrat so Democrats in office can continue holding power. Desperate and underhanded. I am a 3rd generation Californian and my mom just retired at 75 because she could not afford to sooner.

You know and I  know that as soon as government workers go back to work they will get BACK PAY for all the money that is due.....Why not get the Treasury Dept to give all of the employees short term loans at no interest until the shut down is fixed....Why NOT????

Whose going to pay for the wall?  https://www.facebook.com/1087167058116488/posts/1188671814632678?sfns=cl  Trump lied....over and over and over again.  When he said,”I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,” he wasn’t calling you loyal; he was calling you STUPID.

I have never seen a President so committed to America's SAFETY and GREATNESS Like President Donald J. Trump.

Norene Boone , it all there fault except  trump hes only  been there for two yrs. Most Congress  been there for ever and have done nothing but talk about border security
Leatha Gross why? Did you ever even think about a southern border wall before trump told you to?
BJ Russell why? What will the wall do? Will it protect you? What about the northern boarder? Do you want a wall from east to west?
Norene Boone that’s when you drop tear gas in the tunnels then shoot when thay run out problem solved

BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Norene Boone you are delusional
Aaron Nuss as many as trump reversing them
Norene Boone aren't those bills without the wall? I don't know about everyone, but I think we need the wall.
Norene Boone He didn’t really have a majority. He didn’t have all the Republicans either. It takes 60 % in the Senate to pass bills. He is fighting a group in Congress who want and like the way things are. They don’t want change like some people want. They want power and money. Even term limits may not stop it and most if not all of them would never vote for term limits. Call it what you want, but we have a stalemate. And we are getting nothing of value to us and or the country.  The only things we have gotten in the last two years came from Executive Order. I for one do not want a dictatorship where one person rules. I like what we should have and I think it’s worth fighting for.
Obamacare did NOT pass like that .https://www.dailysignal.com/2010/03/16/obamacare-slaughter-rule-is-without-precedent/

Sharon Samuels. Really? Hate crime is up 75% since Trump took office. His followers have shot up newspapers, churches, concerts and synagogues. They've been caught planning terrorist acts and some have actually bombed a Mosque or two. There was the inept MAGABOMBER endangering the lives of postal workers, secret service and elected officials. There was and still are nazis freely walking the streets and terrorizing innocent Americans not to mention the nazis in Charlottesville that killed an American. But, your leader called them fine people.   Maybe if you keep to Nazi rallies and klan meetings, you'll feel safer.

Chammy Ney Ney Jr.   Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S. Constituents, if you ‘like’ this, like it whenever you see it.   https://m.facebook.com/The-Great-1461-Day-Adventure-360025854356893/

President Trump keeps his promises.... remember Drain the Swamp? It’s happening. The sucking sound is beginning.... Love it!

DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old.

The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9.

With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21. The FTC's identity theft reporting system is shut down. 22. Student loans are being delayed as universities are unable to verify parents' income with the IRS 23. Small Business Administration loans have been delayed. 24. Domestic violence shelters that receive federal funds have been forced to cut services. 25. Highway and transit projects are being delayed or canceled. 26. Wildfire preparations in western states are delayed. 27. The National Hurricane Center's research has been delayed 28. The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo are closed. 29. Funding for Section 8 housing assistance has lapsed, placing low-income families at risk of eviction. 30. Civil cases in federal court have been delayed. Lawsuits against Donald Trump in federal court are on hold.
As soon as the Dems took the house, he called it an Emergency  ..lol  The house and the senate agreed on a budget  deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!   The Trump administration tried to dismantle DACA, that shields approximately 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation, in the fall of 2017, but a prolonged court battle has kept the initiative alive. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also announced the eventual termination of TPS protections for more than 250,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Honduras, Sudan and Haiti, but a federal judge blocked the decision in early October.  Now he says he’ll give a temporary stay for them, something he took away.. for his 5.7 none border he PROMISED and GARENTEEED ! Mexico would pay for... lol … yes more barriers where immigration says it needs, not 5.7 billion for his dumb wall, MAJOIRTY of drugs come in cars at ports of entry, FACT!

Chammy Ney Ney Jr. , Do you even have opposable thumbs?
Jeff Tucker  Trump is waiting on "Dims" to fund a bill they voted for😂
Joseph R Phipps first off he's not "my boy." I don't blindly support politicians like you Trumpers do. I criticized Obama plenty.  Russia is interfering in our elections as we speak. They have even hacked into our electrical grids ECT. So I don't know if Putin has a tape of Trump peeing on underage hookers or what. Russia is not our ally.  Sorry but Mueller is VERY busy with Trumps crimes. Is it even possible for you to debate without bringing up past presidents? Who by the way aren't under investigation.
Sonja Sherrod Dims" ideology  enforcing laws threatens a one term🤡  Gee what law would that be...Secure fence Act  what is the "Dims" job by law - fund it  what are "Dims" not doing - following the law  DERP
John Bentley DNC emails described their voters as "functional illiterates" the codified it by saying: "in order to achieve consistency, the voter must be kept ignorant" You like to think of yourself as the bright ones  Wanna tackle that?🤡

Sonja Sherrod “The Obama administration said on Friday that despite Russian attempts to undermine the presidential election, it has concluded that the results accurately reflect the will of the American people.”  Trump is your President 😎

Sonja Sherrod So which is it? O was lying then or "Dims" are lying now 🤡 Mr. Trump raised concerns pursuant to the election being rigged, Obama lashed out at him. In October, literally only days before the election, speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Obama swung at Mr. Trump, saying: “This is just more than the usual standard lie. That is not a joking matter. That is dangerous because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in other people’s minds about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy.” It’s worth noting that America is not a democracy, but I digress.🤡  "Dims" spent the next two years blaming Russia hacked the election🤡
Sonja Sherrod  I found a copy of your platform🤡 http://hardcorezen1.dogensanghalosan.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/schultz-300x225.jpg?fbclid=IwAR1Ryh6XeViZtKH862kjjkO7R1BJ1MiKK0-T9eywzTLIZCjtrvqC60VSduQ

Chammy Ney Ney Jr. actually he’s the worst. 🤣😂🤣
Joseph R Phipps he did bring him up at the very beginning. And he had every right to as Bush left us in one of our worst recessions in history. 2 years in and Trump continues to talk about Obama and even Hillary who lost the election. He's a whiny little bitch.
James Assinhand just calm down and push your Russian reset button🤡
More Americans pessimistic about Trump's presidency than any presidency in last 25 years  His strongly disapprove rating in the Marist poll, at 45% this week, tied his previous all-time high for that pollster. By the Quinnipiac University poll's reading, his strongly disapprove rating stands at 50%. These are very high strong disapproval ratings. Trump is as strongly disliked now as President Richard Nixon was when he resigned in 1974.  CNN
Joseph R Phipps a reset button is better than being Putin's puppet! Don't you think? Putin is enjoying every minute with Trump as president.  He's drinking vodka with his buddies like "I so own this guy!!"
Joseph R Phipps I never said it wasn't.
Sonja Sherrod  You know what "Dims" are not working on🤡 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdown-coastguard-idUSKCN1P924S?fbclid=IwAR2EMoXrXEGVzMRFU7aORc3Lm8bFKJxEgvnxDPQ-xh-AM3xbSQR4aEjkgkE
Joseph R Phipps oh god don't even start. Obama is gone now. And all you people do is deflect to him and Hillary. Its getting old and sad.  Do you even have a clue what Trump is doing to the environment. Maybe ask a family that lives near a structure that is back polluting again because of him.  Obama did not have the longest job loss streak ever. You sound like Trump just spouting nonsense. Its pathetic.
Sonja Sherrod You must have been the slow one in special needs class😂

Kelly Cross Sr Jr Senator "O" first pushed to disarmed Ukraine #2 guy FBI says Russia interfered in 08-12 elections 08 Georgia/Russia conflict O doesn't want US involvement O pushes Facebook and Google to build a silicon valley in Moscow for Putin's military intelligence complex O tells Putin he'll be more flexible after the election O removes missile defense systems Putin didn't like O lets Putin move into Syria After telling Ukraine we would protect them O lets Russia invade O covers for Putin/Russia election interference until late 2016  Looks like your "Boy" was working with the enemy of America 🤡
He did all he could to roll back regulations that protect companies from polluting and screwing up the environment. I guess that's how he is creating jobs.

Joseph R Phipps hold up Repuppet👺 Those failures belong to the trumpster lol... Where are all these great numbers Trump proclaimed? No one ever sees them but him
I guess you don't read too many books?
Joseph R Phipps people don't claim that. He did inherit a good economy but look what he's doing to it. Mr. Man of the People giving bigly tax breaks to the ultra wealthy. Now he's costing us billions with his stupid distraction shut down. He's adding astronomical debt. Didn't he promise to eliminate the debt? Oh right...he's a liar. Trump will most likely leave us in a recession. Too bad we won't have Obama to get us out of it.

James Assinhand CFO of DuMass ink🤡😂
Chammy Ney Ney Jr.  amen
James Assinhand Hey I got a question How many drug traffickers make it through non-ports of entry undetected with their drugs to substantiate the claim "a majority of drug trafficking is done through legal ports of entry"🤡
Joseph R Phipps none
Roy Talley  He said he never had to work🤡  James Ahssanipoor I was wondering who eddie was lol  9w  Mario Quintanilla James Ahssanipoor haha our old boss  9w
James Assinhand  your next trade is at the Game stop🤡  Go get-um killer
I've read every one of them. ALL that I asked for is for you to say I voted for....   Because...... But I guess that's just too difficult for a CFO that says they NEVER work. It actually requires a minimum amount of WORK. Really not difficult. You're just not willing to answer the question because I'll make you look stupid.  Too late pal. By NOT answering. You already do.  Just sayin.....
See.....all I want is a VERY simple comment. Just a couple of sentences.   I voted for....  because...   How hard can that be for a CFO?
Chammy Ney Ney Jr.  shut yo dumbass up
James Ahssanipoor How your girlfriend...I mean goat🤡
Sonja Sherrod You love the orange man😂

James Assinhand sponging off your dada don't make you work jack🤡
James Ahssanipoor  STILL circling the airport. You said who cares about Hillary. That's something we agree on. I didn't want her back in the white house either. That's why I voted for Trump. So I'm gonna ask another time. Who did you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? It's such a simple question. How come you're not willing to answer the question? A smart CFO like yourself shouldn't have a bit of problem coming up with a very quick answer. How come it's taking so long....you never answered my question?
Chammy Ney Ney Jr.  Trump 2020  가아즈~~^^

James Ahssanipoor Your sister😂
James Ahssanipoor  I was talking about Hillary Clinton's records that were stored on a private server in her basement. Try to keep up. You're a CFO. You should pay more attention to detail... You know...the ones that were on all those smashed e-mail servers? But we all know those 33,000 deleted e-mails that would incriminate her was only an accident.  I mean..... that kind of stuff is ALWAYS happening to folks. Right? Geeeeezzzzzaloo.. to be CFO and NEVER work, you sure come up with some goofball comments! Just sayin....
James Ahssanipoor I mean Assinhand😂

Chammy Ney Ney Jr. What rock are you living under.  This guy is a con man.  Wake up.
Ron Saia  https://www.facebook.com/IJRRed/videos/2127951264121255/
James Ahssanipoor Lili says you're a doofus that works by the hour
James Ahssanipoor  When are you going to stop circling the airport and land the plane? I've asked you a VERY simple question 3 times. I'll ask it again. Who did you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? Your CFO of your company. Surely it ain't gonna be that hard for you to answer. So stop sidestepping it. Ya want to stop circling the airport and bring it in for a landing? Who'd you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why?
James Assinhand the protector of Hillzy🤡
Todd Cuson  Yep..... He's stationed at a military base there. Nice try though.
Todd Cuson however you mean it, I'm in Nigeria for now but I've always been follower of PRESIDENT DJT.... and he's obviously MAGA!!
James Ahssanipoor  How come you never answered my question in my comment. It's such a simple question. Stop sidestepping it. Who'd ya vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? Did you like where this country was heading? Men using the bathroom with your wife and daughter? Which Obama accomplishments do you consider to be his best?  I'm curious. Hillary would have continued down the same roads, but I'll ask the question again. Who'd ya vote for and why? Surely you have a reason?

Tom Kizlaitis  Hillary Clinton gave Putin 20% of our Uranium reserves in exchange for a donation to her private foundation who's records are stored on a private server in her basement. That's why Putin is clapping. You know that. Right?
James Ahssanipoor minimum wage James trying to get in on the grownups conversation
Keith Webber Jr. yes - please, you and I cannot be the only ones that see it
James Ahssanipoor lies again? why? is it impossible for the truth from the left? seems not.
Chammy Ney Ney Jr. Your in Nigeria, how wonderfully knowledgeable you are about OUR president.
Donald, a thrice-married cheat, has a credibility problem. He asked for $1.6 billion, appropriations committee said "OK", then he said nevermind make it $5 billion, House said "OK", then he said actually $5.7 billion PLUS let's shutdown the government, and he struck no deals until the opposing party took the House away January 3. YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH LIARS.  So forget Donald, he is just fooling around. He's changed the terms before and he'll do it again, so just bypass him with a veto-proof majority.  Why? Because air traffic controllers. Because ICE. Because US Coast Guard. Because TSA. Because America is open for business, even if president bone spur isn't.  Veto-proof majority, just bypass the useless lying cheating bone spur.
Chammy Ney Ney Jr.  the best ever idiot, if u do not believe. Please google
Keith Webber Jr. U can say that again man
James Ahssanipoor lies again? why? is it impossible for the truth from the left? seems not.
Sorry Chammy Ney Ney Jr..  I tagged the wrong peson...This question is intended for James Ahssanipoor. So here it is ole buddy.   James thinks Hillary Clinton did NOT have textual relations with that server.  I mean........ anyone could accidentally delete 33,000 e-mails that would incriminate them. Right? He wants Hillary Clinton back in the white house with Bill Clinton by her side. That way Bill coud have wild passionate monkey love in the oval office on TAXPAYER'S money. Hey James. .. Did you know that Monica Lewinsky had a birthday recently? She's in her 50's now. It seams like only yesterday that she was crawling around the white house floor putting anything she could find in her mouth. They grow up so quickly these days. Don't ya think so James? Hillary Clinton will screw over America in a Benghazi minute.... but just answer this question James.... If you didn't vote for Trump,  who'd ya vote for and why? That's a VERY simple question. A simple answer will do just fine.
James Ahssanipoor i'mma give Stephen Johnson first for having nothing!!😂😂😂

Dean Clouse WHAT?
Dean Clouse what on God's green earth has this Russian spy done for America? Oh right! A Yuuuge tax cut for his billionaire buddies and CEO friends..have you seen the deficit since he took office? You know 200 indictments ago...The U.S. Treasury reported that October’s deficit was $100 billion, an increase of $37 billion or 58% from a year ago. While one month may not be a trend, it puts the full-year deficit on a path from $779 billion in fiscal 2018 to $1 trillion in fiscal 2019. He's a business genius? lol suckers!
Dean Clouse if you would kindly do your research you will find that the terms have been talked about for years. Spoke about when Reps held the House. Old news. BTW doesn't matter anymore anyway. Just like Chump being Pres. It don't matter anymore coz here we are dealing with both of them.
When it is made an ultimatum to get votes for Pelosi, that’s a bit different.
Dean Clouse point
Steve Tash lmao, what an argument. Obama increased national deficit $10 trillion, more than every other president combined. And Russian spy? That will remain the most ignorant crap being spewed by democrats until Trump is done. When I have thousands extra back on tax returns, I don’t give a crap if CEOs are getting tax breaks. Newsflash by the way, when large companies get tax breaks they invest more in workers, create new products, open new facilities, etc. That’s good for Americans. Stop spouting crap from the left wing media.

Drain the swamp,
Charles Sneckenberg it’s so much about political parties and not about coming to an agreement. They all need to leave it at the end of the day and drink it out, shakehands and play nice together.
Dean Clouse point
The Bill of Rights lists ten specific Human Rights, which are “inalienable” and “endowed by our Creator”, such that no government can grant Rights, or take them away.  According to the Constitution of the Unites States, these Rights “shall not be violated” and “shall not be infringed”.  In fact, “Congress shall make no law to abridge” them.    Each of these Ten Rights is delineated below.  Parenthetically, current examples of a legislative code, act or agency which has since abridged each Right, follows.  There are too many examples of Abridged Rights to list, so only a couple are provided for each.  Read the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations for a full list!  All Ten Rights under the Bill of Rights are now abridged, revoked or restricted.  Having also legislatively erased the Separation of Powers, and the Definition of Free People; the U.S. Constitution is consequently null and void; and no law, act, or code, is legally enforceable.  The U.S. Government currently operates without any constitutional authority, just like every other oligarchical organized crime syndicate, and You Simply Have No Rights.  We can’t even use their own laws against them, because they exempted themselves from virtually every law they’ve written.  In other words, it was a bait and switch from day one, and we are still falling for it.    1.	Freedom of Religion, both the establishment and practice thereof. (IRC Section 501(c)(3); 98 US 145; 494 US 872; 374 US 398) 2.	Freedom of Speech, Press and all forms of Expression. (Federal Communications Commission, 413 US 15; 484 US 260; 509 F. 2d 1133) 3.	Freedom to Peaceably Assemble and Protest the Government. (HB 347; 491 US 147, 150-51; 534 US 316, 322; 312 US 569, 575-76) 4.	Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms. (107 Stat. 1536; 307 US 174; 48 Stat. 1236; 350 Fed. Appx. 874; 701 F. 3d 81) 5.	No Soldier shall be Quartered in any House without Consent of the Owner. (National Defense Authorization Act requires taxpayers to fund all housing of soldiers whether they agree with the taxes and use of the militia or not.) 6.	Freedom to be Secure in your Persons, Houses, Papers, and Effects; Against Unreasonable Searches and Seizures. (The Patriot Act, the National Security Administration.) 7.	No Person Shall be Held to Answer for a Capital, or otherwise Infamous Crime, unless on a Presentment or Indictment of a Grand Jury.

I have a question: The Wall has to do with National Security, right? Do ALL matters of 'national security' have to be approved by Congress? I do NOT know how everything works, & I do not know exactly what the Constitution says about this, but it seems to me that, IF a thing is a matter of National Security, the decisions would be made directly by Homeland Security & maybe those in the Pentagon, military leaders & such. Don't they have a budget that is to be used for whatever they need to secure the United States? WHY does it have to be approved by the Legislative branch???***  Since protecting the country & the citizens in it, is one of the primary things that the fed.gov. Is SUPPOSED to do....The Wall isn't anything NEW; it is simply something that HAS been approved of before, but was not acted upon. WHY does it have to be approved again? SERIOUSLY WANTING TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS!* Thanks!*                                                 (( HOW did obama sneak that huge amount of money, cash, without us knowing it? AND, IF Schumer made a proposal for 25 billion for a 'border fence' & border security in 2013, then was that money used up? & if not, where did it go & why isn't IT being used? AND, there certainly hasn't been 700 miles of fencing or wall built, probably EVER!  We've seen pictures. Pathetic.(I read Politifact; it said that that proposal didn't get picked up by the House after it went thru the Senate in 2013) AND, when the left speaks of a 'fence'...hahaha....EVERYONE KNOWS  a fence won't keep out those wanting to climb & dig under a fence, OUT. A 'fence' is a joke, & it's just to pacify.  Pelosi says that to have a 'wall',is not what our country(ok, nancy....EXPLAIN...what is our country???) .....Well, I SAY, OUR GREAT COUNTRY IS NOT A DOORMAT!****AND, we're not into SLOPPY UN-DISCIPLINED OPERATIONS.*To just allow anyone to come & trample on it's land, laws or principles, & try to take over.....just so the oldies in the congress can have dem votes.....now THAT'S Pathetic.....You know what??? Hahahaha! IF the DACA people get to stay, after they get really situated & become citizens, I bet they'll ALL VOTE REPUBLICAN!* Cause they will have seen enough of the dem confusion & chaos.I bet California WILL go Red! Cause when things get so bad, people revolt....& the chaos is coming from the left, not the right. I don't know, but maybe by then, there'll be a Nationalist party or a stronger Libertarian Party, etc. & maybe dems will change their name to 'socialist party'. >>Draining the swamp-----WWG1WGA 👍🇺🇸
Charles Sneckenberg it’s so much about political parties and not about coming to an agreement. They all need to leave it at the end of the day and drink it out, shakehands and play nice together.
Why stop at the southern border. Completely confine the USA  with a total wall. Make it an island.
Lori Godines so your saying people who have worked for their money can’t do what they want with it.   That is so un-American!   Lori I to believe you shouldn’t be able to cross our border at will.  I believe in border  security.  This Moron we have as a president has chosen to go about things that get people like you who are ignorant to the facts to act out like you just have.  And that is truly the problem!   Illegal immigration is a problem that is easily solved.  Make it a felony to hire anyone who isn’t here legally and illegal immigration would be solved over night.   Why isn’t this done ?   Our country would come to a screeching halt.  You may find this hard to believe, especially with your extra chromosome and all, but why isn’t it a crime to hire an illegal immigrant !!  Our food supply depends on migrant workers.   Sensible and comprehensive immigration reform is needed!   Trumps a moron and his days are numbered, so it won’t happen under his administration!

There is one reason Travis that Pelosi is in a high position and that's money.  Pelosi represents a very rich district and she is the best fundraiser in the Democratic party.  She makes the Democrats a ton of money so they keep her around.

How many people do you think Pelosi will allow on her property, we see set-ins when things are not right and I believe it is time the American people take the problem to Pelosi home and see how she wants to protect it.

Border wall and border security definitely provides protection, but if the wall is not built then foreign aid to build nations to prevent war and a recession would be affected. United States generous foreign aid to nations is vital to prevent a world war and economic disaster due to climate change
Our immigration system is not broken. Enforcement of the law is what is broken. Broken by a government the is actively not supporting the security of our sovereign nation and working to created a one world government with no borders.

I was tboned by a illegal alien in Philadelphia. I can barely walk. Forth surgery on the way. I am a single parent, sole support, and private contractor. I lost months of work and barely making it !
This meme pretty much says it all if you think about it.  Sadly it only tells half of the story. https://www.facebook.com/theamericankidtimfazenbaker/photos/a.616705838701461/745512385820805/?type=3&theaterAmerica First - Tim Faze
and in case FB is censoring it (its only showing a link which you may not "click on"--> it says 800,000 federal workers are not getting paid but 20 million non-citizens are so build the wall is essentially what the meme says.
btw : MAGA.  President Trump puts together an honest effort to cooperate and end the shut-down amid an environment of absolutely tragic immaturity and lies.. the scary thing is : time is still ticking and running out.  There aren't too many more "Trumps" out there.  THANK GOD TRUMP HAS GREAT KIDS! ( and I am looking 20 to 30 years into the future here)
MAGA!!!!
also the new Driver License rules are kind of "Draconian" the levels of proof of residence that you have to go through or else you can't take a commercial flight or set foot on federal land.. As a US Citizen who is a direct descendant of the original founders, I can tell you that I am having to face a massive headache for the first time JUST to have a compliant ID card on my drivers license.  This is draconian and it is caused by the fact that we probably have a large double digit percentage of non-citizens roaming around within our borders.  THIS IS A SEVERE PROBLEM!

So Pelosi states "NO" prior to the speech. She and her group want the Gov't opened, then they will proceed to "talk". Let's see now: You loan me $500,000 now, and later we will "talk" & I will agree to sign the Contract, well maybe and maybe NOT. Hilarious ! Or is there a problem with what sits above the neck on the LEFT ? That is an assumption that others are as dumb as you are.
Yes, remember when Pelosi said we have to pass the Obamacare bill to be able to see what's in it.
Lenny Anders yes, and it was not even read by her or the others.humm. We see the hypocrisy here daily.

....I'm sorry you find it amusing, Dan.... Are you aware of how many millions of dollars a day the illegals are costing us...? And now - all the families in crisis because of the shutdown and our President has agreed to a compromise and Nancy Pelosi isn't open to negotiating....? I am almost ashamed to be an American...
my son is a father of 4 in Utah and he gets extremely discouraged at all the Mexicans there - filling their shopping carts with food that he has never been able to buy for his family, crab legs, steak, etc.... Nothing against Mexicans, you understand - just discouraged with our broken system.... I hope this helps shed some light on the reality of things ~
Build the wall, it's been needed for decades and the politicians, both sides have failed us. We need the wall and it is proven that it works!!!

Sharon, they had to use it to provide for all the illegals that came in.  Annual cost of illegal immigration: OVER $84 BILLION. Yet Democrats will NOT spend 5 BILLION to keep Americans safe & stop drugs. Wake up Taxpayers! #BuildTheWall 🇺🇸
Whose going to pay for the wall?  https://www.facebook.com/1087167058116488/posts/1188671814632678?sfns=cl  Trump lied....over and over and over again.

Mr. President, I have bone spurs on my feet and I served in the Army😁. I guess besides that we really don't have much in common. Do we😁? I mean you didn't serve because you have bone spurs too. I wish I would of known I would have assured with much confidence. You could've served too😁.
Fix it all by booting out the Alzheimer patient and Shucky .....then gasoline down the tunnels with fire and a mine field around the boarder......or a gun range at the boarder.... Americans can have free live and moving Target's to practice on.

You can clearly see how the POTUS cares for the security of the United States. Just look at the extreme he goes to make certain the American people are safe. He has the big picture, we just have street view. Let him continue being president.

I want the wall now speaker Pilosi  now, ,
Larry Cavanaugh, I cant agree more about the insincerity of politicians who also take great care to ensure they say as little as possible.   We talk about term limits, but for now I’d be happy if we could at least limit the terms they use.   The ironic thing is Trump is actually trying to work toward a solution while Pelosi and Schumer only seek to obstruct. Maybe Trump isn’t the bigger problem here?
Bob Segal Term limits for congress is needed badly. Too much power is obtained as time accumulates and all those bastards re self serving. Also, I'm not even slightly convinced building that wall is going to change much of anything. Its another band aid that fails to address the source of the problems that cause people to want to leave central America and come here. There are other ways to approach this but nobody ever mentions them.

Ulrike Hoffmann-Tanner that's what they wanted him to do so they could of used unconstitutional laws they created in 1878 just 13 years after they had our 16th president killed and their only regret is they didn't do it 28 years sooner so we would of had a different 16th president.

When is Obama going to be held accountable for interfering with President Trump's administration? You know Pelosi met with him in Hawaii right? I have heard tale that the rest of the Democratic party in Puerto Rico met with the Soros group there. In my opinion this "little trip" she planned was her way of being gone while Obama and Soros things tried something.
Agree, it will be interesting to see how many Democrats will be missing from the SOTU because they have been indicted.

See there you go again, showing your intelligence. You have nothing to say or add so you revert to name calling. Not that it matters but I'm not a liberal. Doesn't matter what party I associate with. I as you are am an American and Patriot. I have and will vote outside my choise of party period.
Better start using spell check if you want run your mouth
Lolol. See what I mean, sorry I'm not perfect like you. Nothing of value to add so we go for the... That's ok though.

Your out alright out of your mind
Thank you Mr. President for all you do for us.  The letter Nancy wrote to you uninviting you for the State of the Union, should you decide the wall is a crisis, proves Nancy thinks it's a crisis too. All the proof you need! She drew that conclusion without even conferring with Homeland security and other top officials!
Your out alright out of your mind
Communist are the real problem. THey have no socialist agenda. Marx was a cousin to the Rothchillds bankers. He likes to frame the capitalists for the greed of the real 1% whom are not white corporate men.

So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one.                                                                                                  Ezekiel 22:30.
Hello Victoria, funny thing, in the bible we learn that the Jewish people are a chosen people by God for God, and us Gentiles are actually favored in some ways the Jewish people struggle to see, in any event, in these end times we gentiles, look to the Jewish nation for signs of the times, the End times, preparing to be with our Lord in the air,  Great book, Wonderful God! ;-)

Janece McClain amen!
Why are we letting Pelosi rule this country? She is not President and yet she is saying no to things the Democrats would like to compromise on and get this country moving again. She needs to resign due to selfish, over bearing, mental problems that we can all see in her. She is overstaying her mental ability to be worth a nickel. I am ashamed of her and I am not a Democrat.
one branch of our government can not force another branch! It's at the heart of our democracy! He can not force this construction project funding! no president is all powerful! He can Open the Government and haggle construction funding later! Ya know, so his employees can get out of the food lines, he can stop racking up shutdown costs over 4.6, putting airline travel in jeopardy...

You know I just dont understand. President Trump was voted into the office of President by the people of the United States, that should be the end of it. He was voted in and is trying to do what is best for those (us) people. So let him, if you didn't like what he stood for you shouldn't of voted for him. Last time I checked to win the Presidency you have to have the most votes. So I would think the majority of people who voted think he knows what he doing, right? Then let him do it.
Be an American President for American's, don't back down.
No  more  delaying  build  the  wall  now
Connie Ramos My house hold does not want the wall as is written. We want Border Security. And happy to agree with you on who works for who! Well said!

Do you make this crap up? Pluck mystery numbers and so called facts from thin air? He's wank
I think all of our Congress has been vacinated with a phonograph needle.  By the time they have all stopped talking at the same time, we will have lost our Freedom and will be a Third World Nation of losers. Remember God gave us two ears and one mouth. We should listen twice as much as we talk.   Everyone loves a Winner!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 USA!

Just STOP ALL Mexico and S. American aid because we are clearly wasting that money and for what really?  Declare a Nat’l Emergency, Shut the Border and #BuildTheDamnWallAndThrowTheStupidOverIt!  Use the foreign aid money we would be sending to them to build the wall mile by mile until it’s done!

“He is shutting down the government to break his signature campaign promise. His signature campaign promise was that the taxpayers weren’t going to have to pay for it.” The House Armed Services Committee Chairman said on “This Week.”
Anyone know about how much it costs to support illegals we have right now for a year?
Whose going to pay for the wall?  https://www.facebook.com/1087167058116488/posts/1188671814632678?sfns=cl  Trump lied....over and over and over again.  When he said,”I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,” he wasn’t calling you loyal; he was calling you STUPID.
It is normal, democratic, American politics for the executive and legislative branches of government to bargain & negotiate over competing policy preferences. It is not normal, democratic, or American for the paychecks of workers to be held hostage while doing so.
Ottavio Esquivel... you are on the wrong page here go post to your own president in Costa Rica!
Tunde Lakatos 1) i have the right to post to The President of USA cuz i am also US Citizen.  2) costa rica and USA has exactly the same issue with immigration. This country has people from Nicaragua, Colombia and Venezuela immigrating to CR as illegals. So i Understand Trumps position of immigration. 3) I have a good point to ask something that he promise in campaign.

Stand strong Mr. President.  The Democrats are lying as they always do.  Don’t open the government until AFTER the wall is funded.  Thank you and God bless you sir.  Have a great day.  ❤️🇺🇸❤️
I think the President should declare by executive order that there will be no pay for any member of Congress until the Border Crisis is settled!!
Told her a couple of times already, but her voice mail box is full now, and she's not taking any more calls.
The Republican Congress made the same commitment for non-stop border wall funding for 2018 and 2019 of $1.3 billion each year.  Trump vetoed the Senate 100-0 vote in 2019.
Carlos Andres Espitia Garzon way to much Covfefe please slow down your manifesting delusional behavior !

same promise you made to all the children you have in your border prisons???
Thank you President Trump for try to save this Nation.
Thank you POTUS for living up to your campaign promises. May God be with you
Giving amnesty  to  illegals  is  NOT  going  to  make  our  country  safer.
Americans need JFK not FDR. FDR a commie
Sorry, Lara. I can't see your face and not think of the horrible misleading media about racing greyhounds that you've been a part of. HSUS and grey2k are nothing but FAKE NEWS and you deserve to be a part of the truth, not their false agenda. Find some greyhound people and discover the truth
She knows she can’t tell the truth
Each refugees costs tax payers $82k per year. Democrats vote harvest
Holding American Citizens HOSTAGE is NOT the American Way. Trump needs to end the Humanitarian Crisis HE CREATED in This Country and OPEN the Government NOW!
No No Nancy is letting drugs flow across the non existent safe border. Time to tell her That’s a no no!
amen If Pelosi refuses to build wall,Impeach her and get the military to do it. I understand that another caravan is coming and 2 more behind this one is planned. Soon we will have to open a concentration camp for any who invade us...we must! Or collapse as a country
He want to make everybody live without fear is a peace keeping  leader.
Great President Illegal is Wrong..
1 hr ·  "They have aligned themselves with the only viable strategy left: encourage illegal entry.  Get as many on amnesty and social assistance as possible as fast as you can, and begin systematically mining them for power.  Meanwhile the Census records the number of people living in each county, which is how representation is scored. This is what many people don't seem to understand. ... See More , someone has to stop this ...NOW
We do NOT want a wall. More boarder security NOT a wall.
STAND FIRM MR PRESIDENT!
We do NOT want a wall. More boarder security NOT a wall.
U can but u don't need a wall to do it...build bridges  not walls! Move I to 21st century

Trump negotiated to help a million illegals - dreamers, yet it was still rejected.  How much is it costing to support a million illegals??? And it still isn't good enough. They oppose everything that Trump stands for, and not in the best  interest of the USA.
Fix it? You can't even president.
God Bless you Mr. President and thank you for making Americans first.
Awesome President !!  Build the wall!!
About time to concede. Loggerheads

Thank you President Trump for standing strong for all of us. You are our voice!
Every president we have had for that past 40 years was going to fix our immigration problem but none of them ever did, they just gave it lip service and kicked the can down the road. Now we finally have a president that is actually trying to get the problem taken care of and everyone is having a cow. Keep up the fight President Trump, the people are behind you and want the immigration problem fixed and our border secured.
YOU TELL nancy she and her buddy schumer are out of a job BUT you will give them 3 squares and a cot and a nice orange jumpsuite for the next 30 years
So much patience our President has to protect America's citizens.  The wall is so needed and frankly I  don't see where Nancy Pelosi is coming from or whomever agrees with her. Why would she not vote for the wall when the result of not having it will hurt our citizens. Is she anti-American?   Thank you President Trump for the protection!  We need to feel secure in our country!
Angel families?  What about "gold star" families?
Ahhhhh, the latest edition of FAKE News and state sponsored propaganda!  smdh
LOVE these updates from Lara Trump, we can't depend on the MSM covering these topics.
Be cheaper for Nancy to disappear. Ask Clintons
Trump pledges to continue to victimize "Angel" families by using their pain for politics...Disgusting
You also said that San Antonio has a border wall.
Nancy is stubborn as a mule !!!!!!
You also said that San Antonio has a border wall.
Imagine if Hillary had been elected  !
If Hillary won the country would be invading Iran for Israeli interests. Get 9/11 reinvestigated as the Saudi's have ties to Zionist Israel.
Victoria A. Deobald  That's interesting considering she doesn't support Israel and she supports all the reasons 9/11 happened.
Trump pledges to continue to victimize "Angel" families by using their pain for politics...Disgusting
I sent my letter! Democrats have to help to protect our country, President Trump and Republicans need bi partisan support for this crisis. Caravans of people keep marching to the border, something has to be done immediately!!!!
Love Our PRESIDENT TRUMP!
My heart breaks for these families! Build that wall. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank you DJT for your free service our forefathers would be proud of you !
You're gonna love President Trump even more once you do your taxes for 2018. Trust me. He is the right person for the people.❤ Thank you, Mr. President.

Call the state of emergency.  Those caravans keep coming.
So you expect to make a deal by offering a temporary solution and you expect a permanent wall?  You’re a terrible negotiator.  How about permanent status for the DACA problem for your permanent steel fence?   SMH
We tell Nancy to build the wall.  But unlike God, SHE does not listen.
You made a pledge to yourself.
Stop the chain migration!
Build our wall - God bless you Mr President

Lara and the Tone deaf tRump Crime Family Millionaires Tell the Furloughed: DONT worry, be happy! 😤🤬🤮  A ‘Let Them Eat Cake’ Shutdown  Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, gave food to furloughed government workers on Tuesday at the World Central Kitchen in Washington. While tRump’s Swamp Embarrasses Themselves  By Katie Rogers Jan. 24, 2019 WASHINGTON —  Mr. Trump has stocked his administration with millionaires and the garden-variety wealthy who have not been as careful with their messaging, and Democrats are making the most of it.  The ripest target of partisan prey is Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who pads around Washington in $600 embroidered slippers and is known for frequenting high-end restaurants. On Thursday, he expressed confusion about why furloughed federal workers were visiting food banks.  “I don’t really quite understand why” the food bank visits were happening, Mr. Ross, 81, said on CNBC. Some banks were offering interest-free loans, he said, and because the workers would eventually get their back pay, “there’s no real reason why they shouldn’t be able to get a loan against it.”  Asked by reporters to respond to Mr. Ross’s comments, Mr. Trump said that he had not heard them, “but I do understand, perhaps, he should have said it differently.” He went on to suggest that “local people” who operate banks and grocery stores would be understanding of people who have missed pay.  By that time, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, had already called Mr. Ross’s comments “appalling” and further evidence of the administration’s “callous indifference” toward federal workers. But it was Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Mr. Trump’s most visible shutdown adversary, who invoked the French Revolution.  “Is this the ‘let them eat cake’ kind of attitude,” Ms. Pelosi said, “or call your father for money?” — a reference to an earlier taunt of the president after a shutdown meeting.  Larry Kudlow, President Trump’s top economic adviser, insisted he isn’t “out of touch” after he and other members of the administration fumbled their shutdown messaging. He also said his staff are “working for free” because they “believe in President Trump.”   Larry Kudlow, President Trump’s top economic adviser, insisted he isn’t “out of touch” after he and other members of the administration fumbled their shutdown messaging. He also said his staff are “working for free” because they “believe in President Trump.”  But Mr. Ross is not the only one whose remarks required some cleanup. Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, faced days of criticism this week after an interview published Monday in which she said the shutdown amounted to “a little bit of pain, but it’s going to be for the future of our country.”  She appeared Thursday on Fox News to say that she felt for federal workers and that her original comments were taken out of context by the “mainstream media.”  Joining Mr. Ross and Ms. Trump on Thursday was Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser, who turned up in the White House briefing room to tell reporters that the shutdown was “just a glitch” and to defend how connected he was to its effects.  “Am I out of touch?” Mr. Kudlow said. “I don’t think I’m out of touch. I’m addressing the problem.”  Mr. Kudlow also seemed to disagree with a reporter who told him that coming to work during a shutdown was not, in fact, volunteer work because workers “believe in” the president.  “Give them credit, O.K.?” Mr. Kudlow said. “They honor us by their service.”  Mr. Kudlow’s comments drew a rebuke from Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, who suggested that people in the administration meet with workers to learn firsthand of the shutdown’s effects.  “If Mr. Kudlow, Mr. Ross, or literally anyone in this Administration would actually meet with federal workers and listen to their stories,” Mr. Warner said on Twitter, “they’d know how insulting these kinds of comments are.”  Mr. Trump, appears to be listening to the Democratic criticism but not responding to the nuances of it.  On Thursday, he appeared to be watching the news conference where Ms. Pelosi made her reference to Marie Antoinette. As she was speaking, he cherry-picked a snippet of her criticism as a real-time rebuttal for his Twitter feed — one that seemed to miss her larger point about his administration being too out of touch to understand the problem.  Excerpted from  -NYT
We Love You and are behind you! God Bless POTUS, his family, and all White Hats! Thank You for fighting for us. Nancys trip was more important than We The People considering she declined 5 minutes BEFORE your proposal, and left the country anyway. No protection for us I guess.  Unfreakin real.
Nancy Pelosi is the one who should be impeached. We need to secure our borders.
We know President Trump is doing all under his power to stop the killings.
the Democrats have a big heart filled with compassion; they're simply not understanding the millions it's costing us each day - nor the crime coming with a few that enter...
Our government leaders also took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and to "well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office" that they now hold. We believe they are derelict in those duties.
Trump’s propaganda news. Trump’s a disgrace. He needs to be impeached, then imprisoned!
You promised to drain the swamp. Sadly,  the swamp is deep and wide. Not just democrat. It was built by those who put money over everything else. MSM pushes  it every waking hour and no one can stop it! No one! Me Me Me. Networks dangling fame and fortune in front of poorly raised children that have no moral center.  Our government thrives on ou discourse,  black against white American/ Mexican, gay/ straight.  As long as we're fighting each other they win.

trump,you are not fixing it, you're making it worse.
God Bless Mr President Trump.
Keep fighting for us Mr.President🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Uh you also promised us Killary would go to jail and that has not happened either. I am beginning to wonder just who did I vote for !
So when is Mexico paying for it?
Bless the Angels and families

But a wall doesn't solve any problems. Fight for something that makes sense - like stopping climate change.
So when is Mexico paying for it?
What happened to the fantastic health plan that was going to be great for everyone, and you were going to put in place the first day you were in office? Too complicated to figure out after two years of figuring?
Nancy Pelosi,TRUMP IN 2020!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
It should be illegal for democrats in congress to hold the country hostage like this. What if this fight were about gun ownership rights. Stand your ground POTUS. Pelosi will not pass anything and it is making her look worse and worse. Its clear Trump is trying and she is not. Its on her.
It is not safe where I live as I face the chance if being shot dead.
done...she better settle for the wall
No one trusts you to fix anything.  Listen to the experts.  The wall would waste funds.  Pelosi made at least six better suggestions.
I love the fighter in him.Finally a President with a backbone willing to stand up and fight for the American people.
ONE GOD + ONE PRESIDENT + ONE USA = TRUMP 2020.
But a wall doesn't solve any problems. Fight for something that makes sense - like stopping climate change.
Thank you, Mr. President!  Stand strong for our Angel families so we can save others from similar sorrow & loss.
Overheard: "The only person trump ever hired who was actually qualified to do their job was Stormy Daniels."
The democrat leadership needs to fell this ladys pain

WE WANT A WALL AND THE BEST BORDER SECURITY NOW NANCY!  #Buildthatwall
No wall . . . Resign petty little man.  Please for the sake of a greatful nation.
Then hurry up!  Instill e-verify, build the wall, and deport every illegal here!
And what is actually broken?
President Trump lucky time 22.1.2019 to 25.2.2019 very lucky time 6.2.2019 to 18.2.2019
i am so very proud of you for standing strong, God bless you President Donald J. Trump. Praying for you daily.
Ms. Mendozo might want to think about bringing the horror of what she and other Angel families have been put through directly. Obtain crime scene and autopsy photos of their loved ones and show those to the American people and Democrats. I know it's a terrible thing to contemplate, but maybe the stark reality of such horrors will have an impact and help put a stop to such atrocities happening to other families.
This is just one state where families will lose their hud/section 8 housing. All states have this help for families. Call your legislators to tell them to stop the shutdown. https://youtu.be/NZAsE-HDHx4
RIF Monday. 31 days. 100,000 least essential government workers (obstructionists) gone.
So heartbreaking for the true victims! Stand Tall & Stay Strong and NEVER STOP SHARING YOUR TRUTH. God FINALLY sent a President that loves his country and Walks the Walk! May the Blood of Jesus always protect him and his family and may the Voices of these families be heard loudly and be recognized. God Bless!
Thank you, Mr. President.  Please build the wall.
she  doesn't  care!    I  think  something  is  wrong  with  her!
God bless this woman I am so sorry for your loss.God bless President Trump
Not having a wall is really showing how weak and vulnerable our country is and how and where to invade our country for terrorist activity.

Steve maybe you do not laugh so much
When the nuclear war come to USA for lack of democrats
For kim or Putin or Xi anything is possible
And you and your family dies for radiation effect
Good luck with that .
God bless this woman I am so sorry for your loss.God bless President Trump
No Trump, I’m telling YOU that I DON’T want the wall.
Campaign sponsored propaganda is not "real news".
We don’t want a wall. We are all for secure boarders but once again we need to do it in a way that will be more efficient and less expensive. There is a reason we have technology... walls don’t work.
Stand firm for the American people!!!🇺🇸❤️
and yet you have done nothing about it...
Wasn’t a problem when republicans controlled both houses for the first two years of your presidency. Hmmm.
I’m amazed that anyone would dessagree to spend money on anything that makes our country more secure. I guess the Dems don’t lock the doors in their homes?
Our Sunday lesson is on Nehemiah rebuilding the wall ... Sound familiar? Read it chapter 5 an 6
Good luck with that .
Fix it .!! America has spoken ! Term🇺🇸🇺🇸 Limits !!#

Yet you allow DACA. Totally pathetic.
If the Progressive Democrat Party, an offshoot of communism as is socialism and fascism does not accept Saturday's proposal from President Trump, it is time to adjust the size of the federal government to the funded level and combine the unfunded agencies with the funded government eliminating all nonessential jobs and services. The Progressivism Democrat Party uses Communist tactics and is dysfunctional in a democratic form of government. They are not negotiating because they cannot. Their ideology does not let them.
Angel families? Work on all the Americans killing Americans. It's a much bigger problem.
You spelled racists family wrong! 😎
Thank you, Mr President! Please declare a state of emergency and build the wall without the Dems. #MAGA #Trump2020 #buildthewallnow

I want a wall to stem illegal immigration/invasion of our country.
Expose Commie Trudeau and his Saudi oil ties. A traitor to the Canadian and American people whom are family.
You spelled racists family wrong! 😎
The US-Canada border is 5,525 miles long and it receives less resources and fewer border agents than the US-Mexico border (which is 1,954 miles.) The number of illegal border crossings along the US-Canada border has increased by 142% in just one year. Fenatyl, Marijuana, Ecstacy and coke are the most common drugs smuggled into our country from Canada. It also serves as an easy entrance for terrorists to enter into the US. Border agents along the US-Canada border have made statements about how easy it is for human trafficking and drug smuggling to slip through, due to the lack of man power and resources. Thousands of traffickers and smugglers illegally cross, completely unnoticed by border security and drawing all of our attention on the Southern border only makes it easier for them to do so. The Northern border is currently a bigger threat to us than the Southern border. Overstayed visas also account for 2/3 of illegal immigration and Canadians are the highest when it comes to over stayed visas
This needs to stop!!  We are paying taxes to families not even in the usa??  https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/filing/credits/itin-child-tax-credit/
present ur case for the wall, dems present their case, america votes, we live with the decision , DONE
Thank you for never giving up or getting discouraged!
Stand strong President Trump! We elected you to do just what you are doing! We stand firm with you! #BuildthatWall!
But I don’t think the wall is the best way to secure the border. Have you seen how many tunnels have been dug lately? There are better technologies available.
Well, please don't stop there.  After the border wall, there's still an utterly ineffective Congress that refuses to acknowledge, much less offer a real solution for, the broken immigration system that Congress itself created.
Expose Commie Trudeau and his Saudi oil ties. A traitor to the Canadian and American people whom are family.
Here we have another illegal killing Americans.  Deport all of them  Man, 19, detained on immigration concerns wanted in 4 Nevada murders  https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-19-detained-on-immigration-concerns-wanted-in-4-Nevada-murders
As President, your main job is to run the government- not shut it down! Please President Trump, open all the government, then work on border security! This government shutdown will go down in history as Republican Trump’s government shutdown, the longest government shutdown in history, and is hurting the Republican Party.
Disgusting that the families tried to meet with Pelosi and Schumer and they refused. I wish nature would take its course with those 2.
Borders can be safe with other means look into those and stop holding federal workers hostage
Happy 2nd anniversary Pres Trump for being our President - inauguration day!   Have a very nice day!!❤️💙🇺🇸
Democrats are so socialistic.  It’s really unbelievable
What we'd really like to hear is what other parts of the very broken immigration system are you looking at? The legalization process for non-resident aliens can take months or years in some cases. And the work visa situation is a huge problem as well. It's not only about border security.
Close the border before the next wave of illegals gets here !!!
Stop paying the politicians and see how fast they will come to the table to negotiate ..... Donald J. Trump   OUR PEOPLE NEED TO E PAID !!!!

Linda Stienbarger what invasion?
Patti Cullen go south to the border and you will see. And more are on are their way. Please dont think I am against imagination ,I have many friends  that have come to America legally and are wonderful hard working people. What  is happening at the southern border is an invasion by people that have no intention to imagrate legally. That should give us reason to be concerned for our country.!! Build the wall,technology, what ever it takes to keep us safe. It is just an older lady's opinion, not looking to cause a FB backlash
Close the border before the next wave of illegals gets here !!!
I am for Trump 2020 unless he caves for Amnesty
Call a national emergency President Trump!
Dear Trump Need negotiate with one way flight to Afghanistan with booze and family with pelosi for border wall!
You have done it from day one and that is why you are president. Thank you so much!
$5.7B = 230 miles of wall. Knock off the BS and let's start solving real problems.
We need to deport Democrats. we need to open the government. We need to protect the Border. And you mr. President keep doing the right work .🇺🇸🇺🇸MAGA 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸
The border is safe and secure!
I love you mr. Trump I love the way you scamed senior citizens of there life savings with a phony college! I love the way you grab women's puss+. I love the way you cheated on your wife after she had your son. I love the way with the shutdown your making people lives like hell!        I LOVE YOU MR. PRESIDENT!                          NOT!!
I voted for Donald Trump, Therefore He knows I want the Wall. You can not tell or ask A Evil Hateful person like Nancy anything about Saving America, because her Goal is to Destroy America.

I want to tell Nancy to start working....And also working for Americans! Work it out!!
🇺🇸 Thsnk You President Trump 🇺🇸For you hard work!❤️Praying for You!🇺🇸
Stand firm for the Americans that voted you in office.  Trump and Melania 2020

I sent to her my letter And also i was very clear  writing in my explanation. I hope she understands my concerns and worries.
Build the wall and build it now!!!  We support you!!
Anyone who doesn't want our borders secure is an enemy of our country
Interesting story about "Joe" the man you picked to sit behind you at rallies  The self-described "good" person--hey Joe-you're not. Figured those folks had to be right out of central casting.
Amen Mr President.  I really wish someone would do a forensic audit on the Democratic Party and Mueller in particular.  It is impossible to get a valid number on even just his expenditures much less the entire RNC.
Protect America and build the wall  Don’t have a fence around your house? If you have it. Why?
Hey Nancy it is time to stop giving money to other countries and planned parenthood. It is time for our countries security to be first on your to do list.
Promises made, promises kept. Stay safe and be blessed.
And you idiots call yourselves patriotic Americans who want to rid America of its actual institutions of democracy.
DO not listen to Ann Coulter or far right folks...stay true and keep fighting
Good job, Mr. President!! Behind you 100 percent.
Will some one please remind the damn government as a whole who they work for? They don't work for the party. They work for us!!!   Now put up that damn wall and let's move on!
This deal had everything they wanted and Republicans wanted.. so why did Democrats turn it down🤔
Please reopen the government so people can be paid.  federal workers are innocent.
Time to declare a National Crisis, since hateful Pelosi and crying Schumer won't help to keep us safe.  BUILD the wall. #TRUMP2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
a wall will not fix illegals and drugs coming in from Mexico...  Florida is surrounded by ocean and people still get desperate enough and find a way into Florida
Keep up the fight for us.  Prayers for my President.
Keep fighting! We will keep supporting you!
Please dont take our guns away. Qe have alot of drug dealers and bad people up here in Washington state that have nothing to do with the wall. You take our guns away and you take our safety away....that and you will have a civil war on your hands so just think on that😉

Dorothy Stewart And, how's that working out for you? Smh
Keep fighting! We will keep supporting you!
Please stand firm in demanding the funding for the wall Mr. President. Getting that wall built has been a problem for the American people for a very long time and we finally have hope what was started long ago will finally be accomplished! Don't let the liberal Democrats hold us hostage!
Best damn President we have had sense Regan!  Stand strong President Trump!   Love everything you are doing! Stand  strong!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Praying for you sir... along with many other intercessors @ 1:11 pm daily
You promised to pay all your workers and contractors, ask them how that went. Your promises mean NOTHING >>>
God Bless the Angel Families and The White House.....🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
The swamp creatures are getting dug out of the swamp ! 😊
Nice! God bless you President Trump!
Build the wall - Nancy, he won, out your hate aside and for once think of America.
The Americans are not satisfied with occupying your land, killing your people and plundering your wealth. They come years later and make films to talk about how painful it was for their soldiers.

On this day in 1981, Ronald Reagan was sworn into office, so it seems appropriate to quote him"...tear down that wall!"
That wall was about communist and to re-unite the 2 Germanies... this wall is to keep the illegal, criminal invaders out and have legal immigration enforced!
Tunde Lakatos This wall is to segregate!  Just like the Berlin wall it has been sold to people in a scare method to solve a problem that it will not address and only cause isolationism and segregation.  If you truly want to address the drug problem, you should look at our ports, airports and the border were trucks are passing inspection and flooding our country.  If you truly want to weed out the de minimus amount of truly bad immigrants look elsewhere because they aren't crossing the border illegally.  If you want to address terrorists attempting to come into this country, look at the airports and marine vessels.  You might want to look at Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia as well.  Documented that the preponderance of terrorists are from those countries.  I understand you think Saudi Arabia is our friend and ally. That women and children walking hundreds of miles to escape political and gender discrimination are the enemy. I understand because Donald J. Trump told you to believe.

I’m afraid Mr Trump your fighting a losing battle now that the liberals have the Muslims involved we Republicans are so outnumbered...
First of all she is reading right of a prompter and second can you sound a little more sympathetic like seriously!!! Have some emotion
I believe in the Wall and I believe in a secure Border!
This issue of border security has been compromised so many times in the past. Now is the time to take action. No more compromising Congress!
They just don’t care about Americans, they just hate the Pres nothing else matters ,
Awesome! Is your carer Melanie and her son enjoying their break in Florida?  Military plane flying them back to DC? Who's paying?
Thank you President Trump

I don’t understand. Why didn’t he tell the Republican speaker of the House the last 2 years to build the wall. Can someone explain that to me?
Cora Pantoja yeah you do. Illegal wars, so called nation building, failed Pax Americana, millions killed or displaced, Europe overrun with so called war migrants etc, etc etc

God Bless President Trump! You still have a lot of swamp cleanup! Rashida, AOC ETC!
So sorry for your loss! Now let all of us build that wall.
Amen thank you President Trump
The democrats new strategy for the 2020 elections. A times reporter stated this on BBC.  Then a senator said the same thing.  President Trump would Not get the money for the wall,  he doesn't have many supporters, and in so many words his supporters are uneducated, drug addicted, deplorable people. This is how they want to keep saying this so the people will believe it. President Trump wants to keep his campaign  promise to build the wall.  The democrats want to make sure he does not keep that promise to the people and lose his supporters, that is there new strategy to win in 2020. I guess the democrats don't know the spirit of a deplorable.
Apowerfulmen,change the world forever
Keep up the good work Mr. President. Stand strong. We’re behind you.
Unless Ginsberg shows herselF to be functioning  our elected President needs to chose a 'ninth'  Conservative Supreme court judge, Wouldn't that would be a hoot ., re: Ninth circuit court who Democrats use to block every needed change..we need tended to..He can and while we have Senate (nuclear) .

I don't want a wall. They don't work.
That’s funny when rival gang members came into my back yard and had a shot out with the gang next door I had a wall put up and guess what no one has gotten back on to my property.
Well if they want to they can dig under it like boarder patrol has pictures of. Or they can over stay a vacation visa to your back yard BBQ.
Praise God, don’t stop, don’t give in to protecting our citizens President Trump!! As a Texan, we’ve had this problem for way to long!! We as citizens should be as safe as we can!  You’ve came at this appointed time, and you’re doing the Right Thing here! God bless you!!
Yes, you also promised #NoDACA and #NoAmnesty. Keep your promises.  #MAGA
There is a legal process for entry into America.
Is this TRUE - Laura dear, check this please '50 Billion set aside in the 2006 Secure Fence Act'. Can that be true, is it true. If so where did the money go. Where did the taxpayer CASH go, down a sink hole. Was that down south money ??
Ignore Nancy!  Take a vote from the American people.  Then build the wall.
Really???? Then why didnt you build the wall when the GOP controlled Congress for last 2 yrs???? Just as I thought, you needed to blame Dems and create chaos as papi Putin asked you to....
We don’t want/need an ineffective wall, but we do want comprehensive immigration reform, and more border security using technology, training, and SOME physical barriers where appropriate.  Reopen the govt. now and work on it.  Quit using 800,000 federal workers as pawns.
How about we increase “foreign aid” to Mexico and have them build it on their side???

Our borders aren't the problem. You are.
Thank you Mr.President.  Build the wall. Because you did not repeat the deep sorrow that understood the commentary of the woman caster and when you should push forward the wall for peace and order improvement even from a part necessary with precedence，I thought personally.
The Republicans are NOT STUPID!!!  Dems WON'T negotiate now, they won't  negotiate EVER, if Trump opens the government now. 😡😡😡😡 Declare a NATIONAL EMERGENCY and build the wall!
Gated communities suck. Maybe with proper border control and national sovereignty, we won’t feel the need to have gated communities anymore. Build the wall !
Today is my birthday 65 and I am so blessed to have a terrific President, out lived Obama care and I am healthy in spite of it! Don't forget to look in the mirror and say "Sherry's birthday wish is to have you as her President 4 more years"! To see secure  boarders secure with current employment laws followed, Human trafficking greatly curtained, Obamacare replaced, more and more Americans employed feeling the joy of working for the support of their families! Most of us get our news from other sources U,S, French and British news are as a fairytale for those that deny the facts before their eyes! Thank-you for a Great birthday!

Letitia Werle  were you there personally watching them do this or are you a total liar just like Donald duck trump
Jason Kustra It was caught on camera rude person.
So, thoughts and prayers aren't good enough for them? What about all the people killed by the mass shootings that we have almost EVERYDAY?

I am a firm Trump supporter. My opinion may not be like other conservatives. I think Trump should propose a way for those who qualify as DACA young people to become US citizens. It should be fair and relatively easy if they have no serious criminal background. If the president and the Rs did this,it would take the wind out of the sails of the Dems for a long time.🤓
They want numbers TruthPharm Binghamton Ny page look it up !
Please open the Gov, tell those that are blocking our wall that you will not hold America hostage because of THEIR unwillingness to work with you. You represent US and we need the WALL!!!!!  This completely lays at their feet! This is  on them!
Can we impeach Pelosi and Schumer?
Not nearly enough shares of this post!  The MSM will not report on it.  Get the message out!!!
Mr President, I have a proposal that I think might end the shutdown. Your a billionaire Mr. President. Why don't you put up the 5.6 billion or whatever it is and if it works like you say for 1 year. You get your money back. Provided you don't get impeached in which case you would probably lose everything you've got, and go to jail anyway can so no harm no foul. What do ya say. Can we get a deal😁?
This morning I prayed that the Lord would deal with Nancy Pelosi (and others I named specially by name).  I asked Him to give her a short chance to change her heart or, if she will not change, to remove her.  The Word of God says to pray specific prayers.  It also says whatever we ask in Jesus’ name we will receive.  I asked Him not to drag this out.  He will either remove her from office or from this world.  I believe with all my heart in prayer.  Pray the same, and join your prayer with mine.
Nancy can't take the heat from these folks.
Yes voters need to contact their representatives
All he is doing is starving the family's in need
Propaganda from the Kremlin...I mean white house!  Never thought I would see it!  First step in destroying our freedom of speech and thoughts.  Long live the Free press and our Constitution! Resist and fight!
Why are we giving this Pelosi so much power?
You couldn't negotiate your way out of a paper bag
Wow! Thank you for sharing! Love and pray for our President Trump and family and also now praying for you angel Moms! Blessings strength and wisdom for all!!!!😘🙏🏻❤️
Mr. President, I'm an ordinary citizen residing in Houston, TX. I'm proud to have a President like you, true to your words all for the good of everyone. You have Done ENOUGH . I believe it's time you leave the job to the implementors. Stop insisting but because this provision has been approved long, long ago congress and senate should be serious that Wall issue had to be done ASAP. Let GO and MOVE on.make sure that our government employees get back to work , lift the government shutdown. We want you to keep the presidency . God bless.
Sounds more like revenge on a culture for a few people's mistakes ,

Trump caused this shut down and no one else he even said so.
The "AMERICAN"people appreciate you President Trump!!! We are behind you 💯%!!!! MAGA💯🇺🇸
Never surrender to the Left...they will through a stick in your bike spokes every chance they get...gather the American worker/taxpayer and explain that border security will render value for every American...end the illegal immigrant disarming of fair health care and National Security! Now!
YES! I AGREE! I LOVE YOU MR.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP!!💙
TASS reports: Some 84,000 take to streets in France during Yellow Vests protests (yesterday). Where are the mainstream media reports?
Wall, wall, wall, now, now, now now please dont ask again
Thanks president jeb bush. How bout amnesty next?
Sounds more like revenge on a culture for a few people's mistakes ,
Thanks president jeb bush. How bout amnesty next?
Well done to the president, definitely right...
Ella Lafer-de-waal what on God's green earth has this Russian spy done for America? Oh right! A Yuuuge tax cut for his billionaire buddies and CEO friends..have you seen the deficit since he took office? You know 200 indictments ago...The U.S. Treasury reported that October’s deficit was $100 billion, an increase of $37 billion or 58% from a year ago. While one month may not be a trend, it puts the full-year deficit on a path from $779 billion in fiscal 2018 to $1 trillion in fiscal 2019. He's a business genius? lol suckers!
Steve Tash He received a great inheritance from the previous sages ... and furthermore one must turn to the drugged democrats 🤥🤒with complaints....
Secure our borders!! I wonder what color the wall will be.
Why can’t the compromise be hiring more border patrol or stationing troops instead of building a wall?  I would support that.
Awesome President thank God.
The Democrat party are now the servents of LUCIFER!
I fully support the president and his wall, but it's not enough. The wall needs to go into the ground, about 25feet, have seismic sensors to know if anyone is tunneling under it, and be wide enough to patrol on top of it. (Drops mic)
I do not favor a wall because I don’t think it will be effective. I favor hiring more border patrol agents or stationing troops on the border to turn people away even though it is probably more expensive.
Dont give in to those assholes ever keep standing your ground
President should see this! Never address them https://www.facebook.com/100000577105930/posts/2574398682589343/
Stronger border security is a must.  I pray the ones against it don’t find out too late.

No one wants a damn wall we aren’t Berlin Germany
Americans need to secure its borders like Israel and Russia.
Israel and Russia are basically fascist dictatorships with zero morals and who rule with propaganda torture and corruption
America does not need to be anything like them
And to quote Donald trump himself “it doesn’t matter what we build the wall out of or how good it is if they wanna get in they’re gonna get in”
“Nothing is impenetrable” Donald trump
So by trumps own words the wall is Americans throwing billions of dollars in the trash

Omarosa is a smart cookie. She taught us all a lot. She protected herself well by recording everything that he had to talk about. So now we are finding a lot more about him in this new day and it is not good. So I take my hat off to you Omarosa for a job well done.
Stay strong, mr. President.  There’s  a lot of people behind you.  But, please, no more amnesty offers.  Please!
Yes I stand with President Trump always
Thank you President Trump.
We have a great President!! I thank God for him!!
Keep Americans safe build the wall?
Pelosi is too busy trying to figure out how to fund her vacation boondoggle to Belgium, Egypt and Afghanistan, supposedly to visit the troops.  Not a lot of them in Belgium or Egypt, and a flyover of Afghanistan while she waves at the window from 35000 feet isn’t exactly a visit.
Investigate as to how Nancy Pelosi has accumulated 100 million dollars. Hmmmm.

Just a thought how about putting the hurting where it belongs.  Of the 800,000 not getting a paycheck during the Government shutdown.  How about the only ones who suffer are the ones making the votes.  It's not the American people sitting in those stubborn rooms of negotiations.
Since only US Citizens have the right to vote in the USA WHY should non-citizens be counted when determining the number of representatives from any area!
You made a deal for daca. Wrong move!! Very wrong of you!!!

A pledge from you is worth exactly jack 💩
Good morning Mr President,  just saying we love you and your family and are praying for you
Absolutely agree this Democratic are horrible
So you sacrifice government workers in order to get this stupid wall.
Great idea!....now, how about listening to the experts as to how you do that(?)
We need the wall because Mexico president is letting everybody in he has open border
May the soul rest in peace
Pelosi needs to work on the deal

What a bunch of crock. Fix something that is actually broken like Russia’s influences in the WH and all the lies that comes out of there. Break those ties!
Thank you!! Keep up the fight for the wall!
#Trumppower Making America Great!
Pelosi needs to retire! Either she is too stupid or dementia is setting in.
Don’t let them talk you into opening the government and then we will talk please don’t fall for this trap they did it once don’t let it happen again build the wall
Mr. President, please stand firm and build the wall. Now. We need to be secure. (I live in Texas.)
What's up with the 3 year extension on DACA & TSA? Not happy about that. Not sure compromising on something that is wrong in order to get something that is right is the way to go. Stop pandering to the Dems and stick to what is right Donald J. Trump and we real Americans will stick with you!
Take South America away from Russia and China.. Make it, another State! Kick the Rome out of it asap.
Sir 2 good objectives I suggest you stop combining.  Work them both independently.

We true Americans are behind you 1000%, Mr. President!
Lena Sorrells Resnick So are you saying because I may or may Not believe in everything exactly like you, I'm not a True American? Wow what has this country come too? So 😢
Janey Renteria I am saying if you don’t love this country and want to protect it against illegal invaders, then yes, you are not a patriot. Sorry if the truth hurts your little feelings 😩😆🤣
Lena I agree with you 100%
Corrupt Nancy pelosi showing her true colors.of course she can't face the victims of her evil policies.
What’s so funny is that this country was stolen from the native Americans lol but we keeping everyone else out
If I'm behind our President on any of his undertakings because I definitely don't agree with all of them, I'm behind him on this one 1000%+
Hey trump, angry democrats counter offer,  NO WALL,
Lara, I would like to thank you for reporting the "Truth News", a lot of times the truth is hard to hear however it must be heard.  It is in plain view, many things at the border have been neglected for quite some time, of course, the solutions won't come quickly, taking the first step by closing the door will stop the bleeding, so to speak with that being done, there will be a clear picture of what is broken in the system and that can be addressed  properly one problem at a time. How can we solve these major problems while living in the unresolved major issues day after day.? Some say no wall, others say yes a wall, well let me say this... if I sit at my window and look out to the road and there I see a man lying on the shoulder of the road, blood pouring from his head, what will I do?  Close the blind or pick up the phone, make the call then go tell him help is on the way. So yes I chose, I made the call, then quickly ran to him only to find it was my own brother laying there. wouldn't I be rejoicing that I did something.?  We the American people must understand that doing nothing or believing that those who have been in office all this time are telling us they are going to do this, that, or the other thing ( which they never got around to doing)  at least the President is acting on it.  Hopefully, we can all see clearly that it is time to act.  So I leave you with my thoughts and feelings wishing you all well, God Bless.!
I love the fact the white house now has their own news channel just like CNN or fox ..except this one has real news non of that poison cnn dishes out

Lena I agree with you 100%
How long is this wall and where will it be? The VP says 234 miles. Is this true? Maybe if the president were more specific and consistent, the congress would commit our money. The founding fathers were so wise to plan a system of checks and balances, especially now that we have a petulant president with a history of bankruptcies and lawsuits.
Don't back down!!! WE Stand with you Mr. President. Until the wall is built Do what no other has done. Activate the Militia and We will guard the border and safe guard this great Nation untill it is built. No money has to be spent. IF You ask I Know my self included Many would come forward and Volunteer for guard Detail. My Self like many vets took a Oath to Protect and Defend the Constitution of the United States against All Enemy foreign and domestic Sir. And we have never been re leaved of that Oath. WE stand ready to Serve again!! God Bless you Sir
America is so blessed to have you President Trump
By all means fight, but what your doing isn’t working try fighting the problem from within. Make the people want to stay where they are.
On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
Build the wall Nancy, we need it!
By the way anyway they're trying to find a way in the office to impeach him so who's going to be the next president after that happens because I know y'all don't have my vote
I am a trump supporter but enough is enough !! Open up our government and forget the wall ‼️‼️‼️‼️it will come back on the Dems #karma

Pray for the Angel families that Nancy P would not even walk out of her office to see she is a disgrace to America and the democrat party
Open border field..open US citizens pockets that will pay somehow.
State run media at its finest. This should scare you.
Pelosi, don't want the border wall, yet she has a wall around her house and a very high fence.
#MAGA I LOVE MY PRESIDENT ❣️

We want the wall and get this shut down settled

Democrats can't stand someone who keeps their promise ! They lie to get elected, and promise is just politicians way to office....
Dan Stout which promise are u talking about? So far he’s running my Country like he runs his businesses....straight into bankruptcy. But keep thinking he’s great cause the only thing great about him is his ego.
dear donald, we do not want your wall. we do not want it,not at all!
This isn't Trump's wall!!!!   It's the USA's wall!!  It's MY wall!!  It's everyone that voted for Trump  wall.  Make it happen
Lara your hot!!Trump is the man!! Build the damn wall!!!
What kind of chicken hides behind walls when this is the greatest country in the world.  Walls for chickens!
President Trump go before Congress and tell them you will give up on the border wall if every Senator and Congressman tears down their wall or fence protecting their homes! Give them two choices. They either agree to the wall to protect our borders or they tear down their wall that protects their homes!
FAKE MEDIA TAKING  BRIBES FROM DEMOCRATS TOO ? CNN  THE MAINSTREAM  ?
We're standing firm with you, Mr. President.  We're unwavering like you Mr. President.
The only way Trump can stay out of prison is by keeping the government closed.

What happened to Mexico will pay ?????🤦‍♀️🤪🤷‍♀️🙆‍♀️👎🏻
Don't give up, we are praying for you and helping the unemployed in the government in Mobile, Alabama.
Funny thing is, the wall isn’t an immigration reform... it’s just a wall, an expensive useless wall
Um, just open the Government and continue to negotiate.  Duh.
Trump 👏👏👏🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾God bless you 2020👏👏👏🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
This President has our backs he stands up for us Americans which other presidents didnt have the balls to
I don’t think she cares what we want.
Am black but a real fan of Trump ,I pray for him to wine 2020 vote MAGA
Julie Williams what do you mean?
President Trump thanks for all you do and trying to fix our borders, you are the only President who has took a stand on this, and my family thanks you, you have integrity and you also know what we need, build the wall, we have to, save our sweet country, God Bless You..
Keep going. Agree with the wall
Look at everyone selling America for their paychecks! Dear Americans and friends, I believe, I believe, Donald Trump is just an ignorant flunky for wealthy special interests in government and in health  care and  that they are bankrupting our future for their wealth. He is deceiving us with the republican Congress and protecting special interests in health care and special interests in general. They are paying lawmakers for their support and complicity. He is not helping in his terrible immigration with his super rude noise; he is hiding and protecting wealthy and selfish interests at the expense of everyone else. The swamp has given Donald Trump directions not to bother them in their money making activities and he is obedient to them and going after defenseless poor people, refugees that need mercy and a humane chance as a ruse to deceive we the people. 	We are being badly governed in his cruel immigration hoax while he is being patted on the back for deceiving the middle class and helping the wealthy lobbies. As proof I offer humble Canada and that they are not as corrupt and arrogant as our non humble elected officials.  	What is the answer but to vote these carpetbagger republicans out of office and never to support Captain Ahab again!
Nancy.....the people want the wall funded , now
Thank you trump build the wall. Build the wall. Illegal come
Build that wall. Take your indifferencies & dislikes away, & let the President do his job Nancy!!
And that's why we voted for you!! Finally a president that actually cares about the USA and acts on it!
ConMan Trumpoganda. Using someone’s pain to stir lies in support of his vanity wall.
Am black but a real fan of Trump ,I pray for him to wine 2020 vote MAGA
Please resign!  You continually embarrass our country   we want logic in place at the border not a wall!
Yes he does Nancy is stalling fact!
Stop paying the members of congress, and no back pay neither
Trump's election promise was for a concrete wall from sea to sea. He is now saying 200 miles of steel fence. Is THAT keeping his promise?
My heart goes out to all the family and friends of these angel mom's,  this atrocity should never have occurred in this country,  when is our government going to care about the American citizens like they care about illegal aliens?
It is time to TAKE ACTION Mr. President.  Take to Twitter later.
Thank you Mr. President for staying strong. We are behind you and pray for you every day! We want a secure border. We want a wall.
ConMan Trumpoganda. Using someone’s pain to stir lies in support of his vanity wall.
So the country can crash and burn but we really need a wall how stupid do  that sound
God bless you and all Angle families.
President Trump ask God for Wisdom like King Solomon did ask in Jesus name.
Keep working on Nancy to change her mind on the wall.  Thank you 😞
Nancy don't want it so she isn't about to do what the people want.
Thank you President Trump for keeping your word and fighting to secure the wall on our southern border. Praying for you that it's a win-win and the wall goes up.
Get her built!!  The wall that is!
It is time Nancy's emotional and mental stability is challenged to continue on as Speaker of the House.  She is gone at this point....and hurting this country and herself.&u%ting this country
Please also fight Pharma and alcohol industry 88k deaths per year
I’m telling you I do not want a wall.  It’s antiquated and shows stuck, uninformed thinking.  Have your minions do some research on what will help the immigration problem.
Mr. President, don’t give in, build that wall. We the people are depending on you.
I’m telling you I do not want a wall.  It’s antiquated and shows stuck, uninformed thinking.  Have your minions do some research on what will help the immigration problem.
How about that promise to fix out broken healthcare system?
Ask a Psychic to contact John McCain and ask why he voted against it.
Please also fight Pharma and alcohol industry 88k deaths per year
There is no solution for a viable affordable healthcare system in a country that has a 40% obese population.
great offer to democrats  dont listen to hardliners  negotiate on bill to open government  2020
Chuck Haas Chuck off!
There is no solution for a viable affordable healthcare system in a country that has a 40% obese population.
How about we also fix our foster system as children are sill being put into abusive homes
stay firm for additional barrier/fence  everything else is negotiable
So everyones gonna act like obama didnt build a wall, huh?
Please re open our government
A proposal being rejected even before it was announced! What does that tell us about the Dems? Come forward and make the deal. Our President has a proposal on the table. We Americans need to get back to our normal life. We need to end the shutdown. We need to be a country with secure border.
Yes...You did it...sir ! and Congratulations TO U... Today is January /20 day of your Presidential inauguration like 45th president of USA  ...
Stay strong Mr President.
Obama gave 150 billion dollars to HIS people of choice ( he only got elected president of the United states by the color of his skin) and this proved to be wrong for the American people. 👍

Mike this President has done so much for this country, I stand with him no matter what.
Stay strong Mr President.
Stay firm.  Build a strong border.
Is there a law that if the speaker of the house is so adamant and ditrustive, about making any law work in Congress with the President that you can override her, excuse me but she isn’t the President! And Thank God for that! Her arrogance is getting to everyone,
Behind you all the way, please don't give up the fight!
There are many good words to say about Pelosi.  I just can't think of any right now.
Stay strong Mr. President!   Give nothing to those Democrats!!
Just a Suggestion:  End the government shutdown by following this procedure and timeline:  1.  Give the President and Congress 5 days to come to an agreement.     a.  If agreement is reached, open up the government.     b.  If no agreement is reached:         1.   The government will immediately re-open based on 2018 spending levels.         2.    The 4 leaders of Congress (2 Republicans + 2 Democrats) will appoint 2 joint committees.                 The committees may include members of all parties or may be partisan.                 a.  The first committee will be appointed by the two Democratic leaders to establish legislation                          on DACA (up to including a path to citizenship).                         1.  The committee will consist of 3 Representatives and 2 Senators.                 b.  The second committee will be appointed by the two Republican leaders to establish legislation                         on border security (to include up to $5.7 billion on a wall/fence).                         1.    The committee wil consist of 3 Representatives and 2 Senators.             3.  Both Committees will have 5 days to establish legislation.         4.  Congress and the President will approve both pieces of legislation as they are written by the              respective committees without further discussion, within 2 days of the legislation being presented.  Advantages of this procedure: 1.  Takes egos out of the process within 5 days. 2.  Maximum of 12 more days of shutdown. 3.  Resolves 2 contentious issues 4.  Eveyone gets what they want. 5.  No one is completely happy. 6.  We can all get on with our lives.
Mike this President has done so much for this country, I stand with him no matter what.
We need a wall to protect patrols who work in dangerous territory.
Oh… we have a broken System alright...  Youre still president
glad you could admit it was broken before he took office
I did? When he said he wanted to run for president!
Wolf Solstice well even bernie n barack said its been broken for yrs...you'll believe them but laugh at trump when he says it? don't make much sense does it?

While some federal employeed  Americans are losing everything at the same time. Brilliant Einstein!!!
Fake Russian president !
President Trump, please build the wall. Protect and keep America safe. God bless you and your family. 🙏🏻 🇺🇸
Can we put Nancy on the other side after you build it?
Stay strong!  There are more people supporting you/backing you than the media & the dems are saying.
I'm glad we have a President that is actually doing something for the American people. Build the wall that's what most of us want! Don't think Congress should get paid while the government is shut down. After all they don't do their jobs.
Won’t the money going to the wall also go back to Americans when they buy material and labor and hiring staff to guard? Like isn’t that  a good thing to?
-Thank  You  Lara   and   Mary   Ann

5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
30 ft high and  American Steel with Sensors..and deep foundation to stop tunneling.
Joanne Buck Yea, And lazers and sharks and sharks with lazers!  No, it does not.
Andy Jenkinson, then if drug barons will use micro lights to fly over the border, then your solution to add more agents wouldn’t solve the problem either, would it?
Andy Jenkinson, then couldn’t those same electronics be used in concert with a wall to stop those from entering illegally? Remember there is more than one problem, which then require more than one solution
Bog Segal Certainly but  if you are paying $500  per inch of wall I am sure it is poor value, especially as walls already exist in the most strategic places. I am not arguing against additional barriers. Trump has claimed down from 2000 miles of wall which was clearly ridiculous as natural barriers exist over much of the border. Why ignore the border with Canada?  How much will it cost to compensate the farmers and other businesses along the wall which will have access to the river removed? If Trump plans to build the wall in the middle of the river that would explain the cost, but a raft upstream could quickly come down either side.  Trump currently said $5.7 billion without releasing the costings or locations. That is a considerable sum to spend on a pig in a poke.

As thousands of AMERICANS struggle due to the shutdown. Way to go, Mr. President! You’ve sure left your mark now.  I sympathize in the Angel families and believe we need to secure our borders. But what about those that are about to be evicted because they already live paycheck to paycheck?   Despicable!
they all do

Build the wall put American citizens first.  MAGA.  President Donald Trump is my President.
She is a card carrying Communist..  wants nothing more than to destroy America
You had Republican control for 2 years. Why didn't they give you the money for your wall????? This is all on you. Not the Democrats!!!! I was hoping the major announcement was you were resigning!
#Trumpshutdown day 30 (Longest in US history). Stop your temper tantrum and end it. It's all on you, as you said yourself. Federal workers and their families are hurting and this is not about national security.
Stand tall,firm,no backing down, assured that you are supported, and knowing that in the history of this problem, you are our only hope to end this fiasco! Unbelievable how this country has changed for the worse!
I seem to recall Mr Trump that Peace in the Middle East was on you to do list when you became President. Will that be happening any time soon? You've only got two years left.
they all do
If you want your stupid wall so bad, pay for it with your own wealth. Stop trying to steal America's money and bankrupt our economy like you do your business.
Draftdodger daddy payed off doctor known fact
Well your presidency is narrowing so better hurry up !!!!!!
Build the wall strong and tall.
God Bless you President Trump he is on your side and so are we! Thank You for keeping this country a great place to live.
She doesn’t care. Just there to collect a pay check.😡😡

Thank you for your determination......!!!!

Keep up the great work mr President, the socialists will not win
Communists whom are not socialists have no socialist agenda. Commies sit on the left to destroy all democratic progress then cry democracy can never work. Karl Marx was a commie cousin to the Rothchildds bankers. Whiet corporate men are not the 1% and never owned slavery nor the colony. Belfour Declaration never should have been signed.

Karl Marx was a commie cousin to the Rothchildds bankers. Whiet corporate men are not the 1% and never owned slavery nor the colony. Belfour Declaration never should have been signed.
Keep up the great work mr President, the socialists will not win
The immigration system is not broken. Enforce the laws as written.
All I will say is how about all democratic in the senate or congress not getting paid. They really don’t know what it’s like not to get paid or live paycheck to paycheck every week whether you have kids or not. Some of us only make 25000 if we are lucky not 100000-400000 thousand a year. Negotiations need to happen, people need to pay their bills. Do we need more people unemployed. No...
So many members of this administration devote so much time and energy to figuring out ways to try to explain blatant lies as remotely resembling something in the neighborhood of a mere miscommunication. How on Earth do people fall for this schlock? To put it bluntly, they might not be thinking hard enough. The technical term for this is "reduced engagement of open-minded and analytical thinking." It’s okay for you to believe what you believe. It is not okay however, for you to insist that everyone else believe the same as you. This border crisis is made up, check the facts. There is a border crisis, but it’s not the southern border, it’s the northern border FACT! We don’t believe you, we get the facts via factcheck.org. STOP LYING TO AMERICA!‬
Please declare a national emergency and get the “barrier” built. I don’t really think most of us care what it’s called. Don’t let the democrats stop this from going forward.
What is it going to take to make an executive order close up our borders. What is taking so long to do such thing
Nancy needs to leave she doesn’t listen to me or you. Yes both my husband and I want the wall.
https://mynews4.com/news/local/person-arrested-in-connection-to-south-reno-murders  This is why!!! For all against the wall! This is why we want it!!!!
Keep organizing the country to take it back never give up. Organizing is what Americans do best collectively under pressure..

Darla Maria Grippa-Pietrangolare  If the dems would stop obstructing the same thing they wanted before Trump was elected we could end this nonsense
Nancy needs to leave she doesn’t listen to me or you. Yes both my husband and I want the wall.
We dont need a wall never had one.
Four decades of old IMMIGRATION laws bad for 2019 update.
You are WAISTING your time with Nancy because she just DOES NOT GIVE A DAM about AMERICANS. She is an AGO MANIAC and has no interest in we 2nd class people called AMERICANS.
Fine I signed it as is, but all that sappy polite crap made me want to throw up. Nancy just needs to have her ass kicked and not be rewarded with kind words.
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby, Of course mama's gonna help build the wall.
Why don’t you think of something that will actually work, like technology.  You can go over and under a wall and you know it.  The people you claim to want to keep out don’t even come into this country that way.
Can we set up a go fund me page for all those federal employees who are not getting a pay check?
Darla Maria Grippa-Pietrangolare  If the dems would stop obstructing the same thing they wanted before Trump was elected we could end this nonsense
Protect America. Build the wall.
A wall will NOT fix our immigration system.
Protect America. Build the wall.
I love what Mr. Trump is doing !! But the shutdown is taking the wrong people paycheck. If you take the one’s who is trying to stop it paychecks they will agree to it by the end of the week!!!!
I’m proud that you are my president what a great promise you made to these people and to us your base now stand strong against Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and the rest of the demo Kratz don’t give in change the system right now and this with a victory for the good guys just for Once
They are not going to give him the Wall , he'll have to build it without them !!!
Praying for you PRESIDENT TRUMP!! Stay strong , I LOVE what you are doing!!
Love you his man, he’s fighting for us for a change 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️
Jereica Renea Kirby Could your statement be any less retarded?
Love you his man, he’s fighting for us for a change 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️
But you also said Mexico would pay for the wall not the US citizens and not spuriously through savings from the replacement for NAFTA.
Praying for you PRESIDENT TRUMP!! Stay strong , I LOVE what you are doing!!
While you use slave labor (unpaid federal employees) to corrupt our government?! No wonder you get along so well with Dictators... takes one to know one?  Birds of a feather and all? Boo for you.
Do not waiver in your position Mr. President. Stand Firm.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
You also made a promise that we would not have to pay for it!!!
I am so tired of hearing what  Nancy Pelosi has to say. You can be sure I am not on her side.
Trouble is she is not listening.
the socalist/ communist democraps.... are gonna have to build a wall dont worry.... IT IS TO KEEP US IN.....
The Almighty Creator is saying please go ahead Mr President. Your action is for the good of humanity. God bless President D. Trump.
I thought the president could build the wall without her by declaring a national emergency if so do it.
Dean A. Groetzinger humpty dumpty trump is the "greatest negotiator". That was a lie too, right?
I thought the president could build the wall without her by declaring a national emergency if so do it.
One impeachment caserole coming up.
WOW! How come you know all this?
Tunde Lakatos if he walks like a duck and he talks like a duck....for “d”ucks sake...
The Almighty Creator is saying please go ahead Mr President. Your action is for the good of humanity. God bless President D. Trump.
That is messed up. He should of never been here
Might be easier to work with Mexico’s government to build the wall. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Only REAL MEN admit when they're wrong. You've been played. But that's ok, we all have. The difference here is admitting when you're wrong, learning from it & moving on, right?        Be a man.
Build the Frigging Wall! Iraq Vet.
She wouldn't want a first-hand account of the damage her policies have caused
Hold Strong 💪 to that commitment!
I like your dad, But you Lara! You should not talk!!!!!!
God bless you President Trump.. Thank you ❤️

If nothing else, the people laughing at other’s misery and sadness, I’m not speaking for anybody else, but here’s hoping #KARMA is out and about.... Hopefully you’re gotten to in a timely manner... On another note 📝. How about that global warming Al Gore, it’s colder than House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lack taters.....
Awesome interview my prayers are on going for the families that have lost their love ones bless you all and we stand  up for our President to build the wall
I have been watching videos on OSCAR EL BLUE and Anthony facebook pages.   It makes me worry for our country.
Odd argument dems have about "drugs not coming on people's backs." They do come inside balloons in drug mule's stomach's. But on a larger scale they come on off road vehicles, going around check points, through the desert. It is a lot harder to do that if a 30 foot wall extends miles into the open sand. If you force them through check points with cameras and dogs or make them take long detours they are easier to catch.
We need the wall done.this wall is to protect American people.You can't sleep well if your home's doors are open.
Let America vote on the Wall... would sure save a lot of time, money and stop the financial heartache on our federal employees.  Let us make the decision.
Don't Give up Mr President ...I'm behind you 110%
Paul theres a dame good reason y.we cant stand trump. If u.would actually take ur.blinders off u.could see y.this man is not the president we need or want.hes nothing but a lier.and cannot be trusted ever.he lies way to much.

No Wall ! Not under your terms ! Stand strong Nancy !

Build  the wall/fence two feet tall and go home all is well now.
GOD BLESS THE FAMILY OF OFFICER MENDOZA AND ALL ANGEL FAMILIES. GOD BLESS ALL POLICE ,AMEN
If we stop giving illegals food stamps, healthcare....etc, then we will have the money to BUILD THAT WALL 🇺🇸

We want the wall  open the government
This is for  Nancy Pelosi open the Government
Best President ever.  Keep up the good work President Trump.
Why can’t trump just fire Nancy problem solved
Nancy should not even be in a position to make decisions like this. Also we should vote all of these people who is holding this up just because they don't like our president out of office....🤨🧐
Okay. First let me say that I voted for Trump and I support the  idea of building a border wall but, the story I just heard doesn't support the reason or need for a secure border. Drunk drivers have nothing to do with it.  Had that driver come to the United States legally, the driver probably would have been drunk regardless.   I apologize for any bed grammar, spelling, or punctuation.
In Germany we scold' it HEUTE SHOW
I know you will do every thing you said you would do for America and her people. God bless you Mr. President
That woman is everything but right 🙏🏻
God Bless the USA.  Thank you President Trump for making the American people come first.

Mr. President, our whole church prayed for you and your family this morning.  Thank you for what you are doing for our very ungrateful nation.  You have many supporters here in Plant City and Lakeland, Florida.  We love you and uplift you in our prayers.  Keep fighting the good fight.
I don’t understand why this is taking so long .... most home owners in America have some type of fence around their property for added protection for keeping outsiders out and family in ( animals, kids , etc. )  .... this is basically a bigger fence 🙄
your country is broken my friend and I don t think you can fix it
It will not do any good to tell Nancy any thing because she does not care what the American people want.  More than likely she has illegals working her vineyards.
Pelosi is on her way out.. just a matter of time..
Nancy and Chuck do the correct thing
Keep them all grounded til it happens

Israel has a wall and military protecting its borders. Most of the left is all about Israel first. Why not America first???

It DOESN'T matter how tall or deep the wall is.Them coyotes are smarter.We need new technology to secure our borders.
Am with your idea fighter for your share as an American .but as a great country help us also to fight for our share as citizens of our countries .
Thank you for everything you do President Trump. I have not regretted 1 day that I voted for you. Keep strong.
Use some of that money to pay staff and their family  that have not received any paychecks.
We can not jeopardize homeland security while waiting to fund the wall.  Support the homeland defense workers ,  they are our first line of protection in the U.S.   Coast Guard,  TSA....

I’m do not understand,will TPS have the permit to work after September this year?
How about if we give in to the Left and say that all the immigrants can come to America but they have to live in California or a designated sanctuary city and they will receive no federal money.  They will have to be supported by the state and city where they live.   Let the left deal with the chaos afterward, then they can't blame the President, because it's what the big babies are crying for.  Just a thought from a person who is tired of all the fighting.
You not need to change the wall for DACA stop that.  The   wall is for save the PEOPLE  from  USA  thanks Mr. President trump.
U go trump..we love what ur trying to do for our country...i speak for a lot of us....i think u need to clean the swamp. The old lady.!!!

We stand with you President #Trump and am praying for you! God bless!
Get all tech out of the hands of Zionist Israel they cannot be trusted as they are allies with Saudi Arabia via ZIonism. Get 9/11 reinvestigated now.
So I guess this means if you make all the Europeans leave there will be no more MASS SHOOTTINGS???🤔🤔🤔
Get all tech out of the hands of Zionist Israel they cannot be trusted as they are allies with Saudi Arabia via ZIonism. Get 9/11 reinvestigated now.
Thank you very much Mr. President!
Dear President Trump, Nancy is not in charge you are, she is show-boating like she owns it, SHE doesn't YOU do, We the people of elected you
Every Angel mom wishes their child was worried about paying their bills during this shutdown
If that's the case it has to be a borders to be fair, if not it's prejudice.
The Dems like Nancy Polisi and Chuck Shoemor  needs to lose there paycheck also and give there paycheck to all the people out there that aren't getting paid and just remembered that Polisi have said one thousand dollars was crumbs to most that are getting that much just to live on one week at a time or every other week , giving only a dollar isn't fair to most that Believe in the wall and other things makes us as American in this country  it's just not fair 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The Europeans are legal american citizens! STHU!
Angela Merkel makes Europe great again. EUROPE First
Damn this political stunt and the idiot followers who actually fall for this.
Thank God for President who is trying hard to keep us safe while Nancy Pelosi, et al, are putting us all at risk.
I am with you 1000percent  Mr President. YOU CAN COUNT ON ME .RECON.
Simply cannot understand why she thinks shes in charge
I can understand the need for the shutdown for such an important issue of the wall. . What I do not understand is WHY are we still paying our representatives  in Congress and the Senate, when they are not doing their job by fixing this. Maybe if they felt the heat that we the people are feeling, they would have a different outlook of what a majority of Americans deal with.  We elect and pay for our representatives whom are not doing their JOB!  They need to be FIRED. Please help if achieve this.
Dear Tump, he needs to announce it, because we need their votes for 2020 do not forget, if you do not say it, we will lose 20 million votes in 2020 we all agree algal cannot come to the U.S. but some algal been here last 20 years and they have children.

A wall is not necessay or desired.... Station our Military on all American Borders and give the order to lock n load. What part of illegal entry is not understood? Remember 9/11 and never ever forget the lives lost. The lives lost in the War on Terrorism also!
Sign the letter on the link provided!
A wall / Fence has been an  issue for decades this is the only President that has the guts to see it through
Yes to the wall! I think it's shameful of what the house is doing to our country and our leader.
damn right. we voted for you we syand behind you! go get em
https://www.kolotv.com/content/news/Murder-charges-expected-against-suspect-in-Northern-NV-murders-504626241.html  More murders by an illegal.  Mr. Trump!!
Oh, I am 61 now, and they were dealing with this before that.
You’re not doing anything noble... it’s time for you to GO!!!!
Build the wall Nancy or step down.
You’re not doing anything noble... it’s time for you to GO!!!!
Dean Andrews. Lolol No he does not? That's why we have desperation of power. To keep all in check. We live under democracy. This it's not a dictatorship country nor will it ever be. If it work as your president chump expected we wouldn't be having this conversation right now now would we
Separation of power. Sorry about that
You don’t need to apologize to trump supporters; they’re idiots, they don’t know any difference.
Well we know Donald Trump is our President not Nancy Pelosi.
Oh, I am 61 now, and they were dealing with this before that.

Nancy Pelosi please give Americans the wall and it's necessary anyways. Just do it.
Dems are all for Israel they have a wall and military protecting its border. Expose the commie traitors.
You don’t need to apologize to trump supporters; they’re idiots, they don’t know any difference.
This is one of those areas that has been left out for a long time. We have had the border conversation so long, Pelosi and the the others don’t take it seriously. I was raised in Texas and when I was 14, I walked into the girls room at school, and there were 3 Hispanic males rapping a friend at knife point. Nothing is going to change as long as someone on this side is making money. You want the wall, you get those people out of the way.
Mr President why not put down half a billion dollars for  your wall ? You have the money and you very well know America can't afford it.
Thank you, Mr. President! Build the wall!!!
I don't remember Trump pledging to starve Americans but then, as usual, he lied!
Pelosi is too scared to face the truth,,,Wimp
Open the government!!! Then do your job !!!
I voted for Trump but i need my refund!!
Dont forget your promise to Putin.
Dems are all for Israel they have a wall and military protecting its border. Expose the commie traitors.

You need to stop trying to fund so much money to have that wall built. I know it's important but not so important that we the people have to suffer for it. People are working without pay and can't pay their bills and as a result are losing their homes all because you are arguing over a stupid wall. People's lives are more important than a wall. And not being with your family on Christmas because of that isn't right either. Why can't we just all get along? Find a way for the US and Mexico to live together in peace. God created the land for all mankind to live together, not so we could fight over it. I know the opinions of one person don't matter much but I just thought I'd get out how I feel about this. Please stop fighting and think about what's best for the people for once and do what's right.
Stephanie Kay Shockley how many illegals do you want to support. Send them a check  maybe they will stay home.
Stephanie Kay Shockley He is doing what's right! He wants to keep America safe,if your kids or any loved ones were one of the many people that were killed,raped,and beaten by an illegal immigrant ,you would want the wall as well...
Stephanie Kay Shockley you are not losing your home in 30 days.get real
Raymond Mitchell But people are suffering and losing their homes and can't pay their medical bills. And building a wall won't stop people from getting killed. People get killed every day by other Americans. And the law is wrong. God wants mankind to live and work together not claim land like that. The land should belong to all mankind. And we shouldn't have to suffer just to claim land.
Renee Martinez But people are dying and suffering because of the government shutdown. I'll keep praying asking God to get him to do what's right.
Build the wall. its the only way to go God bless you and your family.
Oh gawd. Not her her again.  Just goes to show you that Trump will starve american people to get his way.  My heart goes out to her but this happens everyday by white people who drink drive and cause deaths.
In Domino game is to know to control the game blocking’s the opposite player and who gain or loss? Or in Chess game?for example.
Pelosi, get off your azz and work out a deal with the President. You're really not worth this much headache
Silly Billy gumdrops. Closing the government until you get funded? More like holding your breath until you turn blue..ya whining baby.pfft
Don't give up the faith Mr president but rather press on with your work we as a nation stand strong behind you. God bless you sir.
Renee Martinez But people are dying and suffering because of the government shutdown. I'll keep praying asking God to get him to do what's right.
Nancy get off your broom and build the wall.
https://www.instagram.com/hyconbrand/ Trump tee is here
I do not know what Nancy Pelosi really cares about but I'm certain it is NOT women and children, and it is not life, or she would not be such a proponent of abortion.  And though she claims to be Catholic, her daughter's anti-Christian films prove to me this family has no faith in God.
Keep fighting and stand strong!
Build the wall! Screw Dumocrats!
I rewrote the letter and send it.  I want the wall to stem the overwhelming tide of human trafficking, drug trafficking, and weapons, trafficking.  Our elected officials first and foremost priority should be the American People and the USA..  I do not vote party.  I am an independent.  WE NEED TERM LIMITS.
Spot in. Do include Fake news segment.
Stay strong Mr. President. When we took our oaths we signed up for all that it could entail. We deserve to fight till the end! My vote at the General Election was as such... "God almighty only He can make America Great Again! If it werent for that Id chose Trump Pence as Washington wasnt a Socialist he was an American, when we vote it is in hus honor. I am not certain any socialist can honor the late General Washington." I voted in faith, keep the faith! I never vote as everyone else, I vote to make a statement. I hope that during your time in office you not only will make a statement but stand on principle. Let us not forget to honor the man who risked his life to secure a nation. Let us continue to honor his memory! Whether Yeshuah is in an ossuary or risen he was a good rabbi remembered 2k yrs later. As we remember Yeshuahs memory we should also remember our founders! Mach a bracha!
What does government workers got to do with the wall that was to be paid for by Mexico?
Don't give up the faith Mr president but rather press on with your work we as a nation stand strong behind you. God bless you sir.

David White Eagle I will agree but demon-craps does not want any media😝.  Remember when Schumer and Pelosi had their first meeting with President Trump.  They had cameras there and the demon-craps are just cautious about how stupid they really are.😝

A friend once told me that we are all immigrants. Yes but we came through the door at Ellis Island and were documented. We came on by the rules.
Did anyone else notice that the current government shutdown started under a Republican controlled government?   The current shutdown started Dec 22 (under the old congress) and the new congress started Jan 3.  Wtf on so many levels; but wtf?
Republicans controlled  the House, Senate, & President for the last two years. Why didn’t they pass a Wall bill? NOW it’s a CRISIS! Give me a break.
Thank you President Trump!
Yeah! Doing great! I get to drop out of nursing school because of this! Way to better our futures.
all twitter members, too. they suspected me wihout 1 written tweet or one acting!
Pelosi and Schumer won't listen to Sec Nielsen's facts, won't visit the border, won't listen to actual people that do the job, we see continued caravans that are not manufactured. Irresponsible leadership failing US citizens. Fund security wall/slats, technology, border agents, judges, beds that are needed and get people back to work.
Nancy: Vote to fund the wall. #BUILDTHEWALL !!!!!!!!!!!!

Lenny Anders trump is trying to tote this "solution" as a cure to the problem america has with 67 billion a year in drugs or more coming over the border. He's trying to say it is going to slow illegal immigrants. It will not help. The wall in isreal did not help with terrorism it stopped regular people from crossing into their territory's. You know what did help, having America spend 38 billion on isreals military and other operations in the region. You sit there pretending you know why people stopped trying to bomb isreal its more likely because if you approach the fence and try to climb over you could be met with LETHAL force. If you intend on killing refugees and people seeking work in your country then maybe numbers will drop.

Screw Pelosi if she had a brain she would be dangerous
Tell  House LeaderNancey Polosi your fired
dont give in to them Mr president. We are behind you
All true and loyal Americans that love our country want the wall! This is the highest priority for the safety of all Americans. The fight has not been about a wall as we all know, it all about attempting to derail any progress President Trump is making. The speaker of the house is not a person that is capable of perfecting any of us and will always be an obstructionist to secure this country!
Go Trump Nancy and Cryin Chuck Schumer have been in office for over two decades and never got it done get her done
Cheryl Lynn WHAT?

OMG, how insanely ridiculous is it that a US president would create his own media network to spread his foul propaganda? Worse, how incredibly gullible and stupid do you have to be to fall for this crap? Good thing less than a third of the population is this ignorant. Still, that's too many.

Wow, Nancy and her holier than thou self is so concerned about the employees not getting paid, she just told news reporters in reference to Trumps offer that she in so many words is off work today and won't discuss on her personal precious time.You go ole Nancy!!!
You lie every day. Nobody trusts you. Open the government, then resign for the good of our country.
Check into Nancy Pelosi travel expenses account to see if there maybe any accountability crimes this is a must since her trip was grounded.....Impeach Nancy and Chuck
No DACA deals...stand your ground Mr.President.....don’t reward illegals with citizenship for breaking our laws.......if you bend on this you will cave to the dems.Build that wall without them.....everyone has a sob story so don’t listen to the propaganda from these law breaking migrants
Walls dont work.  https://www.facebook.com/799169742/posts/10157014538474743/
You all can not do a damn thing about it but twiddle your thumbs as long as politician and Democrats need Shady votes they will keep getting away with it the reason President Donald Trump can't do a damn thing about it, it's because the house has control over what people can say and do and what they can vote for not the people and not the presidentthe legalization of recreational marijuana could be used could pay for the wall

Apparently you made a stronger pledge to Putin to destroy our country.  #AgentOrange #RussianAsset
Ron Lammardo put the pipe down you stupid hippie!!
Excellent points from Marianne. So sorry for your loss and many other losses due to the criminals that are coming over the Border. The Democrats have destroyed our freedom and our safety because of their selfishness and their lust for money. President Trump is fighting very hard to make things better and safer for us and expose the Democrats for who they really are.... Heartless Liars who just want their power and their money back. Our United States is not their personal piggy bank. We must be strong and safe and United the way we used to be. Many thanks to President Donald Trump! ❤
When all fails lie,lie,lie ....Democrats memo .
Use me as a dislike for democrats.  TRUMP2020
Great president in recent history we support you and we stand with you Donald Trump 🙏💪💪💪
There ain’t gonna be no damn trump wall, so get over it!
PRESIDENT TRUMP: What would happen if you met with AMLO and figured out a way to Make Mexico Magnificent, giving them incentive to stay in their own country and giving immigrants from other countries an alternative to the US. I had no idea Mexico was so desperate until I read this!!! IN-FRICKIN-SANE!!!  C&P from an article, reporting the recent catastrophe,  I read this morning:  "The tragedy comes as Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador -- known as "AMLO," who took office in December -- has vowed to eradicate fuel thieves who illegally drilled taps into pipelines an estimated 12,581 times during the first 10 months of 2018, an average of about 42 violations per day.
Build that Wall President Trump! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Our president is amazing. All that oppose him are running scared. We will prevail. We will get border security and hopefulley deport millions in the process.
OPEN OUR GOVERNMENT or nothing can be accomplished!       BLACKMAIL is unacceptable!
Ron Lammardo put the pipe down you stupid hippie!!
Mr president, declare the emergency and build the wall. It won’t be political suicide. It will only strengthen your position and make the democrats think twice about not playing nice!!!
Yeah you're really fixing it all right
READ MY LIPS: I will take the blame for shutting the government down. Mexico will pay for the wall. I won't blame you Chuck for closing the government.
You made a promise to provide your taxes and what about that affordable healthcare for everyone - you probably never kept a promise your entire life
Stop the democrat shutdown now. Build the wall!
If the House and Senate worked as hard as The President, think of all the important things hat could get done.
What, you're status as an angel depends on the race of your murderer?
ALL YOU WANT IS CHAOS AND SPECTACLE
Hey, Chuck & Nancy pls. stop playing hardball & let the border wall be done, after all the wall is for the safety of us Americans !
You promised MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR THE WALL. NOT AMERICANS.
How many people have to tell you that your “one size fits all” vanity project won’t work? We need people and technology to monitor the border, not a wall.
Mr President do you need congressional permission to “repair” the fence ? Can you use emergency funds to “REPAIR” the fence and fill in the gaps ?
ONLY SOCIALISTS BUILD WALLS.
Nancy and Chucky let Trump get the Border Wall built and now 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
End Trump Shutdown immediately
NO WALL!!  There is NO crisis at the border!!!  CIty officials of border towns deny there is a crisis  This is ALL made up by YOU! Just MORE lies so you can pander to your base of UN-educated cult followers
Why don't you make a pledge to all families affected by gun violence?
ALL YOU WANT IS CHAOS AND SPECTACLE

Dear America and World: I have read before and I think it is still going on: Russia has been infusing the United States and other Countries with false information, propaganda and Lies through the internet and other media outlets for the past 6 years at least. They have had goals for over 20 years now to shape the geopolitical world into their image and lately, it seems Donald Trump has been obeying mass-murderer Putin's orders!

So sad that trump supporters are filled with hatred and fear of others. They support a man who lies and is morally bankrupt. Sad.
"There are some things in our nation and in our world to which I’m proud to be maladjusted… I never intend to adjust myself to segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few, and leave millions of people perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of prosperity.  I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, and to the self-defeating effects of physical violence…  And I call upon you to be maladjusted to these things until the good society is realized…" --- Martin Luther King Jr.
Donald J. Trump, why would you be willing to make a deal to put 800,000+ useless government employees back on the payroll?  These folks and what they do are pointless.  If you really want to make significant changes start with eliminating all of these folks from government and end the income tax/stealing.
Instead of a wall, why not build sniper towers every mile. Anyone that comes within 100M of the border gets sniped. How many do you think you will have to kill before they get the message? I’m sure be lots people,that would man the towers.
I <3 My President ! Thank you for fighting for the AMERICAN people! #BUILDTHEWALL

Nancy read and reflect the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th.  Then I,m sure you will have No Problem meeting with the Angel Moms and the President.  In keeping with the 3rd. Call upon The Lord to give your soul guidance not your Party today.  Praying for Everyone today that this effects!  Praying for our Nation today!

Jereica Renea Kirby  thousands died from no health insurance and the GOP do nothing
Do not back down on the wall.
Please Mr. President do not cave or give illegals any status or benefits. Do not betray our trust!
Poor Jr. High "mean girl" Nancy and her coharts, Diane, Maxine and others have the Dem. men so bullied that they cannot think for themselves.  Otherwise, the men would step up and do the right thing.  They all have voted  yes for these issues so many times before. What a waste of good minds.
I have lost any respect that I have had for you!  It is not about you politicians---it is about securing my country.  I resent you snd have zero respect for your self-serving party.
angels are the best!! Go Trump What the hell is wrong with Demacraps I don't understand!
Why a wall?If a bigger problem seems 2 be underground?
Sell California to Mexico for 5 Billion and build the wall.  It solves Two problems...

Its good no think he Indian view this these Indians are real black eyeonthese all setelite
If anyone tells you that walls do not work, they are liars!
Thank you President Trump for fighting for the victims of illegal immigration and supporting their families. Illegal immigration hurts all of American society.
No amnesty, no anchor babies, deportation of illegals (start with the JAILS); no CHAIN, no job visas that replace American workers, JUST NO BULL to get cheap labor !
Nancy needs to be put to sleep old dog
too late for our Zionist's occupied government! enemies already in.
We need an open fire policy at the border.
Secure the border Mr. President.
Good stand firm to pull down the strong holds
I’m guessing none of you are government employees not getting paid
Build the wall, change the immigration laws and let us get back to a government that can listen to the people who elect them not the lobbyists.
This statement true but also need to eye scant use other setelite broadcasting e.g Indian province , much sordid state radio akasvani broadcasting by these have habit to quarel to borders houses departments out all as consitution whichno long remain will be , leaders yold side media departments side understand be this ,
you guys do realize that our borders are getting less safe everyday the shutdown continues 🤨🤨
Morning Donald now support my movement BILLY G for life
I wish Donald Trump would get the same thing that Martin Luther King jr. Got he deserves it
Breaking news from the American Patriots League a recent survey among them, true American Patriots, unlike Trump the traitor are 78.98% in favor of a firing squad at the Allamo where Trumpski, bone spur champion, is the guest of honor

Hei Man dont atacc to Venezuela OK dont ataac this os very dangeuos
Patrick Sciarratta, it NEVER was 42-49% as an average. The highest average Trump had was 43.3% and today it’s 41.4%, or a drop of about 2% from the high, which is still within any real margin of error.  There is NO 7 point drop! Even on this one, economist has a high of 45 and even if you took his all time high of 49 would make this one a 4 point difference, not 7
Patrick Sciarratta, there you go! You took a single polling entity and compared it to another single polling entity to create your skewed statistic. But if one wanted to be more ethical, they would have simply compared the average of all polling over one time period to another and saw the results. For you, it was never about being truthful, just to pervert polling to your advantage
Patrick Sciarratta, you indicated Trump is seeing a 7 point drop in about 45 or so days, which is a very misleading statistic. Polling is best extrapolated over long periods of time to obtain a true representative sample of enough data.   In December 2017, Trump had an average approval rating of 37% and it slowly increased to a high of about 43.3 in about April 2018 or so. Since that high, Trump has been his numbers fluctuate between a low of 41% to a high of nearly 44%. Statistically speaking, since the shutdown was imminent, Trump has lost about 1.3% to date   However, congress as a whole has taken a hit as well. They had an average between 19.8% to a high of about 20.7 in the same 6 - 8 month time frame as Trump. Today their approval is at 19.3, or about a loss of around 0.6 - 0.8%, or about half of Trump’s loss   But the shutdown doesn’t affect Trump nearly as bad as if he capitulated to Pelosi and Schumer. For if he did, he would lose many of his base sooner. Therefore he would have lost followers regardless. But as long as voters are lowering congress as well, at least he isn’t the only one taking a hit.
If you intend to compromise about DACA, to extend their privilege to stay here, Homeland security should charge $1,000.00 each for the application.And also $1,000.00  for TPS. Homeland security will be able to fund the wall with their revenues. Over 10 billion dollars. And you can say Mexicans pay .
Fake News. Put the Federal worker back to work president Trump!
i stand with our great POTUS and the American people and this country !! BUILD THE WALL  ! or we will take action on our own ! and then you will be voted out !
Ok TRUMP SHOW ME HOW TO EAT WITH FORK NIFE SALAD AND WHY PINKY
Reduce whole SALE cost in produce if we use our own PRODUCTS  farming

Get Russia to help. Theyve helped you out a lot.
DONALD TRUMP IS A TERRORIST... a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
Trade a future Supreme Court nominee for the Wall. Schumer would drool at the offer and the rest of the dems would start turning on each other.
AND so many American children have been killed by other Americans. The loss of a child or family member at the hands of another is devasting for all donald. Your point?
If you don't support Veterans that's your business in this free country. If you protest them? Remember I am one of them. My rights matter too and I know a lot more than you.
Keep fighting Mr. President, contrary to the news reports, there are a lot of us fighting with you!
If you don't support Veterans that's your business in this free country. If you protest them? Remember I am one of them. My rights matter too and I know a lot more than you.

Maybe Nancy we used to buy some dope from them people
Everyday I wake up hoping you died in your sleep. If only you would end this horrible nightmare and make America great again
Nancy Pelosi will prob get me investigated by fake Russian Investigation Mueller for wanting a wall!
I know this is NOT fake News! In the News today!😲 Shocking News! Nancy Pelosi is not a strong woman. She just has groping hands 😲😲😲
SOS   Scientific breakthrough   We no longer live in a 3 dimensional world  But a flat prospective having 2 dimensional vision with 3 dimensional forms  Meaning we live in 2.5 dimension
I am confused, we are to accept that people die when they serve our country, that is the price we pay, right, accept it. But when it come to the wall, which is for our protection, we are suppose to feel sorry for someone who misses a paycheck, or waits a little long for anything.
Bullshit. The only way for Trump to fix anything is to resign.

John Sindall or they would have committed “suicide”
Build it! Tired of screwing around. Just build it!

Pelosi is being exposed for the obstructionist hateful person she is... Her hate for president Trump overrides any real concern she has if any... Wish we could stop paying these people
Susan J Soler WHAT?
I feel sorry for your child being brought up by such a troubled person. Inbreeding I'm guessing.
Linda Marciano it's hate speak like this that proves my point... Appreciate that..now ssshhh
What would Hillary Clinton do today about the caravan invasions if she was president?  Nothing.
Sending a letter to Nancy is a bad idea. I do not want my name address & email spread all over the internet and I do not choose to receive unsolicited email from political organizations or causes. Declare a national emergency and build the wall without congress. You are the boss so make an executive decision and get the job done Mr. President.
Thank you President Trump, don't give up. We need you. May God be with you.
Keep your promises to protect the 2nd amendment  States are all infringing on our rights do something about it .. keep your promises

Sad what plan have Democrats made for border security? Why don’t fake news tell us democrats plan for border security? There is no plan and democrats and fake news are working against Americans. Democrats always voted for wall they just don’t vote for funding . Fake news don’t report that fact.

Real News: Since this was printed a new poll shows his support even lower today ...  SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT IS HIGHER THAN HIS APPROVAL RATING, NEW POLL SHOWS  BY TIM MARCIN  Will Donald Trump Be Impeached?  President Donald Trump isn't exactly popular right now. In fact, a new poll shows that more people seem to support impeaching him than approve of the job he's doing.   The survey from Public Policy Polling—a Democratic polling company that also does public polls—pegged Trump's approval rating at just 40 percent, while 57 percent disapproved. Forty-six percent of voters, meanwhile, supported impeaching Trump, while just 44 percent are opposed, according to the poll.  The survey polled 760 registered voters from January 19 through 21. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.  The survey also pitted Trump against hypothetical Democratic opponents for the 2020 election to see where things stood. Trump trailed all seven likely Democratic candidates that the company used: former Vice President Joe Biden (53 percent to 41 percent), Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (51 percent to 41 percent), California Senator Kamala Harris (48 percent to 41 percent), former Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke (47 percent to 41 percent), Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (48 percent to 42 percent), New Jersey Senator Cory Booker (47 percent to 42 percent) and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (47 percent to 42 percent).  "It really doesn’t matter which Democratic hopeful you test against him right now," said Dean Debnam, president of Public Policy Polling, in a statement. "Voters prefer any of them over Trump at halftime of his Presidency." - Newsweek
You made fun of the slaughter that took place at Wounded Knee of Native American Indians you POS. Do me a favor and say something about Italians. I beg of you.
Who’s going to pay for the Wall, MEXICO come on yell it Trump Supporters
I agree we need stronger borders but I would really like to go back to work and take care of my family.   This is getting stupid and it is endangering a lot of people financially.
Saying things like Angel moms over and over works just as well as saying Sandy Hook and Parkland over and over. people only want what they want.
I agree, must fix system and secure our borders but please open government for the American people. Deal with her Pelosi  later. Americans need their jobs and income. Most are not looking favorably at shut down. Hurting too many families. Forget pride and help our CITIZENS. Please end the shutdown, looks bad for you and party.
thanks for info

I say give pamphlets of towns and address of all those opposed to the wall to those coming over without proper papers. and they can put up tents and campers for them in there front and backyards. I think that would be a nice jester. While I put a wall around my place guarded by pit bulls german shepherds 30-06 and a Glock 9.

My Client Resigned From the White House. It's Time for Trump to Think About His Children and Do the Same  Impeachment should be far from the President's only concern By Martin London (VP Spiro T Agnew’s attorney, back in the day)  The BuzzFeed report that former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has told investigators that, after the election, President Trump instructed him to lie to Congress has raised new calls for impeachment. But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen’s testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions “internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents”) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family — specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. — knew the details of Cohen’s secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as “deep involvement” in the discussions with Russia — a subject they’ve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had “extensive discussions” with the family members. The outlet’s two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them “very detailed updates.” If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump’s firm support in the Senate — which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House — dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President’s immediate concern is Mueller. This is not like Trump firing of then–FBI Director James Comey, which lawyers can challenge because it was technically within the President’s constitutional power to do so for any reason, good or bad. This is conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony. There can be no argument that the President has the Constitutional authority to conspire to, say, cause somebody to rob a bank — or commit any other felony, such as giving perjurious testimony concerning the President’s conduct.  Don’t forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex–campaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President’s power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer — and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?  At some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment. The longer the President waits, the more evidence piles up, and the tougher it will be to get a deal. Mueller already has a federal grand jury hearing evidence that just received a six-month extension. The President should make his deal before that body completes its work. The Mueller report may accompany a clutch of Mueller indictments.

I'm sorry you still believe in a man proven to be immoral (not just adultery but scamming workers from their pay and much more), rude, disrespectful to our men and women in service and veterans; a man with the demeanor of an angry spoiled child who happily watches people having to go to food banks, some even putting their homes up for sale, because this man, this one you still believe in, will not accept what has ALREADY been offered in a bipartisan offering to add to the billion he hasn't spent yet on border security. This is a TEMPER TANTRUM! Do you have children? Would you let all the other children suffer because of the actions of one? And yet you believe in him still. That brings into question either your own morality or your intelligence, not something I can know. But you do. and also? He's just not a smart person.

Did you ever think why Democrats don’t want to build the wall, it’s not because they want to bring illegal immigration and help them , their personal agenda is to bring illegal immigration to get and keep the power in the White House they don’t really work for the American people they work for their own personal agenda.  if you want to see a difference don’t forget to support Donald J Trump on election time 2020
Like now
Our President is a brilliant political strategist. He just pushed the Democrats into a corner and there’s no way out for them that doesn’t end up w/ egg on their face and a big beautiful wall up on the border.
President Trump should keep the government closed for as long as possible so he can focus the media’s attention on the question of border security. Once the government reopens, for sure it will do nothing other than mouthing ‘impeachment’. It should stay closed.
I guess since they don't suit your agenda the families of mass shootings are stuck with nothing but thoughts and prayers?  What a complete phony.

By and large, border towns do NOT want this stupid, expensive and USELESS wall.   They say it daily (read below) and most Texans have agreed to file a class action lawsuit against Emperor Fullofshiticus if he ever tries eminent domain. Following is an excerpt from today’s news:   ‘It’s Not a Wall,’ but Steel Slats and Barbed Wire Roil a Border Town  By Jose A. Del Real Jan. 23, 2019 CALEXICO, Calif. — The barbed wire overhead evokes danger and violence, but Maritza Hurtado cannot take it seriously. When the sharp coils were placed on top of the old border fence several months ago, running right along the main boulevard, she chalked it up to political propaganda from a White House that does not understand life along the Southwest frontier.  “This is not a war zone,” Ms. Hurtado said from her tax and immigration consulting office in downtown Calexico, from which she can peer into Mexico. “I’ve had a business here for 30 years and we’ve never needed the barbed wire. Why now? To me, it feels as if I’m enclosed.”  For nearly a year, President Trump has pointed with pride to a renovation project replacing two miles of border fencing in Calexico. He hailed it as “the start of our Southern Border WALL!” — to the great consternation of many of the town’s residents, who are wary of becoming the public face of a hard-line immigration policy that most here do not agree with. The attention the president’s tweet brought was surreal, in part because the construction replaced an unsightly stretch of steel fencing that was already there.  Nationally, partisans and journalists began to debate whether the 30-foot-tall steel slats that make up the replacement barrier should be called a “wall” like the one Mr. Trump promised during his campaign. Others said it was just a “fence,” a distinction that has taken on great importance in Washington.  Lost amid the battle over credit and semantics was how Calexico residents themselves felt about becoming characters in Trump-era political theater. For many, a sense of apprehension turned to anger when the military installed barbed wire on top of older border fencing, which runs through downtown.  “This community is basically being used for political purposes,” said Ms. Hurtado, who served as the town’s mayor until December. “And it’s happening throughout these border cities that are just like ours.” She tried to remain diplomatic when television news crews asked her for comment about the barrier last spring, she said, to “avoid making more drama for this community that has nothing to do with the national problem.”
When you take care of your own Russian oligarch FRIENDS and ignore the desperate plight of 800,000 workers and their families ...  Document shows Trump, GOP sanctions lift a boon to Deripaska: NYT/Ken Vogel “Contrary to the insistence of the Trump administration, lifting sanctions on oligarch Oleg Deripaska's companies benefits him tremendously.”  Once again, Russia trumps the USA in the mind and heart of a traitor.

Watched a fascinating program about you recently
For Discussion: Will the Traitor-In-Chief finally destroy the Repugnant Party from Within?  Read, then Discuss: From WAPO - ‘This is your fault’: GOP senators clash over shutdown in private luncheon Republican senators clashed with one another and confronted Vice President Pence inside a private luncheon on Thursday, as anger hit a boiling point over the longest government shutdown in history.  “This is your fault,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) at one point, according to two Republicans who attended the lunch and witnessed the exchange.  “Are you suggesting I’m enjoying this?” McConnell snapped back, according to the people who attended the lunch.  Johnson spokesman Ben Voelkel confirmed the confrontation. He said Johnson was expressing frustration with the day’s proceedings — votes on dueling plans to reopen the government, both of which failed to advance.  The people who attended the lunch spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a closed-door session. Aides to McConnell, citing regular policy on GOP lunches, declined to comment on the gathering.  The argument was one of several heated moments in a lunch that came just before the Senate voted on the opposing plans to end the shutdown offered by President Trump and Democrats.  The outbursts highlighted the toll the shutdown has taken on Republican lawmakers, who are dealing with growing concerns from constituents and blame from Democrats, all while facing pressure from conservatives to stand with Trump in his demand for money to build a wall on the border with Mexico.  The votes the Senate cast on Thursday were the first on the shutdown since it began Dec. 22, with McConnell and other GOP lawmakers previously refusing to vote on anything this year unless it had Trump’s approval — a policy that has drawn widespread criticism.  The day ended with some limited signs of progress. After the votes, McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) engaged in a face-to-face negotiation that senators hoped would lead to a solution in the near future.  The first proposal, which Trump put forward, would have allocated $5.7 billion for wall funding in exchange for temporary protections for some immigrants. Only one Democrat voted for it. Two Republicans rejected the plan.  Note for Bonus Points Discussion: More Repugnant Congresspersons voted for the Democratic Plan than the one advanced by Emperor Fullofshiticus.  Fact.
Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are a disgrace to America.
Put the people back to work no pay Congress the Senate the president  don’t pass no law put the people back to work thank you

#رسالة استغاثة من اهالي البصرة الى رئيس الولايات المتحدة الامريكية ترامب...الترجمة في الاسفل... A message of distress from the people of Basra province to the President of the United States of America. Trump respectable.  We are the people of Basra province. We ask you to rescue our province of Basra from the Militias  Gangs who have been stealing the oil of Basrah since 2003 and to this day, they are sending it to Iran and to the terrorist organizations that fund them with weapons. We have been carrying out large demonstrations against these gangs, but they respond to us with repression, torture, murder and assassination. We lack the simplest means of living, such as water and electricity. We demand reforms and appointments for the unemployed youth, many of them graduates and holders of higher diplomas, but the armed groups monopolize appointments for themselves and their parties and gangs. They are killing all those who speak a word and stand against them and they take the presidential palaces in the province of Basra, a place known to the Iraqis, and in the recent demonstrations have fired live bullets at the demonstrators and killed many innocent young people who claim their right, and the assassination of civilian activists In front of their homes and in the streets and markets, We are asking your presence to intervene quickly to rescue us from these dirty armed gangs. We know that the US military has entered Iraq and we welcome this very welcome because we believe that the US military has the ability to rescue Basra, Iraq and Iraqis from these gangs. We hope you will receive this message and respond. Because you are the only hope now for all Iraqis. Thank you Mr. Trump.

As a mother who lost her child at the hands of failed immigration policies, I know just how important border security is to American families.  I watched my son, Javier Vega, Jr., gunned down by two illegal aliens who viciously ambushed our family while we were on a fishing trip in Texas.  Javier served his country as both a Border Patrol Agent and a U.S. Marine, but he spent his last moments bravely defending my family from these ruthless animals.  Any mother who has lost a child in this way can attest that there is nothing more gut-wrenching than knowing that their sacrifice was entirely avoidable.  Politicians had neglected their responsibility to keep my son safe by ignoring our country’s desperate need for immigration reform for decades.  Three years ago, Donald Trump gave new hope to every American family like mine that has lost a loved one at the hands of illegal aliens who never should have been allowed into the country in the first place. “I hear you, I see you, and I will never let you down,” he promised us.  Since then, President Trump has never wavered from his promise to protect our families by building a wall on the southern border.  When the media ignored us, he listened. When the politicians mocked us, he comforted us.  Because he understood how failed immigration policies destroyed our families, he brought our stories to the forefront of the public consciousness and fought tirelessly to make our plight known.  President Trump gave a voice to Javier and the countless others whose lives were taken by illegal immigrants, and I am forever grateful to him for that.  But Javier’s story is just one of many that never made the headlines and likely would have gone unheard and unaddressed if not for the President’s unrelenting commitment to fix our broken system.  That’s why it’s so important to see this fight through to the end. We cannot let another child become collateral damage of the reckless open-border agenda.  Of all the promises President Trump has made and followed through on, fixing our broken immigration system is the most important.  In my home state of Texas alone, over a quarter million criminal aliens have been arrested and charged with over 600,000 crimes in just the past seven years.  My family paid the ultimate price for the failed immigration policies that allowed these crimes to happen, and I owe it to my son to demand accountability from the elected officials whose indifference cost him his life.  I am not alone. The majority of Americans overwhelmingly oppose illegal immigration and want a safer country. That’s why we elected Donald Trump to be our President.  He’s always had our backs, and now we want him to know that we have his.  President Trump, now more than ever, we support you in your battle to resolve our border crisis before more American families experience the tragedy mine has had to endure.  Marie Vega is a proud mother of two sons who served in the US Marine Corps. One was Border Patrol Agent Javier “Harvey” Vega Jr. and the other is mineral well engineer, Jordy Vega. She works as a bookkeeper at a local law firm.

Since then, President Trump has never wavered from his promise to protect our families by building a wall on the southern border.  When the media ignored us, he listened. When the politicians mocked us, he comforted us.  Because he understood how failed immigration policies destroyed our families, he brought our stories to the forefront of the public consciousness and fought tirelessly to make our plight known.  President Trump gave a voice to Javier and the countless others whose lives were taken by illegal immigrants, and I am forever grateful to him for that.  But Javier’s story is just one of many that never made the headlines and likely would have gone unheard and unaddressed if not for the President’s unrelenting commitment to fix our broken system.  That’s why it’s so important to see this fight through to the end. We cannot let another child become collateral damage of the reckless open-border agenda.  Of all the promises President Trump has made and followed through on, fixing our broken immigration system is the most important.  In my home state of Texas alone, over a quarter million criminal aliens have been arrested and charged with over 600,000 crimes in just the past seven years.  My family paid the ultimate price for the failed immigration policies that allowed these crimes to happen, and I owe it to my son to demand accountability from the elected officials whose indifference cost him his life.  I am not alone. The majority of Americans overwhelmingly oppose illegal immigration and want a safer country. That’s why we elected Donald Trump to be our President.  He’s always had our backs, and now we want him to know that we have his.  President Trump, now more than ever, we support you in your battle to resolve our border crisis before more American families experience the tragedy mine has had to endure.

I'm telling Pelosi, and anyone else who's in ear-shot, FUND BORDER SECURITY.  DON"T FUND THE WALL!
you can't keep your promises. You LIE about everything. People don't believe anything you say. The wall will  never be fully funded. Access to the land necessary to build the wall will never be available. You have FAILED. Deal with it.

Saudi King has ties to Israel via ZIonism. Get 9/11 reinvestigated.
Angela Maria how will the wall fail to stop illegals. Yes, a few will get through, but right now, you can just walk up to an imaginary line and toss your unwanted child into another country.  OUR children and young women are also taken across that line and sold into slavery. So, tell us, oh wise one, why the wall won't stop people?  Do the walls in your house not reduce your access to entries and exits?

I feel terrible for these families and I also feel terrible for families that lost their children just because they went to school...there is a gun crisis in this country and that needs addressing...the wall wont do anything to prevent illegals, get real
What are you doing for the families of mass shooting? There is more of need for that than immigration.
Shouldn't the priority be to build a wall around Bowling Green to stop another massacre?  Alternative Facts -Kellyanne Conway  White lies -Hope Hicks  Truth isn't Truth -Giuliani

Go complain to Frau Merkel.. the distroyer of Europe!o
This is why I consider Trump someone who you can discuss with: he stopped Merkel! I didn't want to live in Germany and n e v e r would have voted for that bitch. But living in Germany also shows the wrong a wall can do...it's the reason we had (  thanks God h a d ) Merkel for so long who comes from behind the wall ( - a - w a l l ..- ) and therefor never learned to tell an X from a U! )
If you consider Merkel as the one who splits the country you attribute more importance to her than she deserves!

Brent Robinson You are so wrong. I feel sorry for you
Brent Robinson you don’t care about people dying to fucking moron so just stop it. If you did you’d be petitioning for more gun control or less wars or action on climate change. But you aren’t doing that are you? No. What you care about is stopping brownish colored people from entering the country because you’re a xenophobic asshole.
Brent Robinson biggest tax scam for corporations and the wealthy... proven fact...

Brent: All Trump supporters should work for free during the shutdown, just like the 800k federal workers Trump didn’t mention. Put your money where your mouth is!
Remember the 2020 census is also coming up.  The mofe illegals that are her may be counted and can change congressional lines to favor liberals.

Brent Robinson  Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S.

Brent Robinson  They don’t care how many people die? Where are you getting your information from Brent?  They?  Who are they? They can’t allow to keep fulfilling his campaign promises?  What are you talking about?  trump has had two years time and the support of both houses and he couldn’t get his promised wall built. Neither has he collected the funds he promised he would from Mexico.  The state of trump’s approval is all down to himself and no one else.  Those who oppose trump are not traitors Brent, they simply think he is not fit for office.
Brent Robinson , Do you feel the same way about gun control so that there aren't  ANY  MORE mass shootings but because it done by WHITE AMERICANS LET THEM KEEP HAPPENING,
Brent Robinson He should have started in 2017 when the republicans were the majority he wouldn’t be playing the blame game,
Carol Wolfgram Yeah -- approval rating 🙄 . How was his approval rating when he won 306 -227 in 2016  ?-- no chance as I remember 😎 . ( oh .. and don't start with the 'popular vote' bs --  we go by the Constitution in this country ).
The Washington Post is the most left wing nut job paper in the country and the supposed data they have conjured up is not based in fact. Sorry for those who point to the Post as a source. Please grasp the truth of this. Any crime by an illegal is way way to many. To make it worse is the idea you would defend the idea that illegals have some right to murder American and get a pass from the rest of us. You are some kind of nut job all by yourself.

Colby Chavez  6. Exiting from the Paris climate accord: As a candidate, Trump promised to “cancel” the Paris Climate Agreement, a pact by nearly 200 nations to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change. Former President Barack Obama used his power as president to join the agreement without a vote in the legislature. Trump announced in June 2017 that the U.S. was pulling out of the agreement.
Sheila Lessing - Did I?
Brent Robinson his campaign promise was that Mexico would pay for the wall.
Brent Robinson  Brent, two questions,   1. who admitted that he owned the shutdown mantle?  2. Why should a wall be built that 67% of Americans CLEARLY DON’T WANT.  Why should two thirds be held hostage to one third?  Please answer these two questions without name calling or deflections?
Frank Drebin, that’s not true! In 12/17, it was 37%. Now its 41.4%.
John Bentley Stop using this old joke! 🤣🤣🤣😭😭
Rudy's claim that Trump, if he spoke to Cohen, spoke only about Cohen's impending testimony—which *Trump had no reason to disbelieve*—is a *nonsense*. Cohen spoke to Trump *ten times* about the Trump-Rozov deal. Trump *knew* whether Cohen's planned testimony was going to be true.

America great again!! So, are you giving America back 2 native Indian Americans? I do commend you.
Christina Maschmeyer, I wouldn’t say there is that type of disparity, but due to the Trump supporters who remain silent each and every week, I’d think it could be mote around the 2-4% range.

The Dems will NOT compromise with anything, President Trump has presented, so it's time to declare a National Security Emergency!!
There is no emergency except for an agent of Russia in the White House.

Don Januszewski the native american man put himself into that situation ALL BY HIMSELF. The kids WERE NOT bothering him at all. He ever n said it that HE instigated the whole situation. So thus just proves to me that HE IS A LIER AND A SHOULD BE TRUSTED. Also tge kid didn't block him and he was just standing there. My advice there is always 2 sides of the story.

Real News: On Saturday night, Breitbart panned Mr. Trump’s latest idea with the headline “Three-Year Amnesty, Most of Border Remains Open.”  In Trump’s Immigration Announcement, a Compromise Snubbed All Around  President Trump offered on Saturday to trade temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for border wall funding.  By Julie Hirschfeld Davis Jan. 19, 2019 WASHINGTON — Immigrant advocates denounced it as cruel. The conservative right howled that it was amnesty.  What President Trump billed on Saturday as a compromise to end the country’s longest government shutdown pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs to strike a deal nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall.  Instead, in offering temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for funding for a wall, Mr. Trump did something rarely seen during his presidency. He tried to reach beyond his base of supporters — which polls have begun to show is losing patience with him as the partial shutdown drags into its fifth week — and speak to a broader swath of Americans.  The Saturday afternoon speech from the West Wing was an attempt by Mr. Trump to, at the very least, shift the narrative of the past several weeks and show that rather than spoiling for a longer shutdown fight or making unreasonable demands, he was looking for a broadly acceptable way out of a morass he once boasted he was proud to wade into.  “I think you could tell by the president’s remarks today,” Vice President Mike Pence said, “that we’re reaching out.”  Yet in seeking to inch toward the center, Mr. Trump alienated portions of his hard-right base, the core supporters he most depends on and the group he and his closest aides have most feared losing. That raised the possibility that, in his zeal to get out of an intractable situation, he may have landed himself in the worst of all worlds, without a clear solution or the support of his most ardent followers.  The tensions and anger over the policy have been quietly playing out in the West Wing as well, as Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, fended off Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda. Mr. Kushner has long been a proponent of protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, while Mr. Miller has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration.  In recent days, as White House officials had been working out the details of the compromise, Mr. Miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity.  While the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that protected those illegally brought to the United States as children, Mr. Trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700,000 who are enrolled.  Mr. Kushner conceded in a briefing after the president’s speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the DACA program, which Mr. Trump moved to rescind in 2017.  “At this moment in time,” Mr. Kushner said, “this is a good path forward.”  Many conservatives did not share that view.  “Trump proposes amnesty,” the conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Twitter. “We voted for Trump and got Jeb!” she added, referring to Jeb Bush, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status.  Still, in the eyes of many White House officials, the prospect that Mr. Trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure Democrats to end the impasse was worth trying. Mr. Pence argued on Saturday that the speech was a “sincere effort” by Mr. Trump to break the logjam, and he and other White House officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist Democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with Republicans.  But such a coalition did not appear to be forming, and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention, eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak-kneed capitulation.  The vast majority of Democrats knocked the approach. While many of them have pressed for measures to protect DACA recipients and immigrants living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe, most regard the proposal he put forth on Saturday as woefully inadequate. It offers only three years of protections for the DACA recipients and those who hold T.P.S., which the Trump administration has also moved to end for several countries.  “This is not an amnesty bill,” Mr. Pence said. “There is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal.”  That was high on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s list of reasons to call the plan “unacceptable.”  That is unlikely to matter to the president. Despite saying publicly last month that he would be proud to own a shutdown over the wall, and privately displaying confidence that his base would stick with him through the fight, Mr. Trump has been dismayed to find otherwise in recent days.  An NPR poll released last week showed Mr. Trump’s approval ratings down and the first cracks in backing among critical supporters, including whites without a college education and white evangelicals.  Such pressure from what he has called the forgotten men and women who elected him and chant “Build! The! Wall!” at his arena rallies has swayed Mr. Trump before, including last year, when the conservative news site Breitbart branded him “Amnesty Don” for considering a similar deal that would have provided $25 billion in wall funding for a path to legal status for those the DACA program was created to help. The president ultimately abandoned that agreement, concerned about angering his base and after Mr. Miller and others advised him he should insist on additional immigration restrictions.
Time to call a national emergency 🚨   We will end up fighting these people no matter what route you take. Time to quite stringing people along and build the wall.

FOX News Update. President Trump reported in an exclusive interview that he has made a deal with Dear Leader Kim on the border wall. In exchange for removing all troops from Korea, Kim agreed to send 10,000 North Korean dissident workers and three boatloads of steel slats to build the  Wall. Government opens back up on Tuesday.
The American people can see that when you had house power, you and your own people didn't budget the wall, but once you lost power, suddenly it's an emergency (that somehow was ignored for 2 years by you) that isn't your fault?????
What about gun violence.  Ohhhh right mass shooters are usually white men so that's ok.

A teaching fb post “borrowed” from another:  One of my friends told me about a powerful lesson in her daughter's high school class this winter. They're learning about the Salem Witch Trials, and their teacher told them they were going to play a game.  "I'm going to come around and whisper to each of you whether you're a witch or a normal person. Your goal is to build the largest group possible that does NOT have a witch in it. At the end, any group found to include a witch gets a failing grade."  The teens dove into grilling each other. One fairly large group formed, but most of the students broke into small, exclusive groups, turning away anyone they thought gave off even a hint of guilt.  "Okay," the teacher said. "You've got your groups. Time to find out which ones fail. All witches, please raise your hands."  No one raised a hand.   The kids were confused and told him he'd messed up the game.   "Did I? Was anyone in Salem an actual witch? Or did everyone just believe what they'd been told?"  And that is how you teach kids how easy it is to divide a community.   Keep being welcoming, beautiful people. Shunning, scapegoating and dividing destroy far more than they protect. We're all in this together.
Let’s deport democrats
Dems=Israel and Russia first

Yes CNN ABC WAsh Post NY Times have polls of 788 people, 475 people, and other  silly polls...when there is 325 million that live in the USA. So Pelosi states "NO" prior to the speech. She and her group want the Gov't opened, then they will proceed to "talk". Let's see now: You loan me $500,000 now, and later we will "talk" & I will agree to sign the Contract, well maybe and maybe NOT. Hilarious ! Or is there a problem with what sits above the neck on the LEFT ? That is an assumption that others are as dumb as you are.

Real News: When #BigotPresident meets #MoronPresident: San Antonio does not have a border wall and is 157 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.  President Trump incorrectly claims San Antonio has a border wall  Speaking to reporters Saturday, the president cited San Antonio's nonexistent border wall as the source of improved security in the city. TEXAS Author: Kens5.com staff Published: 2:30 PM CST January 19, 2019 Updated: 2:48 PM CST January 19, 2019 WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — Ahead of his "special announcement" Saturday on the government shutdown and the border, President Trump told reporters that "walls work," citing San Antonio's security improvement since putting up a wall.  "You look at different places," Trump told members of the media, "they put up a wall, no problem. You look at San Antonio, you look at so many different places. They go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities immediately. Immediately. It works, we have to put them up, and we will put them up. We've got to."  San Antonio, however, does not have a border wall and is 157 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.  Trump visited the Rio Grande Valley along the edge of the U.S.-Mexico border last week. During his visit, the president took part in a roundtable discussion on border security and met with Border Patrol agents stationed along the border.  Throughout the government shutdown, which has lasted nearly a month, Trump has insisted that a crisis exists at the border which would be fixed by a border wall.  During the president's visit, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told him the state will build a wall along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border if the federal government pays Texas back.
Build that wall!
Thank you Pres. Trump!

That’s why you are President! Let no one and nothing stop you.

The left is just trying to make the President look bad. They have nothing to show what they have done for the American people. We need term limits for all of Congress.

narrator: the true devil at work doing what he done for 99.9.9.9 infinities ago never ends
"Trump has long defined himself as a counter-puncher: When he’s hit, he feels the need to respond in kind, out of a fear that failing to do so will be a sign of weakness. But in this case his return volley underscored his own impotence. Knowing exactly how to hit him where it hurts, Pelosi has threatened to deprive him of his biggest audience of the year if he persists with his shutdown; in terms of optics and political capital, canceling a Congressional delegation (referred to in official Washington as a CODEL) is small potatoes, and the fact that the legislators were going to see American troops in a war zone that he has not yet bestirred himself to visit only makes him look more petulant." https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-petty-shutdown-games-show-art-deal-author-has-ncna960276?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma

Clueless fool needs to find a way to resign.  But he can't plea-bargain until the charges against him are made public.  So he hangs around, watching Fox News and eating hamburgers, at the center of a closed government and a public that overwhelming disapproves of him and everything he stands for.
Amen  we are standing  with  you.

REAL FAKE NEWS RIGHT HERE!
Thank you Sir!
the horror stories of crimes by non-citizens are scary but the scariest of all is the monetary effect of driving down wages and driving up the cost of living.. Fact: even if your parents did not go to college and you did, you can NOT afford the same quality of life as your parents today.  THIS IS WHY
even if you have a masters degree and your parents had no degree, you can not afford the same quality of life as your parents (on average)-> this is the honest to god truth.
the law of supply and demand.  wages are a price.  scarcity of workers affects the demand (price) / (WAGE)!!!!  this hurts minorities the most.  a lot of people are aware of this.  not only that but every year public sector gives itself raises but private sector is held down by mass immigration.  This is a problem even for Democrats because ultimately, even if you tax the private sector 100% you will not be able to fund the public sector.  As it is, there is talk of removing private property and every other scheme we conquered at the dawn of America and the forces driving these motives are caused by mass migration which drives down wages via the LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND!!!!  we are screwed if we don't fix this and it really is national security.  MEANWHILE the people causing this are doing every thing they can to stop citizens from having children..
Now some people think "Robots" can replace workers.. and they might be right.. so they may think depopulation would be ok since robots can build the products.. PROBLEM: ROBOTS WONT BUY YOUR PRODUCTS!!!!  this is flat out destruction of civilization.
I have heard many Democrats say "Oh Trump is a billionaire Tycoon trying to use the government to get rich"--> Sorry but Trump is not the owner of a steel factory or oil company or drug company-- this is not how I understand Trump made his mark --> instead he made his mark in the toughest real estate market in the world: NY.  Now if you ask me, Trump is trying to help the economy FOR REAL because wealthy Americans PAY THEIR RENT ON TIME! this is a win-win.  This is super easy to see.. and by the way, IF YOU DONT LIKE LIVING THERE: MOVE!
MAGA!!!!!!
She don't care
There ahould not be one Angel family

Things has to be done decently and in order. This was tacky, careless, cold hearted and heartlessly. Starting with tearing families apart leaving kids to defend for themselves. Granted, things has to be done for the border. Y at the cost to get what u want thru negative reinforcement? Bulling. Negative behavior NVR draws a positive response. U know this Trump! U understand the power of words and for u to go against what u said is the most humiliating thing for u to do. Ppl are suffering Trump. Heck, u are suffering. Do u not have health issues? Throw in the white towel already...

Please leave this page and read Real News elsewhere about the #MoronPresident For Example: Trump Touts Border Wall In San Antonio, Which Has No Wall And Isn't On The Border  Mary Papenfuss HuffPostJanuary 19, 2019  President Donald Trump on Saturday boasted to reporters about how well San Antonio’s border wall  is working. But the Texas city is 150 miles from the Mexican border and has no wall.  “Everybody knows that walls work. You look at different places, they put up a wall, no problem,” Trump said outside the White House. “You look at San Antonio, you look at so many different places, they go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities, immediately, immediately.”  The president may have intended to refer to El Paso, a Texas border city he referenced last week in an almost identical anecdote ― though he is wrong that the wall there had any effect on its crime rate.  Trump discussed the nonexistent wall in San Antonio before he offered three years’ protection for the so-called Dreamers — immigrants who came to the U.S. as children — in exchange for Democratic support for $5.7 billion for his border wall. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) quickly ripped the deal as a “non-starter.”  Part of San Antonio is in the district represented by Texas GOP Rep. Will Hurd, who opposes Trump’s wall as expensive, ineffective and damaging to private property and the environment. His district includes 820 miles of the border. In an interview this week with Rolling Stone, he called Trump’s characterization of a “crisis” at the border a “myth.”  (You can read the rest at news.yahoo.com and read actual news anywhere but on this preposterous page, led by an accomplice in the tRump Crime Family.)
Thank you,Mr.President!

All this as a tribute to childish vanity, Junior Achievement leadership, and Russian strategy:  DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old. Here are 30 ways Americans are feeling the pain:  1. 450,000 public workers are being made to work without pay, including members of the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, Border Patrol, FBI, and Secret Service. 2. 350,000 public workers have been temporarily laid off. 3.

Thank you President Trump for keeping your promises to the American people.  Just imagine what could be accomplished if DemocRATs and MSM (but I repeat myself) have you one half the cooperation they gave O’Blahblah.  I remember that despicable display at the last SOTU when they refused to stand and clap for the flag, USA, legal immigrants OR honor Angel parents.  Why do DemocRATs support every country but Americans and USA?
Stand your ground. Stand our ground.

What about gun control?
Pretty sure Obama fixed that during his 2 terms, oh wait ?🤓😂
100 Million people died under communist dictatorships. The first thing the commies did was get people to give up their guns. Not going to happen in the USA with so many commies running in government. Media will not report it. Trump is right about the media same agenda in Canada.

The liberals should be warned that if they keep poking the tiger, they're going to get bit.
(Exodus 20:12). Leviticus 20:10 prescribes capital punishment for adultery between a man and married woman: And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
Smells like taco meat
Democrats don't give a damn about angel families. Only their potential  illegal immigrant voting base.

President Trump, please stand firm on your efforts to protect America's borders and keeping us safe. The democrats are wrong in not negotiating with you and they don't really care about the government workers not being paid or they would. It is so very wrong how the left-wing media treat you, so disrespectful to you and the office of the presidency! Praying for you!
How much longer are we going to play this game ?  You can end the shutdown and have a wall with a stroke of a pen... What are you waiting for ?
more leap glans on Lara
We are all grateful for President Trump’s efforts and commitment to securing our borders....... just think of the positive effect this will have on reducing drug availability throughout the United States. We can’t surrender in the war on drugs.

This is a great message bc President Trump comes across to me, as caring, he’s polite and personable. This Angel Mom confirmed what I see. If I was in Pelosi chair, I’d set those ppl right in a hurry. She’s laying low, as they say. If this was Healthcare I’d be on the other side. js... I think we have to look 👀 at this with fresh eyes 👀, open heart’s and mind’s. You have to do a deal, pass legislation, be present. You can’t deny a meeting when it’s your job. A woman who knows her power and uses it in the best interest of the situation, that’s a powerful woman who cannot be bought. Who is Nancy Pelosi ? As a person, I do not know??? She’s hiding.
Laurence Hyatt Thank you 😊 very much!
more leap glans on Lara
Yes and we are with you
I dont want the wall.  I want a President worthy of respect.
Democrats turned the values against the USA.  The drank Obama’s Kool side and they are fundamentally trying to change it to an open border socialist state.  One World Government so who cares where people move.
In case the real donald j trump forgot....  https://www.facebook.com/1087167058116488/posts/1188671814632678/
President Donald Trump is trapped. He shut the government to impose his will on the incoming Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. That plan has miserably failed. Instead, Trump has found himself caught in the trap he supposed he had set for his opponents.  Now he is desperately seeking an exit.
Laurence Hyatt Thank you 😊 very much!
KEEP FIGHTING MR. PRESIDENT! WE SUPPORT YOU! YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR THE DEMANDS AND WISHES OF YOUR PEOPLE! THANK YOU FOR NOT PLAYING THE POLITICS GAME! #MAGA 🇺🇸

A private U.S. nuclear energy company could begin helping Ukraine in the production of enriched uranium, the fuel in nuclear power plants, according to a statement on Thursday (July 2) from Kiev's nuclear authority, Yadernoye Toplivo
Unbelievable, what’s going on with the DIMMS and RINOS preventing the sovereignty of our nation because of their allegiances to the globalist billionaires and Corporations!  We as a nation are under attack by nefarious forces from the criminal empires to foreign governments.  So, what does this call for in full force is for President Trump to even further his resolve by acting without hesitation in using the Executive Branch to secure our borders, and charge those involved in sedition and treason!
Thank you Mr President
If his pledge to them is anything like the pledge to the kids in Parkland they shouldn't get their hopes up.
Please #pray for President Trump. He is under severe attack from our enemies at home and abroad.                                                     Ephesians 6:11-12, 18  (King James)   Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
MR. PRESIDENT TWO PEOPLE KILLED IN MY DOUGLAS COUNTY , NV AND TWO IN RENO ,NV.  By ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT !!! YOU NEED TO KNOW !! THEY GOT HIM OVER THE  WEEKEND!!  PLEASE KEEP UP THE BUILD THE WALL/ BORDER SECURITY!!! THANK YOU !!

GOD BLESS THE ANGEL FAMILIES SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS  I BACK U ALL AND MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS R WITH U ALL ..THANKS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND GOD BLESS U ALSO ..
Pelosi is the sorriest excuse for a human being ever to walk this earth.
..and while tyrants like Pelosi are trying to steal our gun rights by saying if we give you a wall, there will not be a need for guns, just remember the 2nd amendment wasn't intended for defending yourself from others, but for defending yourself from a tyrannical government!!!!!
... and we the people, never stop fighting for you. Trump 2020 ❤️

2 Chronicles 20:20 New International Version (NIV)  20 Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the Lord your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful.”    Praise God. Amen Amen. https://www.missiondelcaribe.org/listing/ghfn/
How many times did he say, “MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL.”  He said it in every speech. And when anyone asked him HOW that was going to happen he (not surprisingly) didn’t have an answer.   Not only is he a liar but he is an in your face liar bcz he knows he will get away with it. He will tell you anything and you will believe it.  Now thousands of Americans aren’t getting paid, our country is in shambles, and MEXICO is never going to pay for that wall.  Pathetic.

The democrats Remember that the doctrine of a party is essential to reach the ectica, it is the opening of divine providence to where great men come, among them Donald Trump, an economist converted in the justice of human rights, is the heart that flows . the movement. It is not a theater but a spontaneity where wisdom flows. it is necessary to support our President, where logic is the evidence of the old problem of immigrants who have not found a solution today, I invite you to join the President to help our workers and increase their talent, if they are among them, young Dreamers their gift of being American citizenship.

Nancy is a twit. It's a shame she hates legal Americans whose taxes pay her overinflated salary. If she really feels barriers don't protect people, she should take down the fence at her house and forgo secret service detail. She's a joke!

You made a pledge to the American people to protact and serve , not just Angel families.. this shutdown violates that pledge... workers are going without pay because of your lies about the dam wall... are their livelihoods being destroyed really worth a wall... I think not...
Go clean up Mexico so these people can go home. Declare a state of emergency and quit dangling Americans as pons.
Aloha President, we have found the Simple Solution to the Healthcare Crisis called: Lifestyle Insurance. It’s everything that you have been looking for that conservatives will love – privatizing $5 to $10 trillion worth of lifestyle healthcare now being covered by gov’t programs. Even Democrats will like. I know, I took it DC.  It’s best if offered as a 3 to 5-minute presentation in person (via phone) or u can peruse here on Facebook. Link to the 1 page of the 2 page brochure below.   https://www.facebook.com/LifestyleInsuranceSolution/photos/p.996411033845340/996411033845340/?type=1&theater
Anyone out there can help us please and thank you. https://www.gofundme.com/6qhodig

Here's What The Data Tells Us By Sean McMinn & Renee Klahr�January 10, 20194:58 PM ET  When it comes to people in the country without proper documentation, the majority of them didn't cross the Mexican border at all. Most of them came to the United States legally — but then don't leave. About 700,000 travelers to the United States overstayed their visas in fiscal 2017, the most recent year for which the Department of Homeland Security has published figures. DHS estimated that, as of Sept. 30, 2017, the end of that fiscal year, more than 600,000 of those travelers were still in the U.S.

Ukraine mulls cooperation with ConverDyn for construction of conversion plant project A private U.S. nuclear energy company could begin helping Ukraine in the production of enriched uranium, the fuel in nuclear power plants, according to a statement on Thursday (July 2) from Kiev's nuclear authority, Yadernoye Toplivo. The meeting, which took place on June 23 in Kiev between ConverDyn external link and Ukrainian officials, is another indication of Kiev's attempts to diversify its future energy needs and distance itself from Russian-produced energy, reports pro-Ukrainian news website UNIAN. "At present, ConverDyn is interested in cooperation with Ukrainian companies in the field of uranium conversion services for Ukraine’s nuclear energy industry," the official statement reads. "During the meeting, the parties discussed the potential possibility of jointly building the uranium hexafluoride production facilities in Ukraine." (International Business Times July 3, 2015)

No pay no wall
Trump, I'm telling you I want the government reopened first... Do your freaking job and keep the government open...
THEN STOP ALLOWING DEMOCRATS TO DELAY THE WALL BEING BUILT... BUILD THE WALL NOW
No more negotiating with these people. Shut the border down completely and we'll see how fast they want to come to the table.
Trump said he made a pledge to Angles Families. Was that pledge anything like what he said about the Gold Star Family Khan or the Gold Star Family that Trump said " he knew what he was getting into, when he signed up ".
I live in Texas, I challenge every member of Congress who has voted against the wall to camp on the border (El Paso or Laredo, their choice) with zero security for a couple of nights...bet that wall will get funded! ❤️🇺🇸❤️
Hmm... there are so many MORE Angel Families whose loved ones have been murdered by citizens ... but I guess they do not count, because they are not part of YOUR agenda. Sickening. :(

Why woud they even want to meet with Pelosi?  It's obvious that she and the rest of the liberals don't give a crap about them or their dead kids.  They simply don't want Trump to get any credit for cleaning up this nation, no matter who it hurts.
GO TRUMP, MAGA, SAME AGAIN IN 2020.
They won’t give the democrat mobs!! This will be Trumps trademark the wall and it should be done ✅ promise kept Thank you our President Trump🙏❤️🇺🇸💪
Lara TRUMP with the BOTOX lips, I bet she can't whistle!
Mr. President, this phony Mueller investigation is unlawful. Big Tech censoring conservative voices is unlawful.   We see thousands of conservatives taken off various platforms for "hate speech", the nature and definition of which is continually fluid and indefinable.   I don't understand why you allow all of this unlawful behavior from people who are clearly in the wrong.

Let's not forget our broken judicial system, criminals are getting away with murder and with a team of klepto serial killers. Can you believe some criminals go to jail for other criminals crimes and get released years later as planned.
This is a example why the democrats actions are reckless to this country especially California
You and McConnell won’t allow a vote to help Americans but you will allow a vote to help Russia by lifting sanctions!!!! Time to impeach, these two need to go. Weakest 2 people in congress.

One day the American people will realise that the democrats hate them.
Great post from Christina Henderson, the colleague of a friend who works in Congress:  A year ago, Trump was offered by Dems $25 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA TWICE! Let me repeat this part — $25 billion for the wall today, in exchange for a 10- to 14-year path to citizenship for 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were young. And twice Trump agreed to it before turning it down 24 hours later (thanks Stephen Miller and John Kelly).  The THIRD time he could’ve had a deal, a group of bipartisan Senators came up with another offer which could win the support of 60 Senators. A path to citizenship for DACA recipients, $25 billion for border security, and it prevented DACA recipients from sponsoring their parents for legal status. Trump was on board in theory to let the “King of the Hill” plan play out (4 immigration bills on the floor and let the best man win), but the morning before the vote, Trump threatened to veto this bipartisan bill. As a result, it failed 54-45. The night before, there were 60. The Trump favored bill, which gutted legal immigration to the US and provided $25 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA, only got 39 votes that same day, to be clear. The lowest number of votes of the 4 immigration bills voted on that day.  Months ago the Senate approps Committee passed a bipartisan $1.6 billion for border security—no new barriers could be constructed. That’s what DHS asked for in the appropriations process. And in the 11th hour, Trump said that wasn’t good enough.  Sooooo this idea that some how Democrats are being unreasonable here is laughable. Every time they think they have a deal he changes his mind on the terms. Staff meets but everyone knows no one but him at the WH is authorized to agree to anything. It is like negotiating with Jell-O. And he has already said he is not willing this time to trade for anything — DACA, TPS, etc. He wants $5 billion, no strings attached. And when your friends ask, why Democrats won’t agree to that after being willing to give him $25 billion a year ago — say these three words: elections have consequences. The makeup of the House and Senate has shifted and so have the votes.  Trump could’ve had his wall, but he’s not a good negotiator—he walked away from the best deal he could’ve had a year ago. Who knows what he’ll say at 3pm today, but at this point it looks like the national emergency is the only way he can save face. Because when he says I’m waiting on Nancy to call me to make a deal, what he really means is I’m waiting on Nancy to come and give me exactly what I want. That may have happened with Paul Ryan, but it’s a new day. And let’s be real, there aren’t even enough moderate, red state Senate Dems left to reach 60 while a third of the caucus seems to be flirting with a run for President.  {fin. leaves soapbox.}”- Christina Henderson
USA Tax payers have been financing their very own demise. STOP doing that. Start by confiscating George Soros asset and his dark money and deport him, his family, his supporters and beneficiaries if you wish to keep your country.
trump made the system worse - he unilaterally ended DACA & the TPS system.

Stop the salaries of the Congress, Senate-declare a national emergency.
Democrats have rejected a perfectly reasonable offer by Trump -DACA and TPS protection for 3 years in exchange for a steel barrier slat-fence (wall, whatever). Furthermore, not one damn Democrat politician gives two greasy craps that essential employees (ones made to work throughout the shutdown) are not being paid. We were supposed to validate our time this past Friday. Now, it’s two pay checks  that we will have missed. Retroactive pay is BS; We have bills NOW!    Do me (and other essential employees) a favor and call your Congressional representatives now!  The following bills get us paid now, but are languishing in Appropriations Committees. Refer to the bills below:  Senate Bill 111 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/111?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S+111%22%5D%7D&s=1&r=1  House Bill 371 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/371/text  House Bill 301 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/301?s=1&r=55

This is all about Nancy pelosi and Chuck Schumer he could care less about the American people and the thousands that are out of work because of the shutdown this is a political pawn to them and the longer it goes on her no more likely I am getting reelected is 0
He's tweeting the 11 million number from 20 years ago this morning. Ann Coulter is right.

No wall ever
Biggest group of illegals are Canadians overstaying their visa. You're not even barking up the right tree
It’s not a crisis.  President Reagan implored Gorbachev to “ tear down this wall.”   No to building communist walls.
Why are we letting Pelosi rule this country? She is not President and yet she is saying no to things the Democrats would like to compromise on and get this country moving again. She needs to resign due to selfish, over bearing, mental problems that we can all see in her. She is overstaying her mental ability to be worth a nickel. I am ashamed of her and I am not a Democrat.

https://canadafreepress.com/article/itin-the-massive-tax-loophole-allowing-illegal-aliens-to-defraud-american-c  Please fix this mess! 4.2 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. As an American we do not get to claim 20 children not living in our home. We as Americans must show proof if we make a mistake we are fined and penalized. This is not fair close the loophole.
Don't back down from these fake leaders who are only concerned with their wants and not the people. But please, do not punish our government workers who deserve to be paid. We need another way to get this accomplished. What are we saying to the people who work hard every day? That a wall is more important than they are? I want the wall. I will even vote for all Americans to pay a special tax to fund it. But Pelosi could care less about our people--her unwillingness to talk and negotiate proves this. Lock all of the Dems and Reps into a room and no one comes out until a decision is reached. No baths, no sleep, just negotiate. This is a national emergency--and it needs to be handled as such.
Mr. President.  Declare the state of emergency!  Then, have the State of the Union address on schedule. Nancy needs a comedown!

Thank you President Trump !!  We need the Wall.  WALL is CHEAPER !  The additions and upgrades proposed by the Democrats will incur Information Technology infrastructure costs that will eventually exceed the cost of the wall. New digital sensors, cameras, outdoor wireless repeaters, expensive servers to monitor the new equipment, expensive switches to carry the network load. Remote hardware stations needed to allow access to sensors in remote areas.  Digging to extend hard wire networks.  Server updates, sensor and camera firmware updates, switch firmware updates.  The IT costs alone are mind boggling.  THE WALL IS CHEAPER !!!!
A ladder is even cheaper.
Thank you Mr. President.   Pelosi's home district in San Francisco is in disorder.  Homeless people sleep in the street and use it for a toilet.  Men walk around nude trying to attract other men.  Now she is trying to turn the whole country into a wasteland.  We all must let her know that we want a Wall on the border.  Go to her website and get her addresses for her offices and send a letter there so she receives a huge volume of mail to let her know we don't want to be like San Francisco.
Donald J. Trump‏Verified account @realDonaldTrump   Don’t forget, we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly, and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building, after all, is what I do best, even when money is not readily available!........Of course it would cost less if you're not building a concrete wall from sea to sea....DUH.   Also, Contractors have replaced miles of dilapidated fencing with more modern alternatives, but they haven't built barriers anywhere they didn't exist already. When money isn't available you just don't pay the contractor, like you have done previously in your life.
If Mexico don't stop the Caravans,  Shut the Border down of all vehicle crossing at the ports of entry.  They will change their tune in a hurry.

The Democrats like I said will not agree to anything unless it benefits them. We need more border security and some type of wall. We can't even take care of our own people (elderly, disabled, poor). Yet we're suppose to let all these people in our country and give them everything. No, something has to be done.

I don't think he thought about the fall out that his shutdown would cause. It's not just 800,000 Federal Workers, but it extends to those that these workers owe money to. Local businesses are losing money because residents are not spending. This is very far reaching and is affecting millions. And then there are people who are rationing their medications because they can't afford to get more while they're not getting a pay check. And I would imagine that once the government does open it's going to take a bit of time to start to generate that load of paychecks for distribution.  trump creates messes and then offers to fix them. And his base can not see the obvious!
100% 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥The socialists want open boarders, crime,drugs and human trafficking on top of stealing 50billion dollars of the Secure Finance Act that was to construct a wall, A heist orchestrated by Hussein Obama administration which they must account for.👌

Trump and Republicans had $25 Billion for their wall last time but it wasn't good enough! Trump wanted Stephen Miller's (Fantasy) 4 point immigration plan that even most Republicans said was too extremist. Trump got himself into this mess by owning it and we aint saving him! Republicans in the Senate will have to fall on their swords to open the government by bucking Trump. Otherwise they can rot in hell till the next election.
I’m grateful the our President is standing our ground!  Our Country is more important.. Patriots know the paychecks are being held up by Dems just to spite our President and keep him from keeping his promise to us!   Pelosi was just getting ready to leave the Country for a family vacation on your dime!  All the while people aren’t getting paid!   Build the Wall Now!
Donald Trump is the man at the Top https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1880659858632162/
Mr president even though I’m an immigrant myself ( a legal immigrant) but I totally agreed with you 100% on everything that you are doing right now for all us citizens here in the United States.  Please make America Great Again Mr. president Donald Trump!  Please keep up with your good works and screw all of the leftists and socialists!
Put Will Hurd from Texas in charge of the southern border. YOU protect us by eradicating ISIS.  After all, didn't you say you know more than the generals?
Does the art of the deal include letting a senile old woman out deal you...
I don't think he thought about the fall out that his shutdown would cause. It's not just 800,000 Federal Workers, but it extends to those that these workers owe money to. Local businesses are losing money because residents are not spending. This is very far reaching and is affecting millions. And then there are people who are rationing their medications because they can't afford to get more while they're not getting a pay check. And I would imagine that once the government does open it's going to take a bit of time to start to generate that load of paychecks for distribution.  trump creates messes and then offers to fix them. And his base can not see the obvious!
Does the art of the deal include letting a senile old woman out deal you...
the only broken record here is you mr Trump...go back to your reality tv show - let someone who can read lead this nation....lol

when are you going to start the FIXING? You had TWO YEARS
Wow leave the borders open import some Muslims and just like that we get socialists in office ... plenty other countries to go to if you prefer socialism ....have a safe trip
The only pledge he made is to some big corporation that they can build the wall
Build a dome. Only way to keep America safe, and military patrolling g the streets like in Israel.
Oh so much bullshit. All security agencies are working without pay to protect Americans and Trump plays political games for a wall that Mexico was promised to pay for. How many lie can a Trump supporter support? Millions because they can't read about history.
What can we do to help "our" citizens who are without right now, because "our" government sure isn't gonna do anything... Inslaving people... People "protesting"/"begging" to work because we live in a system of "work" and "money". vs self reliance, know how and bartering... Please write... Do not let your voice go unheard!!! If we don't fight for us... No one will??? The time is now... I guess inslaving people, while watching them lose everything, go hungry and possibly die without medical for appropriate medical care... Is how "he" was going to make America great again. Is it not enough that our school system suffer and we are one of the most illiterate countries on the planet, but now you want to cut funding. The rich will remain rich and poor will remain poor, no matter how great your credit is the 1% is running it's own people (per usual) into the ground.... Literally!!! #Speak #Amendments #OneLove #Freedom #SilenceKills #OneForAll
The bill that would have kept the government open was voted on and passed by the Senate on December 19, 2018. It was sent to the House. The House added $5.7 billion to it for the boarder wall, voted on it, passed it, sent it back to the Senate. It has sat there on Mitch McConnell’s desk where it was last considered on January 2, 2019 with McConnell refusing to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote. This shutdown is squarely on the shoulders of Mitch McConnell.  , wtf
the only broken record here is you mr Trump...go back to your reality tv show - let someone who can read lead this nation....lol

Like always Don the Con hasnt fullu thought this through, if the borders are closed how is he and his businesses going to hire the illegals they depend on?
Pelosi is not the President stopping treating her like one.  The people elected President Trump.  Build the WALL.
No body invite them come USA that why they alive or they die is not concern America . Why they don’t come or stay mecxico because they want welfare medical do you pay tax for them

The December 2017 draft memo—which Merkley shared with NBC News after receiving it from a government whistleblower—shows that Trump administration officials wanted to deport children more quickly by denying them asylum hearings after taking them away from their parents.  "It appears that they wanted to have it both ways—to separate children from their parents but deny them the full protections generally awarded to unaccompanied children," concluded ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, who led a class-action lawsuit on behalf of migrant parents.  President Donald Trump's "child immigration strategy is immoral and comes from a dark place in the heart of this administration," Merkley declared, responding to the revelations on Twitter. "Children are NOT expendable commodities in political battles."
The socialists want the votes of illegals. That's the basis of the problem. Until we repair the voting laws in this country that problem will remain the same. Let's demand proof of US citizenship before anyone can vote. That proof cannot be anything from the DMV.
Hang in there Mr. President. We're with you. At some point you might tell the people who aren't getting paid that it may be in their best interests to take advantage of our awesome economy to find a job in the private sector. Keep the gov't shut down, privatize those agencies that are necessary and let the departments and agencies that are proving to not be essential go away.
Build the damn wall !  Use crisis or military to build, or at least have large numbers of military patrol open areas.
Build the wall. Protect the world from Americans
All bets off Trump. They do not negotiate...the rules have been made...negotiating is off the table now..they made that decision. This is National Security at issue. Envoke your power...they are clearly representatives of foreigner immigrants and elite foreign donors, but not US Citizens.
Nancy pelosi is a republican too btw so please stop calling her a democrat...... this wall showdown is just for show because it’s the only issue her and trump differ on so they’re playing it up to the max
It’s there jobs and the RNC to start making that known to the American public. This is the type of thing that Sarah Sanders should highlight during WH Briefings.
At the expensive of the American people. 🙄
What did you pledge to Putin? Where are the translator's notes?

I hope and pray that you’re hands are tied over this. We are all ready to blow a f- ing cork. We have also reached our limit on this border crisis. Shut it the f-!! Down until further notice!!
Prey. TRump - I hope all republicans will let people know - especially those people who elected a Democrat in the house - that They elected a phony for Border Security person / they are Open Borders at heart - Like Nancy Pelosi Border Security is just lip service to them the Dems. This is what is on display right now. They fool them that they are not like Nancy Pelosi - now these people are being fooled and being lied to
I have the opportunity to share with you the wise advice=if you want me to.My heart aches for the safety of world civilization=but I am very poor financially.You might want to give me some personal help =as a charity for the orphans I'm raising.Write to me, do you have the desire to provide me with financial assistance?
You offered nothing new, you simply suggested what you have suggested before, and that keeping Dreamers here for 3 year extension would give them time.  These are people who have jobs, education and lives to live, how does this help them plan for a future.  Angel Families... give me a break. You are a horrible negotiator, and your wall has only 29% approval by the American people. Trump Tower has its own news studio, now that is just wrong, news like that is dictator news. Spin it Trump, but the facts are still the facts.
God be with you . Its for damn sure, the Democrats dont care for you or this country and its citizens.
Under the new dems/socialism, Americans no longer need passports, IDs of any kind since they care only for illegals who have none of those.  If the world's masses can walk across our borders without documentation, than we too shouldn't carry IDs for travel, benefits, etc. or is this luxury just for everyone except taxpayers?
G Tate Williamson it wont work just need a executive order.
Trump, why did you confiscate the translators notes?  Did you destroy them?  Why did you order the translator not to speak with anyone from your staff?  Why did you not have any members of your staff or other American officials present during your meeting with Putin in Helsinki?  Are you in debt to or being manipulated by the Russians?  Did you direct Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump tower?  Why are you attempting to ease sanctions on Russian Oligarchs? Stopped by bi-partisan Congressional efforts.  Why do you continue to act like an asset of Russia?
The meeting, which took place on June 23 in Kiev between ConverDyn external link and Ukrainian officials, is another indication of Kiev's attempts to diversify its future energy needs and distance itself from Russian-produced energy, reports pro-Ukrainian news website UNIAN.

Question: Which Party Platform is egotistical and which is Altruistic in nature? Politics are very simple to understand. There is a balance in between "The needs of the many out-way the needs of a few" AND "A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link" If we find the sweet spot in those two things we will live in heaven on earth. President Trump is thee closest we have come to this line of thinking in our history as a country.

President Trump, don’t surrender the United States Capitol to Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer go there speak to the American people. We don’t care if no one shows up as long as you do don’t let them do this to you this is why we elected you because of the kind of man you are and because of the kind of strength you have! Do your speech to the nation from the US capital! Maybe the supreme court the Republicans and others will still come but even if they don’t it would be a great and awesome thing for youTo do this and we will have great respect for you as we do right now! Don’t surrender the US Capitol building that belongs to the people not Nancy or chalk! We’re praying for you!
NO Politician should be Allowed to Leave, Be PAID, Until a Resolution is Made in the Anti-American democRATic Shutdown. Pres. Trump Should have Cancelled Pelosi's Military Return Flight. BUILD the WALL, PROTECT America/AMERICANs..
If you cave and give amnesty you will lose my vote along with a majority of your voters. Stay the course Mr. President.
Four more Angel Families———20 year old ILLEGAL ALIEN , Martinez Guzman, was just arrested in Carson City for the murder of 4 elderly Reno and Gardernerville Nevada residents last week. This POS is suspected of murdering a beloved 80 year old couple who were prominent members of our community. He also murdered two single elderly women.......each living alone. What kind of monster preys on the most vulnerable in our society? ANSWER: AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ONE. These murders are further proof that there is a real danger having unvetted illegals in our communities. Those who insist upon open orders and sanctuary cities ....appear to have more blood on their hands this week.    BUILD THE WALL NOW.....Before any more innocent lives are taken.
There are more crimes committed by citizens than immigrants. Do you ever get your facts right?
All Americans must be reminded it was the Democrats who would not talk to the Angel families and until November 2020 we can't let them forget it.

There are already extensive fences and barriers along the border. A new ‘wall’ (that can be tunneled under, climbed over, and sawed through) will not stop illegal immigration. Most people who don’t have legal resident status work hard and pay taxes through their paychecks and on the products they buy, yet get no medicare or social security in return. Stop the fear-mongering and posturing. Cut the crap, forget about the pointless wall, and pass a budget that rebuilds US infrastructure and improves education.
When something so rudimentary seemingly can’t be fixed we must acknowledge that it is no longer about the survival of a constitutional America, but the survival of the swamp dwellers and the club they have in Washington. #buildthewall

The crisis is within our borders, and although there may be a crisi at the southern border, children, AMERICAN children are being murdered inside their classrooms!!
You also made a pledge to all Americans that their #2A rights were safe.
I am from Australia and have watched some of the cnn news reports and numerous other news. Wow! There are clear and present agendas with reporters. Many are not reporting the news in an unbiased way. The way they accuse the President of so many things is appalling. I believe if people over there are accusing the leader of the country without evidence of what they are saying, should be charged with slander. It seems they are accusing with only opinions..theirs!  Wow...show some respect people.
Propaganda for the trump regime. Regimes only exist in dictatorships. You have no idea how to govern a nation. You only know how to RIP off customers, workers, and how to sell snake oil to your cult45.  Resign and make America great again and again and again (ad infinitum).

Fred Leenhouts democrats only condone violence they themselves create to incite panic so they can continue to take away privileges that was never supposed to be able to be amended. I am of course referring to our Bill of rights that they have in fact effectively changed to a bill of privileges that they can take away at anytime without notice, cause, or due process of any kind.

Since Israel built their wall, terrorism in the Jewish state has decreased by 99% which proves that walls work, even the least intelligent among us understand that.
Stay the course Mr. President.  The Democrats are playing partisan politics.  They will put our country’s security and sovereignty at risk to serve their political agenda.
TRUMP needs to pull the obama...at 1 minute past midnight on Friday Executive Order the funds to build border wall & massive security updates...as it will turn into human crisis once the liberals instigated caravan reaches US BORDER TOWNS!

“Trump suckered the Democrats into a battle royale over the southern border wall Trump has proposed.  By refraining from declaring a national emergency and then building the wall (with Department of Defense funds saved from the withdrawal from Syria), Trump can simply bypass Congress.  He can order the Army Corps of Engineers to build it.”
We’re just at the 30 Day mark of the government shutdown. Once that happens, President Trump can get rid of or downsize departments & programs that waste our money and resources through Fraud and Abuse:  Government investigators and private watchdog groups uncover fraud and abuse in the federal budget on a regular basis. There are three common problems: ineligible individuals and businesses receiving benefits, bureaucrats who abuse the public trust and members of Congress who abuse their privileges for private or political gain. In the first type of problem, fraud artists are attracted to the government because there are billions of dollars in contracts and grants to take advantage of. Here are some examples uncovered by the GAO and other investigators in recent years: ● Medicare. Erroneous and fraudulent payments to Medicare providers cost $20 billion annually. The program is vulnerable to an array of different scams such as inflated billings, claims for phantom patients and phantom procedures, and billings for services that are not supposed to be covered. The fraud goes on year after year and Medicare administrators are unwilling or unable to stop it. Experts are predicting that the huge new Medicare prescription drug plan will be particularly susceptible to fraud and abuse. ● Medicaid. As with Medicare, inflated billings and bogus claims under Medicaid, waste billions of dollars each year. The GAO found $1 billion of fraud in California’s portion of Medicaid alone. After a year-long investigation, the New York Times reported in 2005 that from 10 to 40 percent of the state’s annual Medicaid budget of $45 billion may be siphoned off in fraud and abuse. The paper found that outrageously bold rip-offs have proliferated due to the indifference of New York and federal policymakers. ●Medicaid-Nursing Home Benefits. These benefits are supposed to be for the poor, but financial consultants help higher-income seniors hide their assets in order to qualify. This scam imposes $10 billion in extra costs on taxpayers each year. ● Post-9/11 Grants #1 Much of an $8 billion federal program to help repair damaged New York offices near Ground Zero ended up going to build luxury condos and to projects outside Lower Manhattan. ● Post-9/11 Grants #2 A federal program to hand out free air conditioners to New Yorkers affected by the collapse of the World Trade Center ballooned in cost from $15 million to $100 million because of management failures and bogus claims. ● Housing Subsidies. Overpayments in federal rental housing subsidies cost $2 billion each year. ●HeadStart. This $7 billion program is rife with misuse of funds.  ● Social Security. Social Security pays out about $1 billion in fraudulent disability benefits each year. ● Farm Subsidies. The Department of Agriculture pays out millions of dollars—perhaps as much as half a billion dollars—of improper farm subsidies each year. ● Food Stamps. This program pays out about $1 billion annually in erroneous and fraudulent benefits, although problems have been reduced in recent years. ● Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA has a reputation for being sloppy with its disaster aid. It tends to hand out money indiscriminately after hurricanes and other disasters, and it loses millions of dollars to fraud because of its poor management. ● Earned Income Tax Credit. Almost one-third of EITC payments—about $9 billion annually—are erroneous or fraudulent.
DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old. Here are 30 ways Americans are feeling the pain:  1. 450,000 public workers are being made to work without pay, including members of the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, Border Patrol, FBI, and Secret Service. 2. 350,000 public workers have been temporarily laid off. 3. Tens of thousands of federal contractors have been laid off for a month, including janitors, security guards, and cafeteria workers. They are losing up to $200 million a day. It is unlikely that they will ever receive pay for the time they have missed. 4. Nearly 10,000 companies that do business with the U.S. government are losing money, according to the Washington Post. 5. Pop-up food banks have opened up to feed unpaid government workers. 6. The four week shutdown is costing the U.S. $200 million a day, or almost $6 billion so far according to analysis by The New York Times. 7. Unpaid TSA workers have been calling in 'sick' or quitting, leading to longer security lines and missed flights. Some airports have begun closing terminals. 8. The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9. Air Traffic Controllers, who were already suffering a 30-year staffing low, have been feeling the strain of going unpaid. Some have begun quitting. 10. With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21. The FTC's identity theft reporting system is shut down. 22. Student loans are being delayed as universities are unable to verify parents' income with the IRS 23. Small Business Administration loans have been delayed. 24. Domestic violence shelters that receive federal funds have been forced to cut services. 25. Highway and transit projects are being delayed or canceled. 26. Wildfire preparations in western states are delayed. 27. The National Hurricane Center's research has been delayed 28. The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo are closed. 29. Funding for Section 8 housing assistance has lapsed, placing low-income families at risk of eviction. 30. Civil cases in federal court have been delayed. Lawsuits against Donald Trump in federal court are on hold.
Enough with the propaganda. Stop holding almost ONE MILLION AMERICANS hostage! Reopen the Govt.
Your boss isn't happy with you.......Ann Coulter ‏ Verified account  @AnnCoulter  1h1 hour ago More Trump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb!
No to Illegal Aliens.  Yes, to the safety and security of each American Citizen and each Angel Family.  Build that WALL.
Thank you Lara Trump for sharing the real news....Mrs. MaryAnn Mandoza has to live with sorrow for the rest of her life.  She gave birth to a fine Son and grew him up on the right side of the law'; then lost him a day after he wished her a Happy Mother's Day.  Her Son Brandon "is" an Angel along with thousands of families who lost loved ones from illegal migrant crimes.  Nancy Pelosi, turns her face away. knowing we have a major problem.  She's very aware that the border wall is "must have"  She is hard-faced and cowardly ignores this group without empathy for their loss.  Just "one" life taken, should be more than reason enough to Build the Wall. President Trump is a Father, and a good one at that. We all know, he is totally against alcohol, drugs and crimes, respecting life itself.  He boldly and passionately took it upon himself to strive for a Great and Safe America and what a fantastic job he did in a short time. #walkaway and Reelect President Trump 2020 to finish what he started.
Stop the Shutdown come to the table with the American people AND THOSE 800,000 can get paid! Starting with an offer with a temporary plan for a permanent situation is NOT an opening or proposal it's BLACKMAIL! An offer to give something back YOU took away is NOT a PROPOSAL IT IS BLACKMAIL. USING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS BARGAINING CHIPS IS NOT A STRATEGY... IT IS EXTORTION!
# friends lived in California talked human trafficking, thefts, & smugglers a threat & w/- ¤ the wall!

Trump cares about a few specific dead people who support his talking points, but the vast majority don't interest him. Like the people killed by people who need mental health care, the people killed by guns, the people who die because they can't afford their medicine, and so on.
Trump cares for all Americans! He is trying to put America first!I can see how much he loves this country God bless America and President Trump!

Trump to Mexico: Climb my wall and you get to stay #AmnestyDon
Donald Trump declared today (Jan. 17) he was grounding Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s upcoming trip to visit troops in Afghanistan “in light of the 800,000 Great American workers not receiving pay,” alluding to the expense of flying military aircraft there.  Hours later, his wife Melania Trump was on board a US military plane to Palm Beach, Florida, where the couple have a private club, on a flight that Quartz calculates cost US taxpayers $35,000.
All's this for her son WHAT'S have to do with the immigration  isn't because someone cause a accident ,and because he was a police officer ,what about orther peoples dying everyday isn't because of the border ..,O.K. there some criminal ,but ain't everybody ,,,,just common sense  .WHAT'S happening to those dying  of shot gun in USA  . Why isn't always important the life of someone like a officer ,more then someone else
Newsflash. Illegal immigration can be solved without an expensive wall in which the money can be better used. Get tighter security, 24-hour surveillance, identify problems areas and times, and/or create a special task force designed just for that purpose. If that doesn’t work ask NASA since they figured how to fly to the moon surely this is an easy feat.  Take that money and cure cancer, improve public education, fund studies for mental health and substance abuse, or even fund St. Jude so they don’t have to beg strangers on tv.
The Democrats have a plan to fix the immigration problem, Trump just wants a wall
He knows what is coming, and has sounded his trumpet. Now, free-will and choice. That is the balance. God bless you, President Trump! <3 Amen

Michèle Biwer-Erpelding if you were an American we might care what you think.
Stephen Edwards and tell me exactly how Nancy and Chuck are being "mature" through all this.
What about a pledge to the 6 to 7 thousands workers killed on the job every year where you lifted Obama’s safety regulations to keep employees safe and hold corporations responsible?  What about a pledge to those killed by collapsing bridges because you don’t put money in infrastructure but massive life long tax breaks for you and your buddies?
Don't give in to them! Stand your ground President Trump!
Trump offers a deal on immigration and shutdown, and it hits a wall
Hold Your Ground, Mr President Donald J. Trump. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Republican Congress for 2 years, no wall money in expenditure bills, now a national emergency? Bullshit. Total wall cost $50-60 billion. National debt $23 trillion.  You do t h e math.
how about you pledge to protect AMERICAN CITIZENS FROM AMERICAN CITIZENS by creating a gun reform policy--
Michèle Biwer-Erpelding if you were an American we might care what you think.
Mr. Trump, stick to your guns. don't give an inch to these anti-American socialist dems......again i say, you give an inch, they will take a mile....remember Bush senior, "read my lips, no new taxes." how did that turn out? they will do the same to me and you.
I deeply respect you Mr. President and everything you’re doing to keep America safe and deal with the border crisis and thank you for everything you have done for us combat veterans.  I sincerely appreciate everything you’ve done I really do.    But please end the government shutdown there are people suffering because of it, there are government employees who have families who can’t even afford to buy groceries because of the government shutdown and all of the partisan bickering.  Not to mention the rest of the damage being done to the country because of this government shutdown.  Although since Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the Democrats refuse to compromise and deal with you they are just as responsible for this government shutdown now if not more responsible for the government shutdown because they will not compromise.    You have a lot of us who are behind you and support you including myself but please don’t let Nancy Pelosi and Schumer use this shutdown against you.  Please put an end to the government shutdown for the greater good of the country and maybe give the Democrats something they want most to get them to compromise on this and so you can get funding for the wall.  I don’t know I honestly don’t have all the answers and right now the government is in crisis it’s really a sever catch 22 right now.  All I can say for sure is that this government shutdown must end.    I’ve never seen America so divided before and it honestly makes me sad to see my country that I love so much so divided.  We need to unite America again somehow.    God bless you Mr. President we are behind you we support you but please find a way to reopen the government before further damage is done.  I wish you well and I wish your Presidency to be successful sir, God bless you and God bless America!
Additionally I have also sent a message to Nancy Pelosi telling her to put an end to this mess and compromise with you for the wall.  But then again no one is actually gonna listen on their end.  I don’t claim to know all the answers but I do know that we must end the government shutdown now and I know that the Democrats must compromise with you and make a deal.  Instead the Democrats are just dividing America further.

STAND YOUR GROUND MR.PRESIDENT!  KEEP THE SHUTDOWN! CALL FOR A CONVENTION OF STATES! KICK OUT THOSE WHO ARE BLATANTLY DISREGARDING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND DISRESPECTING THE PRESIDENT ! THEY ALL TOOK THE OATH TO PROTECT US AND THEY ARE NOT!
Since they didn't want to make a deal when the supreme court's end DACA start deporting them, to late for deals then.
Should go after crazy white guys, who are responsible for more violent crimes than any other group.
Just call a national emergency and end this shutdown
Open the government!  Trump shutdown needs to end.  Just a hoax
Then stop bowing to the Democrats and build the Wall, all this bullshit is making voters think the Democrats are starting to control President Trump to
The Liar in Chief preaching to the Sheeple!!!
Pres Trump has already worked a deal with the Trade Deal ie Mexico that will give USA 40 Billion per YEAR. Wake up.
Now he wants to negotiate if you would stop holding American people at hostage then maybe a lot will get done. I do admit that something has to be done with our Borders he has great ideas but he's going about it the wrong way stop holding American people hostage. In the shutdown.
Liar
You made a pledge Mexico will pay for the wall too!
Democrat want’s to be like communist that they care nothing but their on way. They are working only to cater illegal and big drug dealer. Those are the people are in their list. So the Democrat voters  they elected them Demorats congressman just to punch them and laugh at the voters. Unless they all cheat.
Democrats are trying to get people back to work and paid because their allegiance is to America. Republicans have showed they don't care about workers because their allegiance is to Donald Trump.
If you defund planned parenthood you could pay for the wall in 30 years without even changing the budget... just saying.
FAKE NEWS!!!!
"President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani argued Sunday he did not know for sure if Trump spoke with Michael Cohen about his congressional testimony, but that it would not have been significant if Trump did." What kind of double talk crap is that? This president and his administration is a dumpster fire.
The Liar in Chief preaching to the Sheeple!!!

Nearly 60,000 immigrants with arrest records -- including 10 accused of murder -- have been allowed to stay in the United States under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed Monday.  According to DHS, 59,786 DACA recipients have been arrested while in the U.S. -- approximately 7.8 percent of all who have been approved to remain in this country under the program since it was created in 2012. Of those, 53,792 were arrested before their most recent request for a so-called "grant of deferred action" was approved. Another 7,814 were arrested after their request was approved.

I get all my news from Kremlin State TV, Rump’s Real News, Alex Jones, Fox and Friends, and The National Enquirer. Good to know I'm well informed.  So I know that if you want to buy a box of cereal, you have to have a voter ID and that Donald gave our soldiers a 10% pay raise. Mexican drug smugglers throw sacks of drugs over the fence and our people get hit on the head with 60 pounds of stuff.  I know the deep state has access to weather weapons capable of not only creating tornadoes but also moving them around, on demand.  I know that the government is using chemicals in order to turn people gay, using a mysterious "gay bomb" devised by the Pentagon. I know that no one died at Sandy Hook Elementary School because the Uniform Crime Reports showed no murders in Newtown for 2012 and the “victims” were child actors.  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/alex-jones-5-most-disturbing-ridiculous-conspiracy-theories.htmlAlex Jones' 5 most disturbing and ridiculous conspiracy theoriescnbc.com

President Trump made a fair offer to secure wall funding but rather than submit a counter offer, Pelosi rejected it before EVEN hearing it. Democrats should be ashamed of their leadership.
Good
You have the high ground Mr. President. I'm with you Sir.
All Trump supporters should work for free during the shutdown, just like the 800k federal workers Trump didn’t mention. Put your money where your mouth is!
We are with you President Trump!
MAGA
Have ALL you whinging Remoaners read the Lisbon Treaty, if you haven’t, here’s a taster for you!  WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE LISBON TREATY, THE TREATY THAT COMES INTO FORCE 2020, ITS WORSE THAN THE SO CALLE DEAL, IF 99% OF THE BRITISH THINK THIS THE DEAL IS BAD JUST LOOK AT THE LISBON TREATY. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW, LEAVERS AND REMAIMERS..“What will actually happen if we stay in the EU” is a question no remainer will ever answer but here it is warts and all.  1: The UK along with all existing members of the EU lose their abstention veto in 2020 as laid down in the Lisbon Treaty when the system changes to that of majority acceptance with no abstentions or veto’s being allowed. 2: All member nations will become states of the new federal nation of the EU by 2022 as clearly laid out in the Lisbon treaty with no exceptions or veto’s. 3: All member states must adopt the Euro by 2022 and any new member state must do so within 2 years of joining the EU as laid down in the Lisbon treaty. 4: The London stock exchange will move to Frankfurt in 2020 and be integrated into the EU stock exchange resulting in a loss of 200,000 plus jobs in the UK because of the relocation. (This has already been pre-agreed and is only on a holding pattern due to the Brexit negotiations, which if Brexit does happen, the move is fully cancelled - but if not and the UK remains a member it’s full steam ahead for the move.) 5: The EU Parliament and ECJ become supreme over all legislative bodies of the UK. 6: The UK will adopt 100% of whatever the EU Parliament and ECJ lays down without any means of abstention or veto, negating the need for the UK to have the Lords or even the Commons as we know it today. 7: The UK will NOT be able to make its own trade deals. 8: The UK will NOT be able to set its own trade tariffs. 9 The UK will NOT be able to set its own trade quotas. 10: The UK loses control of its fishing rights 11: The UK loses control of its oil and gas rights 12: The UK loses control of its borders and enters the Schengen region by 2022 - as clearly laid down in the Lisbon treaty 13: The UK loses control of its planning legislation 14: The UK loses control of its armed forces including its nuclear deterrent 15: The UK loses full control of its taxation policy 16: The UK loses the ability to create its own laws and to implement them 17: The UK loses its standing in the Commonwealths 18: The UK loses control of any provinces or affiliated nations e.g.: Falklands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar etc 19: The UK loses control of its judicial system 20: The UK loses control of its international policy 21: The UK loses full control of its national policy 22: The UK loses its right to call itself a nation in its own right. 23: The UK loses control of its space exploration program 24: The UK loses control of its Aviation and Sea lane jurisdiction  25: The UK loses its rebate in 2020 as laid down in the Lisbon treaty 26: The UK’s contribution to the EU is set to increase by an average of 1.2bn pa and by 2.3bn pa by 2020 This is the future that the youths of today think we stole from them?  They should be on their knees thanking us for saving them from being turned into Orwellian automatons, if we escape from control of the EU.

Relax, the shutdown will be over in a few days.  Pres Trump needed a 30 day waiting period before he could fire all the useless employees and saboteurs in the bloated bureaucracy.

No Donald, this is a phony "crisis" you created and have continually lied about. Get Mexico to pay for your imbecilic wall like you said you would. You told the Democrats that you would proudly close the government and not blame them for it. What happened to both of those things? This is your mess. You are solely to blame.
What did TRUMP pay this stooge@
You do not Negotiate with a president when he has the country hostage!!
As Trump drags us into week 5 of the #TrumpShutdown, it's important to remember that he is holding 800,000 patriotic American workers hostage because he wants us to pay $5.7 billion dollars for a wall he promised repeatedly that Mexico would pay for!  Tell the Senate to pass the House spending bills and re-open the government here: http://bit.ly/2TtVTwr #NoWall

Carl Norman  Sad for you!
Never stop President Trump! You are doing an amazing job 🇺🇸
Trump`s so-called fighting has only created a major crisis at our southern border....Now he is trying to use "Angel Families" to correct the crisis HE created....It takes a special type of low-life like Trump to do something like that low...
Meanwhile, mainstream news outlets are not reporting that homelessness is “exploding” out on the west coast.  For instance, we are being told that there are “1000's of unauthorized tent camps” in the city of Seattle alone…  Housing prices are soaring here thanks to the tech industry, but the boom comes with a consequence: A surge in homelessness marked by 1000+ unauthorized tent camps in parks, under bridges, on freeway medians and along busy sidewalks. The liberal city is trying to figure out what to do.  But I thought that the Seattle economy was doing so well.  I guess not.  Down in San Diego, they are actually scrubbing the sidewalks with bleach because the growing homeless population is spreading hepatitis A everywhere…  San Diego now scrubs its sidewalks with bleach to counter a deadly hepatitis A outbreak. In Anaheim, 1000+ people sleep along a bike path in the shadow of Angel Stadium. Organizers in Portland lit incense at an outdoor food festival to cover up the stench of urine in a parking lot where vendors set up shop.  Over the past two years, “at least 10 cities or municipal regions in California, Oregon and Washington” have declared a state of emergency because homelessness has gotten so far out of control.  Nice Job Nancy?  Lori Williams posted 1/19/2019-  We have a huge homeless population here in the Antelope Valley, California's high desert. Every under/overpass, vacant field, and any place they can pitch a tent...not to mention store fronts. They're begging in parking lots, gas stations, medians, and even coming into the business where I work. Our homeless shelter closed for lack of funds, and I won't go out after dark anymore. If they do manage to move them, hazmat has to come and clean up after them. But hey, let's allow even more people in that we can't care for, sad.  -------------------- That is all.....
Don't give in Build the wall the CA Dems need to get there state in order before they talk about the way President Trump is doing.
Shannon M Kent was killed in Syria this week by the ISIS Trump claims is defeated. Two years of lies and one manufactured crisis after another .....as for agenda , still waiting for much better and much cheaper healthcare.
If he can't go down in History as the best President.  He would rather go down as the worst.  It's all about what HE can do. If you haven't figured that out, you are the problem.
The guy that ran a Campaign about AMERICA FIRST America First America First America First  Does away with 800k American JOBS that held key positions in our government that made us all a little safer. The Heartbeat of America.  Then realizing he had to have a few hundred thousand working. ORDERED them back to work with NO PAY. Like they are his subjects working under him in a MONARCHY. . America First for a promise to the people just does not jell with his actions.  I say, put them all back to work with back pay. Then when back to work, Talk about spending money on the MEXICANS.
FACT: A WALL IS NOT SECURE: 1. Despite a wall, on Monday last week, 376 Central American immigrants dug their way under the wall and illegally entered Arizona. 2. DHS testing on wall prototypes showed the steel slats can easily be cut with an ordinary household saw. IT IS NOT SECURE. It is only a campaign promise.
She don't care what you think. Get rid of her.

Robin Barnhill, I agree! Schumer is a liar and would never want to be accountable for his inaction and deceitfulness
Robin Barnhill, Democrats would screw up a wet dream if they understood what one was
Robin Barnhill, but since you say Trump can’t be trusted, then you accept you couldn’t trust him to reopen the government either? That means you also accept a very long government shutdown
Robin Barnhill, no matter what you say, even omitting such a comment doesn’t get the government reopened. Isn’t that what you are upset about?
Robin Barnhill, actually, I’m totally fine keeping the government shut down indefinitely
Dear President Donald Trump unlimited amounts of Thank you to you , love ❤️ you ! you are the only Billionaire President in the History of the USA who protect the safety security and interests of the citizens of the USA only! Absolutely no compromise on building of the southern borders wall! USA is unable even to take care of its very own citizens!
Com on com on
All Americans know that A wall alone is NOT Border Security!  How many AMERICANS can tRumP force to file bankruptcy (as he has done several times) by holding Americans Hostage- Seems he cares more about RUSSIANS then Americans by fulfilling Putin’s wishes & Dreams then he does the American people he is suppose to serve!!   NEGOTIATE the Dems want Immigration Reform & Security also!!!
Democrats as of this morning will not talk with any Angel families. Terrible, you don't have to be on either side to see that Democrats have there own agenda in getting power no matter what it takes. They're not America's friend, and if you stand for the Constitution of the United States their not your friend either. And I might add there not Christianity's friend either.  Reading and researching from the early years tells their true story about there agenda to change America.   The Christians will win this war in the end though when the ultimate Holy War breaks out in future time. God will always protect the United States Of America. O:) 🙏💒

Carol White but illegal immigration is how most of them make most of their money and acquire most of their support.
That's how Pelosi got some of her money from the land owners in California hiring the illegals for CHEAP labor working the fields.  And of course not just California.  The woman needs to go!  Judge Jeannne exposed her yesterday on her show. Did you know that Chuckie dirt face Schumer has been in congress for 38 years and nasty evil Pelosi for 32 years? When are we going to get 'TERM LIMITS' on the ballot in all of the states?  There has to be a way!

Why negotiate with this idiot? He changes what he wants daily!!! Who ever said he was a great deal maker? Oh yeah, he did. That has been proven false!!! Last year he could have gotten 25 billion for his wall. All he had to do was give in on DACA. Now he wants 5.8 billion in exchange for DACA. If he is on the other side of negotiations you have to be happy. You’ll be able to get anything from this BABY!!!

Go President Trump! Be strong and courageous for the Lord your God is with you!
She is a reptile.
At the cost of making the average American people suffer right, your wall is NOT more important than American lives. You're basically engaging in war with the middle and lower class and pray they bring it to your doorstep.. remember there's only a couple hundred of you but millions of us!!
you also said you would show your taxes.  Mexico would pay for the wall.  Not enough time to list all 7,538 lies.
Perhaps you should Rephrase that statement to say... " I will not stop till All American's are Safe and Secure." rather than just the Freakin Boarders Donald J. Trump
#TRE45ON!  You lack a fundamental understanding of America’s documented ideals.  That makes you dangerous.  And it means you have to go.  Impeachment, indictment, incarceration, and annulment loom larger than ever.  Soon...
Walls are for cowards to hide behind. What are you afraid of?
What a clown
But Trump do you realize how many families in America are going to be going hungry as long as you keep the government shut down? A lot of them DO have jobs but need food stamps too because they don’t make enough to pay their bills AND buy food! And what about the elderly and disabled who barely make enough on social security to pay their bills so they can’t afford to save money for food and other things?

I'm telling Nancy and Chuck to keep knocking your demented ideas out of the stadium. We all want border security that actually works. Walls didn't work during medieval times protecting castles and they don't work to this day. You can go over, under, around or through ANY wall. A wall still needs manpower and technology power to be secure. You're all a bunch of uninformed children of immigrants, EVERY ONE OF YOU!!!!
..and while tyrants like Pelosi are trying to steal our gun rights by saying if we give you a wall, there will not be a need for guns, just remember the 2nd amendment wasn't intended for defending yourself from others, but for defending yourself from a tyrannical government!!!!!
Where's the Mexican cash?  $0.02?  Where's the "greatest negotiator"?  We all know that hurting and holding millions of American's hostage is the strategy of a simple minded fake! Extorsionist! Humpty dumpty trumpty will fall 2019!

Tell Trump to resign someone make a pledge!
So do your JOB! Use your authority to send the military to secure the border and build the wall! The military just got a huge 745 Billion dollar budget! The non secure border presents the threat of terrorist crossings, and no telling how many already have, while we're being jerked around on the wall issue! This is a matter of National Security, and reclaiming our Sovereignty as a free and independent Constitutional Republic! You do not need congressional approval to secure the border! This is a matter of National Security and the safety of the American public! Stop jerking us around!
Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Mendoza was killed by a drunk driver as were 10,496 other people in America that year. Wouldn't banning alcohol be a better argument since in that same year only one person was killed by a drunk illegal immigrant.

Yes this is all about "Angel Families" first not government workers and that is across the board. Sometimes being an American takes sacrifice for what is right. The Angel families sacrificed first and will suffer for the rest of there lives not just a few weeks as their loved ones will never get a pay check because they are dead! The Angel Families will suffer directly due to our failed immigration policy for a lifetime, It's time to finish the wall.

I'm so sorry Mr. President but the "art of the deal" only works when you are working with sane people. The DNC is now a matter of the lunatics are running the asylum. We must not ever let these people win, ever. Where was the RNC during the mid terms, they did no get out the vote efforts, no voter registration, and did nothing to stop ballot harvesting in nursing homes, and did not challenge provisional ballots. The RNC fails us continually.

President Trump asked Pelosi if he stopped the shutdown today would she be willing to negotiate the wall in thirty days and she said no.
America is willing to come together and raise the money out of pocket if someone would get something legitimate started!
So Stumpy, if you want to secure the southern border with your folly of a big beautiful wall then explain how 367 refugees were able to tunnel under your magnificent all? And, not one word about the 1 million Federal employees and their families who have had to suffer because of your petty partisan politics. Yesterday afternoon you sounded desperate and you appeared to be weak. It's time for you to resign!
YOU ALSO PROMISED OR MADE A PLEDGE THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR THE DAMN WALL "NOT" THAT YOU WOULD HOLD 800,000 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES HOSTAGE IN ORDER TO GET YOUR DIAPERS CHANGED!
Please resign. You are neither fit, nor well. Children were kidnapped because of you. You will get what you deserve.

This is the Schummer Shakedown of the federal workers, and the Pelosi putdown of federal workers where she chooses illegals over their jobs.
What a joke of a president you shut down the government now people like myself can’t get paid what a clown 🤡
To be honesty and chaste (mean did not sexual inter course with anyone only with husband and wife) given to birth honest children are top religious, noble, honorable, high-level work.

WE NEED TO START THE TRUMP PARTY AS A PRIMARY NEW OPPOSITION PARTY AND LEAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THUS MAKING REPUBLICAN PARTY ITSELF THE THIRD PARTY. WE CAN USE THIS NEW OPPOSITION PARTY STRATEGICALLY TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS. IF TRUMP VOTERS WALK AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THERE IS NO REPUBLICAN PARTY. DISSATISFIED DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS VOTED WITH US FOR TRUMP. WE ARE MORE THAN YOU KNOW. GO MAGA GO TRUMP GO TEAM AMERICA

@realDonaldTrump To all of the great people who are working so hard for your Country and not getting paid I say, THANK YOU - YOU ARE GREAT PATRIOTS! We must now work together, after decades of abuse, to finally fix the Humanitarian, Criminal & Drug Crisis at our Border. WE WILL WIN BIG!
You cannot have border security without a strong physical barrier.  Do you remember 9/11?  We've gotten too complacent.  Do we need another terror attack to get you people to understand that?
Sir, that sounds comforting to American,s,dont mind enemies of progress,the democrats,americans are feeling the impact of your work ability.
NATIONAL EMERGENCY 🚨 NATIONAL EMERGENCY 🚨 NATIONAL EMERGENCY 🚨  Don’t let that traitor stop you from protecting America .   BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL !
Putin, Pence, McConnell, Deripaska and Trump walk into a bar. There is no punchline. Your conned trumpsters are the punchline. You were duped by a man with 5th grade vocabulary.
Obama has a Wall and much more than that around their house.  We the Tax Payers are paying for it. https://youtu.be/tT8sNIgF1oA
Did you make a pledge to parents of children slaughtered in schools by mass shooters?  Your priorities need to be realigned.
Donald J. Trump knows there is no reason to worry about running again or being president if he cant do what he promised. Unlike the entire rest of Washington Trump is free of political fear. He either does what he promised and gets this or he realizes there's no point to being there. He wont back down. Why would he? Its Chuck, Nancy and the rest of congress who hope to be there 20 more years.  Stay strong.  Economy is good people can get 2nd jobs in private sector.

Who are these angle families? Like you "have an angle to spread your partisan bullshit? The only angel family are those family's shattered by police violence. You don't care about actual issues though.  Just fabricating fear to spend your ignorance.
Angle families are victims of ILLEGAL immigrants
Did you make a pledge to parents of children slaughtered in schools by mass shooters?  Your priorities need to be realigned.
And most of America is with you.
When you salute an northern Korean general, bow to a Saudi Prince and don't not question a KGB president and does everything he tells you on a dime. You're not a Fkin American president.
Nancy is a Soros paid traitor...you will have to bypass her!
Actually, Trump is probably a BIGGER law breaker than ANY illegal.
U.S. citizens with guns kill more people, but all you’ve got for them is “thoughts and prayers”. Why aren’t the families of school shooting victims “Angel Families”? What about the families of all victims of all the shootings that occur every single day, regardless of the citizenship of whoever kills them?  Truth is, you have no more sympathy for these families than you do for anybody else. They are just pawns in your ongoing power play.
You only want a huge monument to your ego.  It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
Mother your children calling you long distance answer please mother we got discriminated again .please help them
Please list the laws that citizens can ignore and get a pass for breaking. I’ll wait. Hussein Obama’s dreamers are America’s nightmare. Deport them all.
No more negotiations with these people,,, use your presidential power and secure The boarder!!!!! Reopen the closed government shut down effective areas and get rid of pelosi and shummer!
Angle families are victims of ILLEGAL immigrants
Nancy knows we want the wall..is she in charge ? Is she in the White House? No ? Then what are we waiting for ? Stop prolonging this circus of the left.Prove to the country that she is irrelevant..
Be careful with how you treat People
America must have border security which a wall is a major part! We have seen lying politicians for years from both parties promise border security since Regan! We are sick of being lied to. We have your back, stand strong.
19th century symbol of hate: CONFEDERATE FLAG   20th century symbol of hate: NAZI FLAG  21st century symbol of hate: MAGA HATS
The establishment Republicans and Democrats are paid by globalist to stop the wall from being built.  No matter what you do or offer them, they are going to hate the President.  BUILD THE WALL because your refusal to build it will cause those that supported you to walk away from you.
I have the opportunity to share with you the wise advice=if you want me to.My heart aches for the safety of world civilization=but I am very poor financially.You might want to give me some personal help =as a charity for the orphans I'm raising.Write to me, do you have the desire to provide me with financial assistance?
Stay strong Mr. President. The majority of the American people are with you. TRUMP 2020.
Partisan people like myself can defend our party and our elected officials for their occasional missteps, but my conservative friends are finally starting to express disgust at their Republican Party and how it does not represent them or American values anymore with these scandals recently in the news:  1. The slow unfolding of the Robert Mueller investigation proving Russian assistance to the Trump campaign. 2. Maria Butina, a Russian spy who infiltrated the NRA to redirect a $30 million contribution from Russia to the Trump campaign.  3. Wisconsin and Michigan Republicans dismantling democracy as a lame-duck power because they lost an election.  4. Election fraud in North Carolina that totally eclipses anything any other group has ever done — to the point they realize they will have to repeat the election.  5. The local Tarrant County GOP attack against one of their own Republicans for being Muslim — totally anti-American and ignoring our Constitution.  6. The Texas GOP's attack on our LGBT citizens with ridiculous bathroom bills that are being resurrected for 2019.  To think that the biggest scandal of the Obama administration was the fake story he was born in Kenya.
No more negotiations with these people,,, use your presidential power and secure The boarder!!!!! Reopen the closed government shut down effective areas and get rid of pelosi and shummer!
Thank you for putting Americans before illegal aliens.
1/11/2019 Federal gov’t is encouraging child marriage Posted January 11, 2019	by Fraidy Reiss  Can you guess the minimum age for someone in the U.S. to petition for a foreign spouse or fiancé(e)? Or for someone to be brought to the U.S. on a spousal or fiancé(e) visa?  It’s zero. The federal government does not specify any minimum age for such petitions.  As a result, we at Unchained have seen girls under 18 forced to marry just so their overseas “husbands” can get U.S. visas. We also have seen girls brought to the U.S., legally, as child brides. Either way, the girls typically are raped and beaten within their “marriage” and not allowed to finish their education. All with the federal government’s approval.  Thanks to the AHA Foundation, which flagged this dangerous loophole and demanded data on the number of children impacted, we now know that between 2007 and 2017, more than 8,600 approved spousal/fiancé(e) visa petitions involved a child. In 95 percent of those cases, the child was a girl.  We at Unchained lead the growing national movement to end child marriage in the U.S. Along with the National Coalition to End Child Marriage that we co-convened with Equality Now, we will continue to push for a minimum marriage age of 18 in every U.S. state and at the federal level. Please continue to support us as we do so.
Maybe,you should do some type of executive order and stop this type of child abuse and nonsense ongoing in this country, Some of this is involved in immigration practices so men are able to come to this country and become legal citizens.

3. Day 731 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency – Halfway Point) - Con Man Donald J Trump will have another Photo-Op with Kim Jong Un in VIETNAM... Deferment Donald aka Coward Donald will be going to Vietnam after all. REMINDER - Robert Mueller and John Kerry are actual Vietnam War Heroes...  https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-and-kim-jong-uns-upcoming-summit-will-be-in-vietnam
But your party had control of the houses to pass this bill......now you wanna play victim. Gtfo here you fraud
No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.   STOP hurting our own citizens - it is IMMORAL.
Seriously?! Work permits and social security numbers for illegals so we can attain the border security we want and demand?! NO! Do not cave to the dems!!! You KNOW what we the people want and deserve!
5. Day 731 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency – Halfway Point) - Friendly REMINDER - The President of the United States of America, Donald J Trump, is currently an Unindicted Co-Conspirator.

If not for the protection of the Office of the Presidency, Donald J Trump would have been arrested and there would be a mugshot of him for HISTORY to record...  https://www.wonkette.com/relax-everyone-donald-trump-is-still-a-f-cking-criminal

Go trump!!! News on the ground is better than news from the tv
Places like your Mar-A-Largo which hires illegals should be given stiff penalties. If places like Trump Enterprises are given huge fines for hiring them they will stop entering the US.
You are an Angel Mr. Trump !
The number of families affected will grow daily... The politicians need to stop fighting the fact there is a problem. Denial will kill

Let's not forget 3 things. 1. A bipartisan DACA deal was already on the table when he walked away from it. 2. The shutdown started under a REPUBLICAN Congress. 3. The only person keeping the government shut down right now is Mitch McConnell, who refuses to hold a vote.
TRUMP just please declare a National Emergency... Use your Power and end this...  All the workers and their families.... Over ride the democrats and get the job done....

I’m currently watching a tv show called  border force America’s gate keepers. You should be ashamed as you are locking up unaccompanied children crossing the border from Mexico, I understand that you don’t want or need drugs and weapons crossing the border, but these are innocent children, and you decide to lock them up. Shame on you trump 😡  You are the most corrupt person currently on this planet, you need to be taken out of your position, and very soon
These children are not locked up, they are living in a dormitory setting with beds, food, clothing and medical care.  They are being taken care of better than their own families who abandoned them.
with a key that opens the door, inside the door is 6 or so children sleeping in the floor, disgusting abuse

Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
If you're the President for America maybe you should start listening to the majority instead of you minority base. https://www.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-poll-ocasio-cortez-ideas-for-trump-border-wall-money-2018-12?fbclid=IwAR1lAk_R3XBVvL-rETCXRFUAyFjvQEkHlNVt2bEtOEJ0vOLiDwN8MAFialQ

WHO is behind supplying all these conveniences all of a sudden to ALL THESE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ? I think its critical to find out an EXPOSE WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE..THANK YOU GOD BLESS
Wow you created these problems at the border and now you don't know how to fix it. So typical from someone who so stupid and should never have been president.

No to Donnie Trump's vanity wall! Donnie Trump sign the bipartisan legislation to reopen the government and pay our first responders their earned salaries! We know you like to walk away from responsibilities and not pay salaries to workers you owe! How many times did you declare bankruptcy and stiff employees? I think the shutdown is your way of trying to prevent congressional oversight! It's not going to work Donnie!
But, you lied about Mexico paying for it so now you want the US tax payer to foot the bill.

Fred Trump, Sr. Congratulations. You raised a fine son in Donald Trump. You instilled in him hard work pays off. He is a very smart man. A kind and caring heart comes easy to him. He says what he thinks and doesn’t water it down. Just don’t cross him. He is brilliant in negotiating techniques and World leaders are learning he means business. The USA has never had a business man for our President before. It’s wonderful and we know he loves us and is working for us when we are sleeping. Our economy has grown and people who had been laid off are back to work. Businesses are caring for their employees and even giving bonuses. There’s some people who don’t like him because he is a “different” kind of President and he is definitely “in charge.”  He brings with him his beautiful and gracious wife First Lady Melania Trump. She is such an asset to him and the whole world loves her. Children are drawn to her and she is thriving. We have the best chance we have ever had to have a prosperous nation because he brings family that are loyal and talented is so many ways.  He is not liked by everyone because he does things his way, not the way it has been being done. You started him young and he accepted your training. We are a grateful nation and know you would be as proud of him as we are. Prayers daily for President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Second Lady Karen Pence. The Administration is successful even with all the resistance and obstruction from the opposing party. I applaud you for your success and we are blessed to reap the benefits.

We are a grateful nation and know you would be as proud of him as we are. Prayers daily for President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Second Lady Karen Pence. The Administration is successful even with all the resistance and obstruction from the opposing party. I applaud you for your success and we are blessed to reap the benefits.

Build the wall. It is a necessity if we want our children, their children and the future generations to have a chance at a drug free life. It will also help contain human trafficking. There will always be crime, yet this will have a crippling impact on crime. Linda, Texas
Linda Lopez WHAT?
Why is anyone blaming Trump? He is at work in the White House .... Our representatives should be required to work too or no pay... I can’t tell my boss I’m not gonna do what you want or negotiate with you on what’s expected and still get paid! It is a shame that workers are caught in this but blame who is at fault, Trump has made several suggestions to open and start negotiations... I don’t know one person that does not have a fence around their property ! Secure the borders, and let people enter legally....
Pelosi is not only bad for our country, she's a coward to boot.
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing   #Edmund Burke  And I do think the good men and women are tired of doing nothing. That's why (we) I voted for you Mr President and will stand by you in 2020 God bless you and your family..🙏🏾🙏🙏🏼🇺🇸 Build the Wall already..
God help us🙏 President Trump really need our prayer 🙏 Fighting evil to save our great country! Women marching to kill babies lord have mercy on our souls 🙏If you voted for a democrat you vote to kill babies😪😪
Whose going to pay for the wall?  https://www.facebook.com/1087167058116488/posts/1188671814632678?sfns=cl
Schumer and Pelosi are not only Anti-Trump, they are Anti-America, they support Sanctuary Status, open borders, and want to abolish ICE. Trump shut down Government but Pelosi and Schumer are responsible for the continued shut down. The funds for the wall are a drop in the bucket compared to what it costs us to support Illegal Aliens, and that cost is growing with every new one that comes. Not only do they get housing assistance food stamps (EBT), free education, free healthcare, and more monthly income than American Citizens do. Illegals get TAX REFUNDS !!!!!! They also send OUR money back to their homeland! Now someone please, explain to me why we do not have a wall???
Democrats have no interest in our country. Drive them out

I’m just curious.  Would a wall have stopped the criminal gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, from fighting? (No) https://youtu.be/uVspqShcXSA
Just go to her FB page and comment on it!
Pelosi is out of touch with reality.  She must be sent for a mental evaluation.  The safety of our country is at stake.  Democrats must rebel and oust her immediately
Lara Trump I want a wall. I also wish you would see the HSUS and GREY2K for the scumbag liars they are, and break from their propaganda based destruction.  Greyhound people have lost their way of life and the dogs they love. And so many potential  future greyhound owners won't have these amazing pets. LOOK FOR THE FACTS!
🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕FUCK TRUMP THE RAPIST .....
No wall. Better security measures are available. Experts tell you. You are such a stupid man.
Deport Melania since you hate immigrants
We are making a pledge to impeach and imprison you asswipe
Marie Garcia Specifically, what in my post showed ignorance?  BTW, I'm Independent!
Why are you making harder for people who aren't white to come to our country? If you streamlined the system then a lot of the people could be legal. People who want to be here to make a living and make our country better, like the immigrants before them. Making it harder causes more people to feel like the only way out of their horrible situation is to sneak into our country. We are not a big friendly neighbor anymore. We are the big bully who lives next door who has poisoned the water and killed the parents! Our history in Central and South the United States of America has caused a lot of these people's pain and suffering. Before any of you reply with your snowflake, right wing, whining agenda, try studying about what has happened since Reagan was in office. And try using actual facts. Not Fox, Breietbart or other federalist nonsense!
You need a mental checkup.  Losing a child is bad hand Americans are killing more often than immigrants.  This is false equivalency. You are always lying . Your Pinocchio nose is longer than your red ties.
trump’s temper tantrum shut down is not helping our great country or our people....He is a disgrace....
On Judge Janine last night she show a picture of the Angel Families holding pictures of their lost loved ones as the families were trying to get in to see schumer....he refused to see them. On the other side of the tv screen there was a picture of schumer and one of his cronies holding pictures of 2 federal employees (I presume) who have been furloughed. HOW IS GODS NAME CAN HE EQUATE THE TWO LOSSES. THAT BASTARD HAS NO CONSCIENCE.  SORRY rant over..but he made my blood boil. 😡😡😡😡
Thank you President Trump! We are supporting you 100%. Shame on Pelosi and fellow democrats for not wanting to protect their USA citizens. Who cares who pays for the wall?  It’s costing us billions of dollars to pay for illegal immigrants NOW! They are scamming the IRS receiving thousands of dollars with fraudulent claims and IRS knows this but won’t stop it!
Build the Wall! Stay strong Trump!
But most people with a brain don't Donald, only you and your minions!
Build the wall, deport all illegals
Build the wall ! Leave the Democrats out! Build the wall , call our Military out Build the wall!
her The American people, Tramp, is a criminal terrorist
We are making a pledge to impeach and imprison you asswipe
Build the wall. No amnesty for those who started here illegally. Send a message. Do it right
Trump shouldn’t have to fight for border security - it is the only decent thing to do. Pelosi is immoral and I believe she drinks too much. She does not serve the people - she only serves the illegals and criminals.
Well...  STOP THE INVADERS BEFORE THEY CROSS OUR BOARDER.
Liar Fraud  Traitor  Thief  Criminal  Moron
If I were you I would give those DACA idiots permanent residency to shut dems mouth and then see what will be the arguments not to give you the money for border security and the wall!!
Build the Wall Sir and no Amnesty
How do we in America have politicians that are anti-America, ad refuse to protect our citizens from illegals crossing our borders ad allowing them to take what we worked for and make it theirs, assaulting, raping, murdering innocent Americans by protecting the illegals and demanding OPEN BORDERS?  This is just a deliberate act by those Democracks, to flood America with foreigners and giving them the right to vote for them without being citizens.  This is an atrocity to Americans, and abomination to our country ad the lives of our AMERICAN CITIZENS.
Welllll...... You're failing. Worst president in U.S. history.  LOCK HIM UP!!!
You know I don't care about the freaking wall anymore or any of their proposals or plans! I care about the American people. Isn't  the lower and middle class taking  the hit for this they are the ones suffering from this dag burn government shutdown. I wash my hands of the republicans and democrats.   What's going to become of those surviving off of food stamps?  What's going to become of the multitude that have basically lost their job due to this shutdown? They may be working but they aren't reaping no benefits. I mean if it goes on that's a lot of loss and destruction for so many many families, single men and women, children, etc.. oh well I babbled but my heart is heavily burdened and restless over this.
You are a traitor.  You belong in prison.
her The American people, Tramp, is a criminal terrorist
Don't give up and don't give in . No deal with our some sort of wall/barrier . Can't trust the democrats to deal after government is open , and the can will continue to be kicked down the road .
Enforce our laws on illegal aliens, no jobs, no welfare! They will go home!
By the way, I know you hate FACT CHECKING, but San Diego does NOT have a border wall, and that is NOT why it is such a safe city! Idiot! I cannot believe #45 is "in charge" of this country. To the Trumpers- how much ignorance can you actually put up with>????? it is pathetic when you have people like Ted Nugent saying to "shoot Democrats like coyotes". (Newsweek) YES, he said that and he is the one who has much for brains, not the Parkland students! This is one of the people that #45 listens to, but oh it will not be his fault if some nut case takes a gun and starts mowing people down. And, it is a 98% chance it would be a WHITE male between the ages of 19 and 26. Again, that is a FACT, and I know you hate that word! Get a damn clue!
This lady and others lost there Children and there are ones on here with there laughing emoji ‘s.  How sad and pathetic these people are who send these , not a laughing matter . You may not like the truth as it is told to you, or Our President but have some common decency
I hire illegal immigrants in my business.
Fix our broken immigration system. No Wall
It’s time for Pelosi to go. The women is off her rocker. I truly don’t understand how anyone can take her serious or back her.
Most people who oppose the wall are doing so because we know it won’t work and is a waste of money. Our money. Your money. Do some research on the real reason Trump wants this wall. Never forget that wealthy people help other wealthy people and have no qualms about doing so from the sweat off your backs. Also look into our current border deterrents and the terrain over which he wants to build the wall. Please also consider that drugs are being smuggled in large shipments, by freight lines and other commercial transports that are coming through ports of entry, not in the backpacks of individuals crossing the border looking for asylum. This isn’t about left or right politics. It’s not about race (unless you make it so) for the opposers. It’s about common sense. Don’t waste my hard earned taxes on this eminent failure and symbol of hate.
refugees? i call bs. MAYBE and handful as a percentage MIGHT be some form of refugee, but the vast majority crossing the border are no more a refugee than you or i. do things the LEGAL way. as for children being separated from their parents - wake up. obama did that too and i didnt see anyone whining about it. you know what happens to CITIZENS with children that do illegal crap in this country? they lose their children too. don't want to lose your kids? don't do illegal crap. obey the law. it is an insult to people waiting to enter this country legally to be productive citizens to keep allowing these people to flood our border, drain our public resources, over burden our schools, hospitals, and police departments. the ONLY reason the democrats fight so hard to allow illegal immigration to continue is because treasonous sanctuary cities/states ALLOW people that are not citizens to vote in our elections and be named in the us census which determines representation in state/federal government, among other things, and they are too ignorant to realize that they are pawns to the democratic party.
Build the wall one murder from illegals is to many
You are a traitor.  You belong in prison.

Barbara Blitfield Pech sorry but I am not a politician, and I am not a moron, BTW what is a politician moron?   So exactly what was wrong with the post I made, I know that I did not believe very much of what Bill Clinton, or Barack Obama promised, they lived up to my expectations!  So far most of what Trump can deliver on his promises, he has delivered, he has not yet delivered on promises that are dependent on congress and treasonous democrats, Trump has integrity, or he never would have succeeded as a business man.   We have a long history of liberal democrats lying to the people, and not giving a damn if they keep their promises.   Up until now the problem with republicans is they do not have the balls to fight the traitors known as democrats, that is until Trump!   Oh if possible name 10 democrat politicians with integrity, who are actively working for the American people, and not just shouting Heil Hussein when their leaders tell them to!

A wall is a tool in MANY necessary steps to fix this issue.  Period. It's a deterrant, not a fix all.
Tim Christ you are a politician moron
I will vote for a temporary wall in exchange for a temporary extension of DACA
Build the wall.  If you have to declare a National Emergency, do it!  Whatever it takes to get it done.  Not next week, not next month, or next year.  Every day that is delayed gives Pelosi and Schumer that much longer to dig their heels in.  She has already said even if the government shutdown ends, she will still oppose funding the wall.  What more does the President need?  Speaker Pelosi is going to do whatever she can to see that her party gains full power for 2020.
Nobody wants open borders, dumb ass. The crisis is fake
Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace to our country, and the same goes to Chuck Schumer...
Quit using us. We are not your pawns   https://www.facebook.com/142380607326/posts/10155924403507327/
Tell Nancy if we only use technology to secure our borders, it will use facial recognition technology which means EVERY illegal immigrant will have their data stored on all law enforcement computer databases countrywide. What does that mean? That means that ICE will be able to tap that database to locate, detain and deport many many more illegals than a simple low tech wall. Does Nancy really want to go down that path?
Princess Pelosi has no heart for her fellow Americans.

Reno Nevada just had an illegal brutally murder 4, 1 man and 3elderly women and rape them! And Jerry and Sherri were the most amazing and giving people!Build the wall Mr President! And stop Steve Sisolak from making our state a sanctuary state! My friends who were murdered by this scum need vengeance!!!!
Impeachment / indictment is your future.  Most of Your minions are just too stupid to realize they been had by a NY charlatan.   Hopefully they will get pissed off and move somewhere more to their liking,  Siberia !
You made a promise to your base..not all Americans
Build the WALL, anything less is unAmerican
Nancy is not listening. And hasn’t been since 1981. She needs to be removed.
This hussy has not got time for the angel moms but she has time to tell people that we need to give more money and put these DACA kids through free schools now I think it is time we impeach the skanky Broad and do not give her any pensions put her out to pasture and put her out of office and anybody that follows her goes with her.
Lying fool keeps repeating himself.
Nancy should know better...as a woman looking in these moms eyes and seeing the pain...and many more to come if we dont put up the wall stop letting more criminals in this country we have enough already
Build the wall and secure our borders
🐑
We don’t need a wall. The majority of American don’t believe we need it. Time for you to give up Trump. #TrumpLies
I just heard on the news another illegal immigrant that's been here for a year illegally has killed four people in Nevada so you lefties want open borders
30 days,  R.I.F. time. Cut the Federal Fat!
Nobody wants open borders, that’s just another political lie from Trump.  His “wall” is impossible to build and will accomplish nothing, that’s the truth.  You should fear a leader willing to terrorize his own people - you may be next.
Good morning. Mr.  President. I pray that the  democrats will see that what we need is the wall not only to protect. America but to also protect the people who want to come here legally and have a better life..the ones who are fighting you on everything are selfish and greedy and have been in the government to long.they need to retire and stop being so nasty about everything..  God is watching and they will answer for it on judgement.day just like us all when we stand before. God..there is. Nothing in this world worth going.to. he'll for an eternity..to me they are evil and don't care about anyone but themselves... I thank. God for.you and your leadership ..  I just hope you don't give up on us. I will pray for.you.and our. Vice. President that. God.will give you strength to carry one. His will
You guys can take the walk and shove it up your candy ass
lets also make sure we stop giving financial aid to non citizens and make sure OUR money goes to citizens FIRST, cut off all foreign aid
well DIPWAD....you DIDN'T fix it....you have MADE IT WORSE.  How long do you think those border guards are going to work effectively without getting paid.  They will be out there looking for OTHER JOBS sooner than you think if they don't sue you for breach of contract before then.  And how about the coast guard.....they can't sue you, but they damn well can make sure that boat load of cocaine or heroin can just pass them on by.  Why should they put themselves in danger when you refuse to pay them ?????

"no tickee no shirtee" from a 1920's movie. no paychecks-no work...put the people back to work with due pay--no negotiations until that is done. Sick of you people holding the "peons" hostage ...using them like a bargaining chip.
Nancy Anastasia Lawrence WHAT?
‪Trump has a history not paying workers. Withholding wages to make demands.‬  ‪Now he’s trying his ransom tactics as President.Taking federal paychecks as hostage. Using Americans as bargaining chips.‬  ‪For or Against a Wall,‬ ‪He is WRONG!‬  ‪No “negotiations”‬ ‪He must End his shutdown!‬
Why are we letting one crazy idiot woman hold all of America hostage. Keep calling her out somehow she has to go
stay on them till they puke folks!
Have Nancy and Chuck met with any of these victims to console them?
Build.the wall around MAGA brats disrespecting American Veterans
No,us citizens have taxes too high now. Can't affort a wall
I'm from Canada and it's not hard to see who the issue is!  That old Pelosi bitch should go out to pasture!  It would be nice if our young  Trudeau bitch could go with her!!
This is what its all about. Yet the obstructionists on the left claim that its a manufactured crisis while ignoring the family members of relatives of people killed by illegals. Its just shameful.
MAGA shitbags.  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6612571/He-just-blocked-way-Native-American-elder-Vietnam-veteran.html

Nancy Anastasia Lawrence WHAT?
Hey idiot.....most that live on the border don't see a crisis.  You can dig under a wall or fly over it.  Most drugs come in through checkpoints.  Most illegals don't come from Mexico.  You are the dumbest and most evil president ever.  You and your family need to go to Russian where you belong since you are all Russian Agent Traitors.  Most hated presdient ever.  There - you are the greatest at something.  Being Hated.
Build the wall, vatican has it, rich have it, White house has it, you lock your doors hine, in car, why? You think is why and know why. Common sense. Let them come legally.
Comment by Virginia's husband a 22 year Navy veteran. In my opinion, instead of canceling Pelosi and her gaggle's departure flight to Afghanistan....it would have been more effective to cancel their RETURN flight. MAGA...BUILD THAT WALL!!!
My dad  may have it right. Makes sense! His comment here is from another post.  It is clear to me now that it's all about the 2020 Election.  His comment:  What the wall and sanctuary cities and states are actually about is filling the states with bodies for the 2020 census. States get representatives based on the number of people -- legal or illegal -- in their state every ten years. The more people the more seats in Congress a state has. States also get money for projects based on the census. Democrats as a whole are digging in on the immigration problem as a whole only because this year is the last year they can stack the census with bodies. Although, it doesn't hurt that they can make President Trump look bad in the process. Don't look for the Demoncrats to cave on the wall or any illegal immigration issue this year.
Build the wall. Do not let these caravan people into our country.
Build the wall! ALSO institute legislation for immediate death penalty for anyone attempting murder on a police officer! I am sick of seeing the death of our LEOs at the hands of criminals! PLEASE, please put this at the top of your list POTUS.
Build the wall! America needs this to protect ourselves.
Do you not realize that this happens with legal Americans as well? It is a flaw in our justice system not a flaw because it was an illegal immigrant. This is a judicial flaw not an immigration flaw. Fix the problem with our courts so that all repeat offenders and law breakers are stopped not just illegal immigrants.

American's be reminded Hairy Diarrhea Mouth Baboon Trump caused the shutdown, same Bill last month,he signs yesterday,what stuns me your information,that Democrats did not talk to Angel Families,also all the information about Democratics,media,your negatives to everyone that disagrees with you and Hairy Diarrhea Mouth Baboon Trump,campaign promise Mexico will pay for the wall.
Surely their is funding somewhere for the completion of the wall and a military presence there, and get people back to work without having to depend upon the Deplorable Dems. Those who came illegally should be deported unless they apply for asylum at THEIR US embassy where they can be heard quickly and be housed and protected in lieu at that site until their onsite asylum hearing.NO BENEFITS for those who cross illegally, they should be deported to their local US embassy immediately.

Well how about telling the President to stop babying the Dems. Open up the government and put a freeze on all spending and hiring.  Close ALL THE borders until the immigration laws are changed by congress and start DEPORTING everyone who is here illegally.
After what they just turned down Don't give them anything. Nothing
25 million illegal immigrants are in the United States it's time to find them all tag them all and ship them back or place their asses in life imprisonment
Also made a pledge that Mexico  was paying for your stupid wall!
TRUTH - It is terrifying to think that almost every single air traffic controller in the United States is currently distracted at work because they don't know when their next paycheck is coming. Think about that the next time you get on an plane. Oh, and how do you think TSA workers are feeling, working without pay?
Pelosi is a major player in the destruction of the democratic party.  They do nothing for the people and eventually the brainwashed masses we realize they have supported the wrong people for a long long time.
Fix our Broken Corrupted Government First .
All people coming here should  have to have a sponsor to help them . No gov assistance .we can't hold all the people that want to be free and must help fix their country .WE have the greatest country in the world lets not let college educated idiot's destroy it!!!
You know what he really needs to worry about who's going to bomb us next like 9/11 and everything else I think our borders are safe and secure we haven't had no issues with New Mexico at all he really needs to focus on people with ISIS people in other countries that might be planning on trying to bomb us or to do something why should New Mexico have to pay for a wall or want some type of freedom when they have never done nothing to us in the past 32 years that I have been alive New Mexico has never attacked us New Mexico has never done anything wrong you need to really worry about Germany Korea and the countries that will actually try to do some type of nuclear bomb on us this is the reason why I never vote

illegal immigration equals democrat votes...Thats the only reason Nancy wants open borders...She does not care anything about their well being...Mt President Donald J. Trump. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Go Trump go! The blame for the government shutdown is no longer on you! It’s on Nancy Pelosi! Some times, when you’re dealing with cold hearted people, you have to get rough in order for them to see your meaning! She is definitely anti-Christian and DOES NOT stand for our country. BUT...PRAISE GOD THAT WE HAVE A MAN WHO WILL! Thank you #Trump for everything you’re doing. Right now it may hurt some people, but in the end it’ll help EVERYONE! Thank you, GOD for this man! Continue to use him, Lord!
Two more caravans on the way . Someone is funding them and need to be prosecuted. Millions estimated to arrive on open field this year according to Spanish media last year.
You’re all so blind. Fuckin Idiots
Check this bullshit out share share share
During his sad speech Trump cited his usual impeccable sources: "some say", "many people say", "the voices in my head said", "Baby Ann Coulter said", "experts who don't exist said", "a Mom in Wyoming who I just invented told me" and "the genie who lives in my golf bag testified"  https://twitter.com/PaulRudnickNY/status/1086743098850533376
We need to fix our broken Democrats too.
OK. Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are not going to give in, even after the offer of the DACA compromise, so now it is time. Declare the State of Emergency due to our unsecured borders. More caravans are coming. Stop this madness. We are all behind you, Mr. President. Do it now or at the State of the Union address, just do it. Our nation's security depends upon it. Build the wall!
Build the wall take California back , ballance thier budget, get thier education back up.put the state on probation, if they dont agree cut all funding..

I am sick and tired of illegals coming into this country and using the system to their benefit.  Don't just build the wall, deport any and all illegals the hell outta here, they are a stain on the underlying pants of society.
both of you are stupid cunts
The Statue of Liberty welcomed every ship bound for Ellis Island, it’s size and position in the harbor shouted Welcome to the United States of America.   Those emigrating  to this country PAID (yes, paid!) to board a ship as a passenger at their port of departure. There was never a guarantee that their paid passage would not end up with one or all of their family members being returned. They were not required to have a passport or visa. However, they were REQUIRED to enter this country LEGALLY. Incoming ships to the port of New York were stopped at a small island off the coast of Staten Island prior to being received at Ellis Island. Inspectors would board the ships to vet passengers who were deemed mentally or physically ill or any who were involved in criminal activity. Those passengers deemed a threat to the well being of our country, were NOT gained entry. The remainder of the passengers were forwarded to Ellis Island where they were processed. Thousands of immigrants arrived daily to Ellis Island and in most cases their processing took only a few hours and then immigrants were released to acquire citizenship (which most did) Those who were cleared to enter the USA were directed to rail transportation in order to connect with their DOCUMENTED SPONSOR. Immigrants waiting to be processed were afforded the opportunity to BUY ( yes buy - not given) food at the Ellis Island commissary after exchanging their currency.  Those who were detained for health reasons were placed in a holding pattern and were given food and drink for free. If a child over the age of 12 was denied entry due to illness, they were sent back to their country of origin ALONE via ship. Those under 12  who were not deemed healthy enough to stay were SENT BACK to their country of origin with one parent. Children and adults requiring any type of medical attention were sometimes held in the infirmary and were CHARGED A FEE (Yes they paid) for any medical services. My great grandparents along with millions of those who emigrated here from various countries did so by LEGAL means and were not afforded a free ride, nor did they expect anything for free except entering a country where all citizens lived freely.  When they arrived, family took care of family. I am proud of my Italian/Irish ancestry. Reopen Port(s) of legal entry similar to Ellis Island and apply those same rules. In addition, those who fail to enter legally through the legal port(s) of entry will be denied citizenship forever and remain deported.  Allow all illegals presently living here to be processed in a similar fashion.  If they have been receiving assistance from the government and have not obtained work,  make a mandatory military service of 2 years minimum to gain immediate citizenship. Any new citizen convicted of a major crime within one year of obtaining a citizenship will be deported. As an employee working at the World Trade Center, I survived two terror attacks. How I remember the flags waving and the “we will never forget” signs, post 9/11. How quickly everyone forgets. I will never forget the numerous funerals I attended, nor the fear I still live with to this day from what I witnessed. Welcome to the United States of America to all those who wish to do so legally and are willing to give back to this country by working and making this great land of immigrants a prosperous and safe place for future generations.   God Bless the USA!!
The DemonRats are like major obstacles & dead ends in Trump's way.They know the truth & they know what's going on at the southern border, but Nancy & Chuck the schmuck, want Trump to fail & that's why they're saying NO to everything he wants. I believe Trump will do what's right for his country because unlike the DemonRats, he really cares & will do what he has to do, NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!
Pay no mind to these leftist lunatics. Build that wall!
There should be a law forbidding shutting down the government.  Those in violation of this law should be removed from office and jailed.
Mr. President we stand behind you in this effort.  Please stop these caravans and every incentive that brings them here. Find and arrest those who are funding this attack n the United States under the guise of oppression....every country in the world has oppression and we can't fix all their problems.  We need to start helping U.S. citizens first!  So tired of our money given to sanctuary cities...abortion rights groups.....and  supporting those who come here illegally and thrust their flags and middle fingers in our faces!.   I would like to stop all aid to these countries who don't take care of their own people. Stop the anchor baby program......no other country has this! Use your executive privilege soon before it's too late. Our people need to go back to work and shouldn't suffer another day w/o paychecks.
Please check out what happened in our Small town in Nevada!Another illegal immigrant taking 4 innocent lives.Build the Wall!

Build the Wall, Tall and Beautiful , the Democrats better start working as a team to negotiate or I can tell you this much, either way they have no chance against my man Trump in 2020, but they will just look like even more of fools come next election .

Exterminate the Satan Evil axis Kim Jong Un. Never co-operate with the demons. I said this more than 1,000 times.

Politicians getting paid while front line doesn’t, What a screwed up system, 4 billion for a wall can’t be anymore ludicrous then the other stupid crap going on.
David Williams , FACTS Printed, able to verify asking because worked in that field for 20 years . How about 4 generation in one family milking the system that fine with you , getting benefits just by getting a doctor signing a letter another mom and 4 kids collecting money they never paid into making more money in a month then I did $4000 and then being told that if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have a job last name Conner

DEMOCRATS ARE SO FUCKING STUPID.
That dumb cunt wont listen
STOP ALL AID $ being sent to Mexico. They are using OUR tax $ that is being given as foreign aid to HELP these illegals get to the border! We can USE that money to build the WALL!!!!!
They are filing taxes I'm Indiana an other states with fake social security numbers getting over 10,000.00 back in taxes claiming over 10 kids in Mexico. An they don't even have kids. Stop giving our income tax money away. Build a wall. Stop the flow. Most American don't get but 3 thousand back in taxes. The Mexican are stealing our tax dollars in all lower state the proof is on whistle blower.
It’s pretty shameful that the dems were calling for more border control when they had a president in the White House , but now they are so butt-hurt that they lost, they don’t care about anything except going against what our current president asks for. Even at the cost of our own people. When does it stop?  These people need term limits. They’ve  had too much power for far too long.
SENT THE CROOKED MAFIA BITCH TO GITMO
Expel every single one who is here illegally. Let's start there!
Hey, Obama picked up a catastrophe from the last GOP pres. Reagan was a butcher in Central America, He didnt answer for iran Contra and Emptied Social Security... all great CHRISTIANS. Trump is born again Jun 2016, won the nomination Jul 2016 and is the prophet foretold in Daniel chapter 8.  Can the GOP get any more devious.. oh wait..it certainly will.
Nancy. Pelosi. )The wicked witch of the west. You have mid-stage dementia. Trump is the BEST President.   Build the wall !!  Take care of our veterans before ILLEGAL immigrants !! Wait to see what amazing things Trump does when. (. not if ) he is re-elected.
Nancy does not care about anybody. You can tell by her shaking head, hand motions and the way she acts there is a definate mental problem and Schumer is just scared of her. Build the wall keep our country safe you all wanted it before but because killer Hilary lost now you don’t want to do anything for your country

What's wrong with wanting to protect American citizens? Why are Dems so interested in helping illegals and not our own homeless and veterans? The illegals are getting paid to be here given benefits we cant obtain free education

That is enough, the dumb bitch. Should be ran out of Washington and removed from Speaker at least !
The government needs to stop paying out to illegals by giving them welfare, jobs, etc. And instead use the money they'd save on the wall!!! Illegals shouldn't be receiving welfare, getting jobs, receiving tax refunds or any thing period.
The Democrats don’t care nothing about this moms son that got killed my and they don’t care how many men and woman die trying to keep America safe only the Democrats care about is the 2020 election 🗳 and gaining there control back and there power back that’s all people wake up and take back your America god bless America
Stay strong build the wall, drain that swamp and maybe you can even help those democrats clean their house
Now what do you say Democrats?  How do you look at a mother and tell her her child doesn’t matter because an illegal alien killed them?  I’m waiting...
Take the welfare and tax return s they claim kids still in Mexico
American citizens are being forced to work without pay to satisfy a narcissist's egoism and can't get needed medication or pay their mortgage. Paul Ryan was Speaker of the House for two years. Who in their right mind would wait until Nancy Pelosi took over to ask for money for a wall? I guess it would have been more embarrassing to be turned down by a Republican house. Children have died in our custody at the border. The stock market is collapsing due to tariffs and tax cuts destroying people's pensions. Safety protections for workers are attempting to be dismantled. American troops were killed in Syria by ISIS after he wrongly said ISIS was defeated. He is friends with murderous dictators in numerous countries and disrespectful to the leaders of democracies. The list is almost endless. If you still support Trump you aren't paying attention.
Not Enough. Look, Boss, I'm sorry, but, these bastards have to be deported and their enablers, the "sanctuary state" secessionists, must be vanquished.

Americans want a wall just like the one in San Antonio that Trump says works so well.
So... you want 5.6B... and for that you shut down the USG, and by doing that, put our securety at higher risk then before?? You must be a special kind of stupid, ain't ya?
Open the government and stop being such a coward.
What about all the lives lost I. These mass shootings that have taken place in movie theaters, concerts, high schools and elementary schools, colleges, churches and bars. ALL COMMITTED BY WHITE MALE Americans!!! Why doesn’t he EVER talk about that?! He talks about the officer that was killed by an illegal immigrant the day after Christmas. But has he even spoken of the Officer Natalie Corona only 23 years old who was shot and killed two days later by a white man who was American?! Why hasn’t he addressed that? Because it contradicts everything he stands for! This nation is built on imagination! His own grandparents are immigrants! But of course they are the right color of immigrants. This is indigenous land!! Yet he makes every white person feel entitled to treat anyone of color horrible. Just like those horrible kids mocking a Native American veteran out of pure hate. That’s is what this man is doing to our country. He is filling it with hatred.
How many trillions have been spent on wars, and now socialists want to open the boarders and invite the war here. My small community was pummelled with rapists and murderers because LEGAL immigrants came from WAR TORN COUNTRIES and bring the hate and violence with them. WHO SCREENED THESE PEOPLE?!?!
It's time for American people to pull Nancy and Chuck out of their "Rat holes" to do what taxpayers have been paying them to do. People are power, they are our servers. We all should stand behind our President Donald Trump and raise our voices to demand Nancy Pelosi to BUILD THE WALL with any cost from our tax dollars or step down. We don't need a Speaker who act and behave against American people. The Rats should get over the fact that President Donald J Trump is their President, stop playing political games that only TRAITORS do. Trump 2020🇱🇷

Donald J Trump...Mr President Trump,  The Democrats and all your enemies may seem like "many" because they are loud, obnoxious  critical, disrespectful, fit-throwing cry babies just like when one tiny baby can cry, whine and throw fits and drown out an entire family. WE, the Republicans and all your supporters, may seem like "few" because you dont hear much from us. We dont act stupid like the Democratic rioters, looters and cry babies. BUT, WE ARE "MANY"! We are as strong and as mean as they are, and we CAN and WILL get loud if need be. We want you to know that we strongly beside you, solid as a rock, through thick and thin. We see and understand all your efforts to make America great again. We continuously pray for you, your family and your presidency. We love you and appreciate you. We won't let let you down. Keep going strong! In Jesus' Name. IN GOD WE TRUST!!!
4 murders in our community from guess what.....an illegal immigrant.
Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace. She should have met with the Angel Families. Unfortunately, she doesn't care about these people or anyone else for that fact. Nancy is only interested in Nancy.
4 elderly people in Douglas and Washoe counties here in Nevada, were murdered in there homes in the last week. 19 year old illegal alien has been arrested for it. Please Mr President. Vindicate these murders. Build that wall.
My son Jake pass away in 2015. He had seizures that killed him,  but it was from a drug called Death Ice too. That drug came across our borders that was part of his passing. He would of not been killed if the illegals did not bring drugs from Mexico. Please build the wall for him and all that has been killed. God bless!
Now here is an idea. How about we stop handing out free health care  food stamps  and housing to the ones who come here illegally!!! I believe this would greatly reduce the flow of illegals coming here to live off the working Americam citizens.  Then maybe we can start caring for this countries homeless and hungry people.
We're done with Traitor Pelosi.  What's our next move?
Back in December, it looked like President Donald Trump and the Democrats had a deal to fund the government. Then Ann Coulter weighed in, branding the president "gutless" and “a vulgar publicity hound” for failing to deliver on his biggest campaign promise of 2016: to build a “big, beautiful” wall on the southern border, even with his party in control of both houses of Congress.  A day later, Trump informed then-House Speaker Paul Ryan he would not sign a Senate spending bill to keep the government open, triggering what's become the longest government shutdown in modern American history.     Trump is not running the USA Ann Coulter is.
Melania flew to Mar-A-lago on an Air Force Plane cost us $35k. Her secret serves people are not getting paid. This trip is so she can get a sun tan and spa treatments while 800,000 Americans are not getting paid ether. America First? No the Immigrant wife who lied about her work visa first then got herself an anchor baby and her parent citizenship first. Fox News said nothing.
Spineless Trump: according to the latest e-humnt in me. I believe, I will make you inverted to. since you like dick in your mouth, now ill see that you swallow it.  strong for venezia

#whereismitch?  You will not vote on the proposals that you signed off on two months ago because Ann Coulter is running the show. She embarrassed you and now you are playing this game.
I can’t believe our Current members of Congress do not care that citizens are being killed by illegal immigrants. We need to recognize the sea change in the Democrat Party and demand answers.....
DELUDED RUMP THINKS HIS LATEST CONGAME HAS A CHANCE OF FLYING. NOT. THE REALITY: THERE WILL BE NO WALL. THERE WILL BE NO MONEY FOR A WALL. IT IS STOOOPID. POORLY CONCEIVED. UNREALISTIC. UNWORKABLE. JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE OUT OF HIS MOUTH , A NONSTARTER
This man is the most hated in the WORLD LOCK HIM UP
Why Liberals just don’t understand these Trump Supporters   A question asked by a Trump supporter: "Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid?”  Here's what we really think about Trump supporters - the rich, the poor, the malignant and the innocently well-meaning, the ones who think and the ones who don’t...  That when you saw a man who had owned a fraudulent University, intent on scamming poor people, you thought “Fine."  That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, “Okay."  That when you heard him proudly brag about his own history of sexual abuse, you said, "No problem.”  That when he made up stories about seeing Muslim-Americans in the thousands cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center, you said, "Not an issue.”  That when you saw him brag that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue and you wouldn't care, you chirped, "knows me.”  That when you heard him illustrate his own character by telling that cute story about the elderly guest bleeding on the floor at his country club, the story about how he turned his back and how it was all an imposition on him, you said, "That's cool!”  That when you saw him mock the disabled, you thought it was the funniest thing you ever saw.  That when you heard him brag that he doesn't read books, you said, "Well, who has time?”  That when the Central Park Five were compensated as innocent men convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and he angrily said that they should still be in prison, you said, "That makes sense.”  That when you heard him tell his supporters to beat up protesters and that he would hire attorneys, you thought, “Yes!"  That when you heard him tell one rally to confiscate a man's coat before throwing him out into the freezing cold, you said, "What a great guy!”  That you have watched the parade of Neo-Nazis and white supremacists with whom he curries favor, while refusing to condemn outright Nazis, and you have said, "Thumbs up!”  That you hear him unable to talk to foreign dignitaries without insulting their countries and demanding that they praise his electoral win, you said, "That's the way I want my President to be.”  That you have watched him remove expertise from all layers of government in favor of people who make money off of eliminating protections in the industries they're supposed to be regulating and you have said, "What a genius!”  That you have heard him continue to profit from his businesses, in part by leveraging his position as President, to the point of overcharging the Secret Service for space in the properties he owns, and you have said, "That's smart!”  That you have heard him say that it was difficult to help Puerto Rico because it was the middle of water and you have said, "That makes sense.”  That you have seen him start fights with every country from Canada to New Zealand while praising Russia and quote, "falling in love" with the dictator of North Korea, and you have said, "That's statesmanship!”  That Trump separated children from their families and put them in cages, managed to lose track of 1500 kids, has opened a tent city concentration camp in the desert in Texas - he explains that they're just "animals" - and you say, "Well, OK then.”  That you have witnessed all the thousand and one other manifestations of corruption and low moral character and outright animalistic rudeness and contempt for you, the working American voter, and you still show up grinning and wearing your MAGA hats and threatening to beat up anybody who says otherwise.  What you don't get, Trump supporters in 2019, is that succumbing to frustration and thinking of you as stupid may be wrong and unhelpful, but it's also...hear me...charitable. Because if you're NOT stupid, we must turn to other explanations, and most of them are less flattering.  (Author unknown)
Stop the iligals criminals!!! Build the wall!!!
So, ILLEGAL Aliens don't claim taxes? Naw.. They claim MULTIPLE children that aren't even in our Country, and get 10's of thousands on their returns...  https://www.facebook.com/guadalupe.pena/videos/10161288925775858/  #BuildTheWall!
Evelyn Bixby WHAT?
Put the illegal aliens on a chain gang to build the wall they force America to need!
Phuck you!!!!! Your a disgrace to our country!!!!!!!
Resign you dirty grifter.
Keep that government shut down. Democrats are too stupid to come to the table ... let them own every further day of shutdown.
Mr Donald  here is a easy solution for the wall.  There is 11,000,000 plus  illegal  immigrants in USA. Give them ID, S.S# to do taxes. Permit or resident card to get a job. Good behavior  in exchange of  $3,300,000,000.00 every year. 11,000,000 immigrants  each immigrant  willing to paid $300.00 a yrs  to maintain  their papers.  11,000,000 X $300 =$3,300,000,000. Now in 10 yrs do the math.
You haven't done squat except deprive families of their paychex - WORST president EVER
There is nothing funny about this. The families deserve respect and know the American people care. Really? Someone is going to laugh when someone has been murdered? Murder in itself is illegal, illegal immigration is illegal. Everyone in government jobs will recieve back pay. You can't bring back the dead. You can only fight for the dead and realize that their life mattered.
Shut down Congress's pay until this government shutdown is resolved. They should not get played to vacation while the government is shutdown, shutdown Congress.
Lara is a cunt whore that needs to be exterminated.

WE WILL CONQUER THE COMMUNIST!
No, we don't want your stupid wall!
I have an idea President Trump, why don't you threaten to tear down the walls at the California and Texas borders.  Then we'll see just how quickly Pelosi (and all the American people that cannot see the value and necessity of having walls and security) realizes that we need them...  Anyone is welcome into our country as long as you are vetted, non-criminals, healthy, and legal.  The same process our grand, great grand, great great grand parents had to go through.  Filled out the proper paper work, quarantined until well, became legal and paid taxes, and turned away if they were criminals.  It is much, much easier for the Cartel and terrorists (from all over the world) to get into our country from Mexico.  This is really scary America!  We need security at our borders, people!
I want USA safe and free from socialism, communism and other threats. Build the wall.
We need the damn wall up put it up or close the border.
Your not fixing anything your just making a jackass of yourself and of America
Build the wall! We just had an illegal immigrant murder 4 innocent people in our area. Could have been prevented.
Get rid of Pelosi she is a jerk
Secure the Nations borders Don. If 20,000 kids entered just last month. There is something going on our public is not aware of - and it's dead wrong. A burden is being excepted on top of the America taxpayer and many do not agree to foot the bill. Stop this crazy policy NOW.
You really need to learn sentence structure, it will give you some semblance of credibility.
Build the wall protect American s
God bless all the Angel Families. I regret that Nancy Pelosi chose to dishonor you and your loved ones. You have the majority behind you.  Of course Nancy Pelosi does not recognize us either.  Stand strong.
If that’s true, then arrest Shmuker and Palosi for treason and not performing their oath of office. Need to get this party started.
I WANT YOU IMPEACHMENT MOTHER FUCKER.
Fight Facebook’s targeting and suspension of users who call out the left for hate speech against the President. Facebook allows trolls like Jere Gallimore to bully and harass with impunity. Post names of all trolls who bully and harass and report these trolls en masse.  Trump supporters on Facebook must organize like they do and fight back.
How do you control China’s illegal immigrants?
That is why I voted for you and will vote for you again!  Please fix this country’s serious problem with illegal immigration!  I am all for people applying for citizenship.  If they are sneaky enough to come here illegally, what else will they be sneaky about!  My son works full time plus overtime and still has to live in my basement as this state has insane rent rates!  Why is it he pays for health Insurance, can’t afford a decent apartment, has to buy his own food yet an illegal can walk right in and have all that on my son’s dime when he can’t have that himself?
Screw them.  Deport ALL ILLEGALS and build a WALL.
Deport your illegal alien wife, parents and birther son
What about all the white me whom kill in schools ...?  This is political propaganda..no all Undocumented people are criminals...
Secure the Nations borders Don. If 20,000 kids entered just last month. There is something going on our public is not aware of - and it's dead wrong. A burden is being excepted on top of the America taxpayer and many do not agree to foot the bill. Stop this crazy policy NOW.
Pledge to humans, humans!
Latino support for Trump on the rise? Not so fast: PLEASE READ THIS!  BY RAUL REYES The Hill  With an odd echo of Sally Field's "You like me!" speech at the Oscars, Donald Trump on Tuesday touted findings from a poll that he viewed as showing a surge of approval from Latinos. “Marist/NPR/PBS Poll shows President Trump’s approval rating among Latinos going to 50%, an increase in one year of 19%. Thank you, working hard!” he Tweeted. The president also bragged on Sunday about his support from Hispanics, tweeting,“That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.”  What’s wrong with this picture? Just about everything.  If you find it suspect that Hispanics would be warming to the most anti-Latino and anti-immigrant president in history — during the government shutdown over the wall, no less — you’re right. Trump’s reaction to this polling, as well as the poll itself, does not really reflect an accurate snapshot of Latino political views.  In his Sunday tweet, the president asserted that Hispanics “know the Border issue better than anyone.” This is a presumption without evidence, and may come as a surprise to the millions of assimilated, U.S.-born Latinos who do not live anywhere near our southern border. Although Latinos certainly care about immigration, immigration issues are not necessarily the same as border issues. The questions surrounding DACA and the Dreamers, for example, have little to do with the border.  With respect to the Marist poll cited by Trump, its findings about Hispanics are worthy of some skepticism. The poll was conducted in English, which suggests it may have excluded the 36 percent of U.S. Latinos who identify as Spanish-language dominant. It was conducted only in the contiguous U.S., meaning Puerto Rico was left out. Although Hispanics constitute 18 percent of the U.S. population, the poll used a data set that was 15 percent Hispanic.  Breaking the numbers down, the poll of 1,023 people included about 154 Latinos. Think about it: 154 people were used to draw conclusions about a demographic that the Census Bureau reports numbers 58.9 million. As the website Latino Rebels commented, “We’ve done Twitter polls with more respondents.”  There is nothing wrong with including a proportional representation of Latinos in a national poll. The problems arise when a small sampling of Latinos is used to extrapolate findings about the broader Hispanic population. In statistical terms, allowing 154 individuals to stand in for 58.9 million people results in a margin of error of eight percent — a figure outside what many pollsters would consider reliable.  For what it’s worth, the same poll showed that 58 percent of Hispanics did not plan to vote for Trump, compared to 27 percent who did. Funny how the president left this finding out of his tweets.  Controversies around Latino opinion surveys are nothing new, most notably in the 2016 presidential election when Hispanic support for Trump was hotly disputed by experts. Nate Cohn pointed out that pollsters tend to sample a disproportionately Republican group of Hispanic voters, leading to results that skew right. And it is not easy to compile accurate data about Hispanics. The Latino community is diverse and surveying it requires sophisticated methodology. That’s why there are companies and organizations like Latino Decisions and the Pew Research Center devoted to this complex task. A 2018 Pew survey on the Latino community, for instance, was bilingual and used 1,501 Hispanic adults.  True, there are Latinos who support Trump, for the same reasons that other Americans do: because they are steadfast Republicans, because they admire his business background, or because they like his policies. But they are a minority among the Latino community. The best evidence we have of this can be seen in the 2018 midterm results. An estimated 69 percent of Latinos voted for the Democratic candidate, Pew reports, compared with just 29 percent who backed a Republican candidate.  Just like a majority of other Americans, a solid majority of Latinos pushed back against Trump and his policies.  In our current political climate, it’s doubtful that Trump’s approval among Latinos is soaring. While the president can still count on support from his base, it doesn’t include most Latinos — and that is not fake news.
God bless our President. He certainly did not need to put himself and family through all of this but he works tirelessly for the good of our country. The Democrats and the leftwing media constantly bash him and lie and spread false stories.  The media does not report the GDP is way up or that wages are up... unemployment is low and record low for the black community. They run with every lie and then talk about it as an impeachable offense. You’re fed this day in and day out. Sick of the lies !  Can the Left see for them selves ? Wake up for goodness sake! I hope something happens that the left wing media is forced to admit truth and stop lying! What miserable people!
Reading the holy Gospel according to saint John (2, 1-11)  Glory to you, Lord.  There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding. When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him,  "They have no wine."  And Jesus said to her,  "Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come."  His mother said to the servers,  "Do whatever he tells you."  Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus told them,  "Fill the jars with water."  So they filled them to the brim. Then he told them,  "Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter."  So they took it. And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, without knowing where it came from ---although the servers who had drawn the water knew---, the headwaiter called the bridegroom and said to him,  "Everyone serves good wine first, and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the good wine until now."  Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs at Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him.  Word of the Lord. Glory to you, Lord Jesus.
You bumb ass inconsiderate incapable unaware of you who pissing off mc Donald’s sponsoring half dead muthafucka get on my last nerves If u want a wall so bad u go over there and build that mf yo damn self ol pissy pot bitch ass nigga!
But you did NOTHING in your first two years in office! Meanwhile, more than 1,500 criminal aliens were CONVICTED of homicide and more than 3,700 CONVICTED of sexual assault. (SOURCE: Dept. of Homeland Security, testimony presented to Congress in an open hearing. July 2018) ... But you and Jared focused on getting the prison reform bill passed -- which was a high priority for Dems -- without demanding they provide funding for the wall. Pathetic.
Mr. Trump, please know that there actually really are Federal Workers who want the barrier and understand that Nancy and Chuck are the demons here. If we don’t get our next check, it’s on batshit Nancy.
Can we go around Nancy Pelosi? Can we go straight to the House Democrats, or is Nancy Pelosi the only one that can bring a measure to the floor and have it voted on?
You pledged that Mexico would pay for the wall, you pledged better healthcare for all on Day 1, you promised long term tax reform for the middle class.... That's three big strikes,  I can keep counting. Shall I start with all the witches that have plead guilty or been convicted?
What about all the white me whom kill in schools ...?  This is political propaganda..no all Undocumented people are criminals...
you are a failure you need to quit you have bankrupted yourself you're a liar a phony a cheat and there's nothing new to describe how disgraceful you are please leave America go to Russia where they have the best looking prostitutes in the world according to your buddy
Don’t back down. It’s time to break democrats once and for all. Build the wall!!!!
Just like the Orange Monster’s lie that Latinos like him, Jews should have the same concerns when embraced by the Crime Family:  “Conservative friends, a lot of you voted for Trump because of his support for Israel.   During his presidency there have been multiple acts of terrorism against American Jews, including this latest shooting in Pittsburgh. All of these actions have been taken by far right extremists (the Pittsburgh shooter blamed Jews for assisting the migrant caravan in Mexico).   My question to you is, are you willing to accept that the rhetoric of violence and hatred that Trump embraces is, at least in part, to blame for the rise in antisemetic terror? Is your support of Israel a genuine act of solidarity with the Jewish people, or are you simply choosing a side in your greater battle against Islam? Because as someone with very recent Jewish ancestry, I can assure you that the far-right has never been a friend to the Jewish people.   American Jews stood hand in hand with African Americans in their fight for equality, American Jews are an ethnic minority STILL fighting for civil treatment in this country. 71% of American Jews voted for Hillary Clinton and an even greater number will vote against Trump in 2020.   Conservative and Republican friends, the Jews are not your allies and you have proven that with your continued support of the alt-right and Donald Trump, so please do not use them for your political agenda any longer.” - Carlos Brandon, posted October 2018
Trump tweet: "To have a little of that good old fashioned global warming right now." This is the president of the United States. Mocking global warming. First of all: this is a weather event less than a month into the winter? Hello? Plus: do you understand science? You are a clear and present danger to my grandchildren. What a jackass. And folks, spare me the "cycle" bullshit, because that is nonsense. Greenland is melting now.  Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tons of ice since 1970. Ocean at record warmth. Forest dying from excessive heat/ocean pH dropping.  Fish species disappearing. “Be careful and try staying in your house,” the president tweeted. “Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right.
How about the mothers and wives of those killed by gun violence in the USA? 14,400 Americans gunned down in 2018? Are they angel mothers too? Any death is horrific. But: to exploit these women as a bargaining chip shows how little morals you people have
When will you protect our children at school? At the synagogues? At church? At bars? At work? At music festivals? At movie theatres? All slaughtered innocents by American white men w/easy access  to military weapons
Sir, with more caravans careening toward the U.S., with Mexico "helpless" (and no will) against stopping them, with Pelosi's stubbornness at the expense of Dreamers, PLEASE 1) stop ALL monies, foreign aid, etc. to Mexico and Central America until they stop offloading those they don't want onto us, including Child Tax Credits. Defund any state who uses fed gov $$$ for sanctuary or welfare for illegals.  2)  Tie the Ninth Circuit into knots if necessary; it is unconscionable that one court is the tail that wags the whole nation with injunctions. Let Jay Sekulow loose on this. Alan Sears and Mat Staver, too.  3) Prevent all money earned in the US from being wired to Mexico and Central America.  4) Since Congress has failed miserably to stem the influx or to stop their entry, do whatever it takes to repel at the border; let Mexico arrange the trips home for the illegals. "This far and no farther" at our border. 5) Discover who is funding the transportation for the illegal caravans; drag them into court, sue into oblivion. Charge for enabling crimes against the citizens of the US.  6) Allow no amnesty except if begun properly in the homeland.  7) Use cash and property seized from Mexican cartels to secure the border absolutely.  8) See if the FCC can demand the faces of the 4,000+ killed by illegals recently can be scrolled across the bottom of every screen in the nation. Enough is enough. This far and no farther.
Start dropping illegals off in Chuck and Nancy's front yard.
Pelosi will continue to hide from the truth. Idiota de Californicate-ia.

Cult talk 60% of your undercover welfare receiving Cult members don't work anyway their lazy asses blame immigrants and anyone else why they're so lazy. They don't care about work only a Irrelevant Wall.
You notice the people most vocal against the wall are people that are nowhere near the southern border?!
PUT THE MILITARY ON THE BORDER WE, THE MIDDLE CLASS - YOUR BASE- SPENT $1.5 TRILLION FOR THE MILITARY. IF YOU LOVED THIS COUNTRY, YOU WOULD NOT ALLOW ENTRY OF THESE MONSTERS COMING FOR MORE MONEY FOR BEING ON THE DOLE THAN WORKING AMERICANS MAKE OR THE AVERAGE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY LIVING FROM PAYDAY TO PAYDAY. No one in your family pays taxes and I hate you for it now. I hate you for allowing Caravans to destroy our Country on the Cheap. I hate you for not putting the Military at every inch of the Country to protect it from garbage to support forever.
Dear Mr. President, I applaud your speech yesterday.   You have shown that you are willing to compromise.   The democrats have shown that they don’t care about compromise at all.   They care about the 2020 elections! Not about American citizens.  Nancy Pelosi accused you of acting childish.   Well, SHE is the one being stubborn and acting childish and dare I say, acting like a bully!  I’m sure there are democrats who would sit down with you and work out a deal but they dare not do it because of the expected “wrath“ of Nancy Pelosi.  Here is a solution : end the shutdown and put these innocent government workers back to work immediately.  HOWEVER,  ask Nancy and Chuck and ALL OF CONGRESS to halt their pay AND THAT OF THEIR AIDES AND ENTOURAGE until a deal is worked out! Then everyone needs to work non-stop, 24 hours a day, until a mutual resolution is found that will protect US as American citizens.
Our borders need to be secured (Wall) & all those incentive's for Illegals to come must be removed now. Otherwise we'll find ourselves in this mess for the 3rd time. It sounds like there is 5,500 people in these 2 Caravan and another on it's way. I'm hearing more to come in Feb first wk. Congress Wake Up!! Call 1-800-350-6647 then press 1 it tells the government We want the Wall.
Is the pledge the same as the one where you said Mexico will pay for the wall? You do know walls won't stop this from happening, dumbass. 🙄
Illegal immigrants are far less likely to commit crimes  than native-born Americans.  The number of illegal immigrants has decreased over the past 10 years.   Dare to learn the truth  and not believe Trmp's lies.
You CHUMP supporters fail to realize if YOU are not Native American YOU ARE AN ILLEGAL..   PISS ON TRUMP and His Goons..
James Boyd WHAT?
Hey Orange 🍊 do you really think I’m stupid enough to accept your cat fishing friend requests from gorgeous women with fake profiles?  You’re dumber than I thought.  You don’t have to work for the NSA to know how to type the word netstat into cmd line
The Democrats supported “Border Security". along with a complete overhaul of our Immigration Policy, so dust off Schumer’s 2013 Bill (that the Republicans killed in the House), have Trump sign it and get Win Win Wall!!  On June 27, 2013, the Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act by a 68-32 margin ... The Bill was Not Considered by United States House of Representatives and Died in the 113th Congress!

A great negotiator would not need to hold over one million Americans hostage, causing them financial anxiety and pain in order to “negotiate.”  If that is the best approach to “negotiating” you have, you are certainly NOT even a good negotiator, let alone a great negotiator.  You told us your “strategy” in your book The Art of the Deal: “I play to people’s fantasies.”  Grow up. Stop hurting our fellow citizens to get your way.  Open the government - NOW....  Then start genuine open give and take negotiations in Congress to ID smart and effective enhancements to our border security, coupled with permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship for the DACA folk......  It is terrible for you to be hurting over one million Americans as part of your “negotiating” strategy.  No wait, it is worse than terrible. It is IMMORAL
I bet the group of families of children killed by inbred, flag waving, fake patriot extremists with war weapons is a MUCH bigger group, Having a pissing-pain contest to get yourself on Faux News and grab the orange imbecile's attention is a waste of their efforts to curb senseless murders.
What about all those families impacted my good old American born killers with guns?
We make a PLEDGE to TAKE YOU DOWN ASSHOLE!
I blame you Donald J. Trump for this shutdown.  Grow up and declare an emergency if you think it's so urgent you prick.

Over 300 illegals broke into my state of AZ this week. After attempting to dig under our pathetic little wall and getting caught, the gates were thrown open for them when they asked for asylum. 😮 This is the most messed up thing I can imagine! Trying to break in, then being allowed in when caught?! 😡
NO WALL! I HAVE NO IDEA OF what you think America was because the America I grew up with was harsh. Health care was waiting all day food was unavailable and remember sleeping in the bus station as a child. A little better now and you want to return to That hard time. You ARE AN IDIOT! IS
Mr. President, While I agree we DO need a good wall on the Southern border to help BP, the biggest issue with immigrants living here ILLEGALLY is the VISA OVERSTAYERS, that come in & refuse to leave when their time is up, they KNOW when they get that visa that it is a TEMPORARY VISIT but our Gov't has done NOTHING to them for violating U.S. Immigration LAWS! It's been a big problem for DECADES, it's not new & STILL in 2019 thee is no solution to this?? DACA protection will NOT solve anything either! Is it ONLY for those who have it now OR would you continue to grant it to more? Reagan gave the Illegals a path to citizenship & all it did was start the massive problem we have now :( They get welfare & food stamps for the ANCHOR BABIES & some even get SSD for them, we give them FEDERAL TAX ID NUMBERS to work ILLEGALLY in the USA, many "lawmakers" have enacted "Sanctuary Cities" protecting ILLEGAL CRIMINALS, my question is WHY have OUR top Gov't officials done this to Americans? And WHERE DOES IT END? Until ALL these things are addressed & stopped, Americans will continue to suffer & be robbed while those in DC, Governors Mansions, etc. are NOT affected :( SHAME ON ALL WHO LET IT GET THIS OUT OF CONTROL!!!!!
so many lies and so much garbage coming from this FAKE NEWS show! lara loves to spread the BS that comes from dumbass donnie and might go down as an accessory to his crimes!

It’s easier to tell Trump to end shutdown than to stand up to Tyranny and Tyrants. Get a backbone people. Our forefathers went through far worse to give us this country and you don’t want to be inconvenienced. Pack your kids lunches. Use your credit cards, do whatever it takes but don’t give in. Push on Trump. From a Federal Workers Family
Require every illegal immigrant pay $500.  Multipy that by 11 million illegals thats $5.5 BILLION!  The wall gets paid for by the people of MEXICO living in OUR country!  In exchange they'll receive ONE YEAR SOVEREIGNTY in the US.  Share & visit www.paytostay.us TY!
"Trump Touts Border Wall In San Antonio, Which Has No Wall And Isn't On The Border" ... you're worshiping an idiot.
Alright, let's clear some things up about this shutdown. My job literally requires me to monitor the government funding process, so let me explain what's happening here.   There are 12 spending bills that make up federal government funding. Five of the 12 were passed by the House and Senate last fall, but seven of the 12 were still pending (hence a partial shutdown).   Between October and December, key House and Senate offices met and negotiated details of the remaining 7 spending bills. When those details were worked out, they were ready to go. A two-week extension was agreed to (by both chambers) in early December to work out the final details.   In mid-December, the Senate took the first step and passed all  7 spending bills in a UNANIMOUS decision. That's right, unanimous. 100 - 0. All Republicans and Democrats voted in favor. The package gets sent to the House.  The government could have been funded here, at this very moment, had the House just passed the Senate's unanimously agreed-upon spending package. Shutdown completely avoided. But House Republicans chose not to do that.   Instead, right before the holiday break, the House decided to change the agreement (and add funding for the wall).  They passed an alternative spending package in a highly partisan vote, one that contained funding for the border wall.   So now the Senate and House have two different spending bills (that's not allowed, obviously). Government shuts down. The holiday break happens. January 3rd comes. And then we have a new session. Legislation resets.   Now read carefully because this point is very, very crucial.   Speaker Pelosi could have promoted a "liberal agenda" and advocated for a new spending package that completely gave Democrats everything they wanted. However, she chose to respect the Republican-led Senate's spending package from December. So she left 6 of the 7 spending bills the exact same, word-for-word, as they were in the Senate. Again, the Senate had unanimously voted in favor of these bills just a few  weeks prior.   The sole remaining spending bill was the one with the border wall funding. Speaker Pelosi simply issued a temporary extension on this bill so that the border wall funding could be debated without the government shutting down. Again, she didn't pass a spending bill that said "no funding for the wall". It was a temporary extension to work out the details and ensure negotiations didn't harm workers.   This solution would have, at the very least, kept most of the federal departments unrelated to the border wall open. It would also have kept DHS, TSA, etc., open throughout negotiations, at least until the extension deadline approached.   But Trump and Mitch McConnell are not letting this happen. They are advocating for all of these departments to remain shutdown (even departments that have NOTHING to do with the border).   Since then, Democrats in the House keep passing bill after bill to reopen the government, pay workers while the government is closed, etc. Mitch McConnell is not allowing any of these bills to come to the Senate. All because Trump told him to do that.   These men are monsters. And, by extension, if you support this, you are a monster. These families have become Trump's pawns. And they are suffering because of it.
What happened to Mexico paying for your stupid monument to idiocy? And hey, what about your taxes? Asshole dotard fool.

REPUBLICANS DO NOT CARE about children’s BRAINS being splattered on a school chalkboard what makes you think they care about children being RIPPED FROM THEIR MOTHERS ARMS……Illegal immigrants do have limited rights; the right to a fair trial is one of them.This is A MINOR TRESPASSING CHARGE that they not yet even been convicted of and the IDIOT REPUBLICANS think you can KIDNAP THEIR CHILDREN Hold the children HOSTAGE in a TRUMP ORPHAN CAMP to pay for for A WALL that some other country was supposed to pay for… AND THEN LOCK THE PARENTS UP for life,,,,, for the first commission of any such offense, be fined under title 18 or imprisoned NOT MORE THAN 6 MONTHS,,, or both, TRUMP and JEFF SESSIONS have publicly stated that if TRUMP WERE TO GET HIS WALL the separation of the families would be stopped IF THAT IS NOT TERRORISM in its purest form tell me what is....  These kids are going to be SOLD through RELIGIOUS ORPHANAGES for a PRICE. Any idea what a healthy pre teen child goes for on the black market ? THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE A FORTUNE even if they had to pay for their room and board which YOU and I  are paying for as TAXPAYERS,,or WORSE they may be sold for BODY PARTS,,,
The wall will do nothing you have to go to there tunnels and flush them out. The people coming to the wall are families and people trying to escape cartel.
Do not want the wall if Trump is going to give away our country to get it.   Pelosi and Schumer are working for illegal immigrants, DACAs, and the citizens of foreign countries. Nothing is on that negotiating table but our  Taxpayers' dollars and a welcome mat for all future invaders and breakers of our laws  at our expense.  It is obvious that our immigration laws mean nothing to those coming over our borders or to those who came over illegally in the past. Pelosi's and  Schumer's demands are excessive since they are representing non-citizens.  What is next?  Another amnesty like the one in 1985  that will only encourage further breaking of our laws and actually encourage illegal immigration?   Even if negotiations end, the barriers will not be put in place.  We are being controlled by  the bullying and demands of non-citizens.
VIVA LA RAZA! FK THIS BORDER FALSE MESSAGES SHOWING ON TELEVISION SHOWING LIES TO THE EYES! LETS WAKE UP SPIRITUALLY, PHYSICALLY, AND MENTALLY! WHY DID WE DEMOCRATS PAY $45 BILLION DOLLARS IN 2006 WHEN THEY HIRED A COMPANY FROM RIVERSIDE CA MOST OF THEM IF NOT ALL OF THEM WERE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS? I THOUGHT IT WAS TO KEEP THEM OUT NOT BUILD A WALL AND SAY WE DON'T LIKE ILLEGALS? WHAT KINDA STUFF IS THAT KEEPING PROFITS WHILE LYING TO OUR PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES? WHY IS THE OUR MONEY WRITTEN IN LATIN? WHY DOES IT HAVE THE YEAR THE ILLUMINATI WAS CREATED 1776. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. Donald J. Trump  I CHALLANGE YOU LOW IQ BUSINESS MEN.

If this administration truly wanted to do something about immigration they would do something about the Dreamers and they would come up with some solutions for processing immigrants at the border. A huge wall is a waste of taxpayers money! Repair the fences that already exist first. Add more border control, drones, cameras, etc..
I read all of the comments here and it makes me embarrassed to be a Republican... everyone is just name calling like our President. No wonder nothing gets done if this is the mentality of our party. I was hoping we would MAGA again but I am beginning to see that Trump is just a clown and a joke as are his supporters. I am embarrassed that I voted for this fool.  #TurningBlue
President Trump you know you can not make a jackass budge.
There's another Caravan coining 5,000 and behind that one there's another 7,000  when asked that they won't be allowed in the USA  just because they want a JOB THEIR ANSWER? WHOCARES.. NO RESPECT FOR AMERICA. DEPLOY 25,000 ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY CLOSE THE BORDER CUT TRADE. MEXICO IS HELPING THEM WITH BUSES.
The Angel Moms are not public enough, despite they are trying. Need much more penetration and saturation of their stories. Too many people still haven't heard or are ignoring their stories. In that same vein, where are the legal immigrants? Legal immigrants should be out in force, all over the media, decrying the unfairness and danger of illegals. Where are the Angel Moms? Where are the legal immigrants? Neither of these groups are vocal enough or visual enough to make the impact they need to make.
Build the wall
We’re with you! Government employees can draw on their 401ks tax free during a shutdown and pay it back out of their back pay. Also they should plan for these shutdowns and have at least a 6 month nest egg saved. Keep it shut until immigration is FIXED! #CONGRESSDOYOURJOBS!
‘Twas during the shutdown ….And the speaker of the house,  Tried to leave town ….quiet as a mouse.  Pelosi was packed … She was ready to go.  But Trump sent a letter,” I don't think so ...”  “You can't use my plane,” he said with Glee, “ You must stay here and negotiate with me !” She said “What nerve.  What gall!” Trump said: “Tough sh%@#! I'm getting my wall!!!”
Why does Nancy and Chuck hate you so much to deny America its security?  When they approve the taking care of Illegals in the amount of what?  $138 Billion PER YEAR.  When All they have to do is do what AMERICA wants, that is build the wall, or should I say FINISH the wall for a one time price of $5 billion.  So why do nancy and chuck HATE America so much?
This must suck for all of you liberal and Democrats out there today. Donald J. Trump, perhaps one of the greatest Presidents to not get any respect from the still butt hurt aforementioned because their 'queen' lost an unlosable election, is 1/2 way through his FIRST term. If you snowflakes would just get out of the way - like you told us to do when Barak Obama was President - we could fix some of the stuff that man screwed up. But no, the 'Party of Tolerance' will keep being intolerable. Nice to know you never practice what you preach, flip flop more than a beach sandal and hold a grudge like Bill Clinton does with interns.
Thank God we have President who puts America and Americans first 🙏🏼 he puts his country and the feelings of these families first, while the Lunatic left continues to campaign for criminals, illegals and open borders. What the Hell People! How can you Not love this President?🇺🇸

Nice to know you never practice what you preach, flip flop more than a beach sandal and hold a grudge like Bill Clinton does with interns.
Gary Blunt Sr. Herp the derp
He may be in a pickle?  face impeachment, or resign and face conviction! ??
Lj Ide, he'll fact indictment and conviction regardless of whether he's impeached or resigns.

It's horrible what has happened  to these families but more Americans  have killed fellow Americans the illegal immigrants have.
More of Trump ‘s Lies. The Only Emergency is the Trump’s Government Shutdown! Trump’s Border Wall is Another Trump Scam! This “Monument of Trump’s Stupidity “will not prevent people from climbing over it, tunneling under it or going around it. To pay for it, Trump and the republikkkans will eliminate Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid!! Only the Brain Dead believe the Lies that this Scumbag is Spewing!! Let That Sink In !!!
BUILD THE WALL  !!
She's a fucking power hungry ass backward drunkard wetbrain
God bless these fallen heroes and their families, thank you from all Americans!!! This is a Manufactured, obstruction of the TRUMP presidency, this is tyranny, against us and our elected POTUS. Because if these people can not control America, nobody can!!! All these disgusting, sick, power hungry, democrats, republicans, the deep state, the liberals, the socialists, the globalists, the millionaires in Silicon Valley, ruining Cali for all others then, themselves, along with Pelosi and Maxine Waters, and making it the left cabal state, this example of the Cali state is the microcosm of what they want for all Americans, socialist control of the people's, SAD, MAGA, WE THE PEOPLE FOR TRUMP!!! WAKE UP AMERICA!!!

Mr President,  You’ve done an amazing job . But many things still need to be imploded. CAIR must be removed from these shores. They do not have any desire to coexist. Lastly, we must demand they either assimilate or leave. This religion is not one of peace. It is political ideology using a religion to slowly conquer a town, a state, a nation, the world. This is beyond debate.   Education in this country is a straight “build a Marxist sheep” program at every grade level. This is by far is your most important task and perhaps longest  lasting move to ensure the radical leftist globalist never drive the country into the toilet again.   I do trust the plan. I know that where we go one we go all. However, I do believe that many American loving  patriots will totally lose faith in you and our nation if the criminals are not brought to justice in a public and big way. How are we going to prevent American Politicians of the future from becoming Clinton/Obama criminals who hate and destroy America. We must have a visual Nuremberg - A watershed moment where traitors, child killers, and their ilk meet MAGA justice.  Deep state justice is a massive part of the MAGA patriot’s expectation.  Furthermore , pedophiles and child killers should be dealt with as prescribed by the Bible. A rope, a millstone, and a body of water. Those that would harm a child deserve the darkest justice our nation can offer.  You are a master level troll. I suggest you take it up a notch. Education debt is killing this country’s college graduates. Can you imagine how a college graduate’s life might change if they were informed that their eighty thousand debt was reduced to zero? Imagine what that might do for our economy.  But there’s a catch. They must donate two thousand dollars to the building and or maintainance of our southern border wall. If a person is unable to pay that amount then they can pay monthly for five months. Finally, every person who donates to the wall gets 5”x5” sign with their name. They also rescieve a photo of their sign on the wall and its precise mile location.  Many thanks and may God continue to bless and protect you.  Sincerely,  The Garners

It is sad when the president must fight for the rights of citizens over the rights of those who want to invade our country illegally!  Meanwhile the Democrats are more concerned with rights of illegals!  As a voting citizen, I expect my representatives to protect us and maintain law and order in our country.  The path to freedom was given to us by men and women who fought for us.  Those who want to come here need to come LEGALLY!

They have completely unhinged and gone rats ass crazy. The more they yell and scream about pro socialistic, pro  communists , anti rich ( even though Obama, Clintons, Pelosi and others have made a fortune being politicians )  Anti-White , Christian or Jews makes them more popular. Actually anything Un America is very popular with them . Most of all redistribution of wealth and more freebies and entitlements. It would be ideal  for them to take all the money from anyone who has anything and give it to the illegals and those that can never find a job. Fu*k the hard working well to do people that struggled to make it .  Open borders , free medical and education to illegals , while Americans have to work hard for a living and pay taxes. Almost all illegals work off the books and pay no taxes thereby get food stamps and many other benefits. Give it to the lazy ass useless and the illegals. Where are these people from? What’s more is that this sells air time and makes money for the fake news .

Democrats. I’m tired of you telling me and the country lies about that the wall will not work. You say people will just dig under it. Well I say, the amount of people digging tunnels under the wall is going to be so minuscule to the amount of people it deters in the first place. Also the new wall I’m sure will be going down in the ground deep enough to discourage tunnels. It will also discourage people from making that very dangerous trip to our border. I’m tired of hearing about technology yet nobody says what kind of technology that you’re proposing. Is your technology going to stop them from stepping one foot on US soil, because if it doesn’t then we will be chasing them down and then they will be getting all the benefits & rights this country has to offer. It will also be adding to the all ready back log of 900,000 immigration court cases that are already pending. So if your technology it’s not stopping them from coming across the border in the first place then it’s just bullshittttt. Walls work, and walls are in 40 some plus countries used for protecting their borders. They are around prisons, the Vatican, the Facebook man and all the rich peoples houses.  Why do Democratic politicians have walls around their house ???  So I’m sick and tired of hearing you say walls don’t work. That’s bullshitttt, and all you liberals know is your Democratic talking points and they don’t make commonsense. Only a few years ago the Democrats voted for a wall, and there are plenty of videos to prove it.  It is only now they don’t want it because Trump campaigned on it, and it would be seen as a win for him, and Democrats can’t have that even though it makes our country safer. Democrats know that would hurt their re-election possibilities. Democrats only care about the votes that illegals can bring them. Ask yourself this question, if illegals voted for Republicans instead of Free Stuff Democrats, would that wall already been built by Democrats by now !!!!  😂😂😂. Democrats would love to take away our Second amendment constitutional right of bearing arms if it could only save just one life yet they turn a blind eye to the thousands and thousands of people that have died because of a unsecured border. Can you say hypocrites !! The truth is Democrats learned over the last decade that they gained 3 million new voters if they allow illegals to jump the border. Lets not be stupid here. At some point Democrats have to see the elephant in the room.!!!  Ps. They do see that elephant but they are telling us there is no elephant and yet people believe it because they have the News Media on their side. You might ask why then is the News Media on the Democrats side??  Easy, because the Media are 90% liberal. Open your eyes to what lies you are being told. By only watching one source of news you are self censoring yourself. Out of all the news going on in this world you only here 24/7 negative news on Trump. It is impossible for anyone to do that much wrong in a booming economy. The liberal media is taking us for suckers.  How much good could we be doing for our country if Democrats were on the side of the American people and working with Trump. We are all on the same team. We are not supposed to be two separate football teams fighting each other.  We should be like ONE Football team that has a offense and defense trying to win the game together. I can’t believe how half this country can’t see this.  Jack Schoch. Yes, I wrote this and I approve my message. I’m sick of this Crap.

Instead of building a wall...Use the money to make those countries civilized instead of acting like barbaric assholes!  I don’t get it. Enlighten me please.
Amy Hays I Agree with you.  I was being sarcastic when I said let’s give them money instead of a wall. I’m tired of everyone blaming Trump. It’s their government they should fix their side of the road. These countries should be up to par with the U.S. by now.  Right?

Do some research on your own and see how much has been donated to those countries over the last 20 years...that hasnt changed anything..only thing that would do anything is to go in by force and remove their goverment in a all out war...until people in those countries stand up to their own goverment nothing will change.. 80% of the worlds population according to the UN lives on less than 10 dollars a day...is it sad yes but we cant support the whole world

You are the devil
Here's an idea dumb dumb, crack down hard on those who employ undocumented immigrants, shut them down and send them to jail. Once the word gets out no one here will hire them they will stop coming and the 100's of thousands that fail to honor their visa commitments will leave. But then we will have to convince all your trumpkins to go to work

Nancy Pelosi will not meet with the Angel families that lost loved ones because of illegal immigrants because they do not fall into her delusional and misguided political agenda. It just shows how screwed up her and the democratic party are. They support illegals more than they support the American people. It is pretty pathetic.
I don't believe Nancy Pelosi should even eat in office. She has proven that she is 100% Democrat doesn't care about our country and who voted her in or total idiots. Can't wait till vote again get rid of Nancy Pelosi
THERE WILL BE MANY AMERICAN CRIMINALS...FORGET ABOUT THE MEXICANS...THIS WILL CREATE AMERICAN CRIMINALS...ALL YOU MUST BE RICH.....I VOTED FOR TRUMP REGRETFULLY.....THE POOR ARE COMING TO YOU....HOPE YOU RICH CATS ARE READY....

Build the wall..

Pelosi is one sorry ass individual.  She cares about no one in this country.  Pelosi is against a wall but the first thing you notice at her house is a wall with a gate.  Trump actually cares for the American citizens, unlike that useless whore.
.... attention Trump haters!!!... if you're following Trump on Facebook, you're fucking idiots..
We support Mr president Honest man those alions are danger to country.jumping wall throwing stones.it Democrates responsible for shut down.i ws with them to vote .now not on this agenda These people are coming without guns they buy here usa can never be taken over in any way.
Getting more and more angry with this Party.  Where were you these last two years when you had ZERO RESISTENCE in building a wall, or reforming immigration you dick head.   You wait until you've got Pelosi and Schumer to blame for a wall you know you'll never actually build.  It's just too damn easy to whip up your base by dangling these bullshit posts and campaign speeches in front of them.   Put your money where your mouth is, because my Party sure the hell hasn't these last 2 years. Repeal and Replace!   Benghazi!  Fast and Furious!  Loretta Lynch on the tarmack!  Build the Wall!   Please.  All of the sudden, no one finds most of those important anymore, but they were ALL anyone could talk about when there was a Democrat to run against.  Hillary is gone, and so is all the talk about her crimes.   Put up or shut up Mr. President.  Same to this do-nothing GOP party I've spent the last 10 years fighting for/arguing/defending.

No wall you dumb idiot
To all you libtard Dem morons out there — THE WALL = WINNING.  Got it? 🤪
I never saw so much hate in my life for a President , that shows what the Democrats are! Vile ,liars , low ! so many families lost the loved ones ... committed by  Illegals,  and more millions more   want  to invade  to  our Country ,it is outrageous !
you need to SHUT DOWN your social media and go back to NY.
What kind of evil cold blooded politicians can not feel the pain of so many moms and dads who have had children murdered by illegal immigrants. The kind of politician that I would not want representing me. Pelosi and Schummer could care less about anyone other than themselves they are both to vile to serve American citizens. People from California and New York should be very proud of Nancy and Chuck no one else is.
we want Pelosi to leave and take her useless democrats with her
Hey here's an idea to pay for your damn border wall. How about you decriminalize marijuana and use the profits to fund the building. Instead of fucking over the American people with this shutdown
The fact she refuses to meet with those families speaks volumes! She’s already disregarded, and disrespected one mother to her face! 😡 Nancy is an insane, hateful, vindictive fool who is seriously overcome with TDS!

Nancy is a Fk Bitch send her ass to Mexico for ever
The Dems have rejected your very generous offer. They now own this shutdown. Close the border indefinitely, including legal ports of entry.  Declare a National Emergency. It is not fair that illegals are jumping ahead of legal applicants to get into the U.S. , where they will be released. American taxpayers are tired of supporting illegals. Government-dependent illegals and refugees are going to collapse the economy of this country. That is the goal of Democrat Socialists and Globalists who are trying to implement NWO.
We need illegals deported just as, if not more so than the wall.
I want Pelosi on a stick. We don't always get what we want. That is a lesson that is hard for people to gbrasp. They have been coddled so much, even allowing men in dresses to pee with our children in public restrooms. Finally, a strong man who doesnt bend when folks don't like him. He doesn't care! He is not president to bend, break or hold you when you whine. He is more likely to whoop your ads and invite you to get up or get out. Its hard to be told no I guess. People has lost their moral compass. Pesident Trump is about leading with a firm hand.

What a moron!
Wake up people it is Nancy and Chuck that are holding the Americans hostage Trump has tried and tried and all the can say no they want all the Illegals here because they know America is getting sick of what the Democrats are doing we want Our Country back We need the Wall
Tired of all this Collusion questions.  President Trump said himself  "I have never been more insulted by any question or statement "   well I really have to disagree I think Stormy Daniels said worse " He has a mushroom for a dick"  so it's toss up.  I don't understand why they make a big deal that DJT has met with Putin 5 times already and many times in private again I am less concerned with Collusion than I am of Penetration !!!  Putin has to be the pitching and Trump the catcher !!   Firm believer for a wall as it will get people working and there should be no interference from immigrants as they just entered Arizona via a Tunnel found too late.  I know the President is doing his best to end the Shut Down but Melania won't budge as she got on a military plane to Mar Lago  good for her.  Let's hang in there and continue to support the President, for me getting together with neighbors today to go down the Coast Guard Food Pantry setup so these kids and families can eat and save what they have saved for rent  elec etc.   After all these are the people that save lives at sea and confiscate most of the drugs trying to get into USA.  The same people who actually MAKE AMERICA GREAT.   MAGA !
Keep sucking trump Fox News
TRUMP IS, "INDIVIDUAL 1" and implicated in 2 felonies in court documents. BEWARE the Trump Low life cheesy lying UnAMERICAN crime family.  MORE MANAFORT INFORMATION WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL. Michael Cohan has set date to testify in congress in open session. 😂 Grab your popcorn, Walnuts 😂  Trump has been being investigated since before inauguration by the counterintelligence division of the FBI (ongoing).  Allen Weisselberg and David Pecker have given up all they know including videotapes and documents about all his filthy dirty dealings.
You're likely going to need to call a State of Emergency to get the wall funding, Mr. Trump. These Democrats are nothing but obstructionists and subversives, who care not one iota about America or the American People. They care about getting back in power, period, and they see a huge influx of illegals in here as undocumented future Democrat voters. They scream about Voter IDs, borders, they want sanctuary cities around the country - their agenda is obvious. #BuildTheWall
President TRUM P you have the power to put these Hypocrites Wicked Devil Worshipping Witches & Warlocks in Prison for multitude of murders, kidnapping & selling children & adults into slavery.... Why aren’t they Arrested & Locked up? A dog can pee on the side walk but if I did they’d lock me up & these people get away with murder, rape, & crimes so unspeakable they defy ones imagination. I speak to you devils in Jesus name you will not succeed in your plots & plans! You will fail & fall into the holes you dig for others! AMEN. PUT them in PRISON where they belong where they cannot do any more harm to PEOPLE! 🧐
What does that have to do with hurting 800,000 of your own employees. Stop this insanity. What a moron.
Don the Con is the worst president ever. Not even a POTUS, just a little, impotent, POS!
Open the government back up you dick biter
You cynically exploit the "Angel" families, despite the reality that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than citizens, and now cynically offer your "compromise". You created the DACA and TPS crises, and now try to exploit those whose suffering you caused with your hypocritical "compromise" to reopen the government. You closed the government and must reopen it now! You use and abuse the 800,000 government employees whose lives you are destroying! Each day your self-serving evil becomes more apparent to the American people!
What a moron!
What are you going to do about the illegals using their ITEN numbers and filing tax returns, using their children back in Mexico as deductions!!!! It's costing billions of dollars of Americans tax money for their illegal refunds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Democrats hate so much President Trump that they do not see how stupid they look and sound when using the same words like they have been given order what to say...this is a communist tactic .Adults that claim that are educated but do not understand that border security  is a complicated issue ...but before everything  else you have to have a barrier to establish where will be a port of entry. Democrats want open border and like illegals and ignore American citizens...They want to open the government and than discuss border security....are they serious about it ?????. They had 4 weeks to discuss ....did they ???....With this being said we the people have to support our president.....
A wall won’t work AND it will take at least 15 years to build and no less than $25 BILLION.  Prevention by fining those that house and hire illegals (your resorts might be fined though). No birthright for babies of non citizens. Rescind financial aid to these countries that continue to allow this. Why send our money there if they are just going to send their folks here? Why are we being held hostage for a wall instead of the talks happening with leaders of Mexico, Guatemala, or wherever these folks come from? WE should not have to deal with this due to greedy employers, American drug users, and egos from Washington!
Actually he made a couple of promises  Hes having problems with the wall An the deep state an left's are keeping him so busy putting out fires that he has forgot the one promise he made he can do  Make everything declassified on all of the  Deep state and the dems  He may not win the next election but he will go down in history as the man who really cleaned up Washington  An that includes the dems sending  That's wat he should go for Forget the cat an mouse games  They want that  Go big or go home mate  Clean up Washington an you will go down in history forever You dont need to do 2 terms  Try telling the people  That u may not be able to give them all you promised because of the obstructionist but you can get rid of the swamp  Do it  Do it now
We need to re-brand Mr. Fibb's slogan of "Make America Great Again" into "Hugs from Thugs"... Admittedly,he will sell out the will of the majority of country for $5.7B....take hostage a whole level of or workforce and not even mention them, create crisis and then take credit for fixing the crisis, and he will sell us out abroad... All it takes is an admiration letter or say you admire him. Aren't you glad you don't live in a dictator country where they can make you disappear, execute you, or starve you to death, deny you your legal rights??? America help feed those that are unpaid, unable to go to work population and thrive.. don't let the hostages suffer..give all you can, if you can..
Build the wall. Deport them ALL, with a democrat under each arm.
Came in to be a nude model. Then you brought her parents in. Tell me trumpy 🐷, what makes them better then the poor people trying to get to the U.S..  You are disgusting. 😉
How many decades have we not had a wall .. why now d idiots this is a country with many races  .. what's a wall ha going to do ..dumb a'ses. .

🎼Don't back down🎶 🎧Stand your ground🎶 We pay taxes for protection and we demand and deserve it. ✅Thank's a lot Democrats,Hollywood and bias media.✅I'm sure everyone knows some one who over dosed on fentanyl lace heroine.It's killing Americans and 90 % of it comes over the southern border and so does 75% of the heroine. Think about that every time you stick up for the Democrats.Build the wall or let more kids die,plain and simple.
Just shoot a few dozen and we wont need a wall
President Trump 20172025 I believe  most Americans  wish you  will suggest that the Despicable democrats fire bitch pelosi and  put a speaker in  who will put  Americans first,  We also want a balanced budget clause and  the elimination of the  discretionary spending clause,  no more cr' s  we also want  a smaller government and  cuts in spending, in order to reduce the Despicable debt dramatically so America's children and grandchildren  are not slaves to the debt , Tomorrow  hopefully will begin the firing of government employees:  ( the worthless incompetent government  employees)  We all are grateful and thank God you are President : 2 years since you took the oath of office.  Yay,  ;)  Thank You God's speed and God bless America and your family
President Trump knew they would reject his proposal....he is showing the Latinos ...(he was already up 19 poll points by Latinos before the speech) that the Dems aren’t there for them. Like he is showing Black American they have been fooled by the Dems for decades. Just give him a chance. He knew that he was going to use the military all along to build the wall. This is all to expose the Dems corruption. He had to wait for 30 day shutdown to get rid of deep state DEMS WORKING in the Government that he couldn’t fire. Now under RIF he can. I bet he brings back only half of the 800,000 that have been laid off. And Obama brought Muslim Brotherhood into the Government that Trump couldn’t get rid of. Just trust Trump he is smarter than you think. He is exposing the Dems and the Media to the American people about how corrupt they are. Just relax it will turn out ok. Just take a breath.
You're stupid and donkey.
Immigrants, including illegal immigrants, commit fewer crimes than other Americans. We statistically have LESS to worry about when it comes to illegals.
This has been with Clinton, Bush, & Obama  & Shame on Paul Ryan for not getting this done.. Why can't it go back to the bill passed by Republicans before dems came in?  Pelosi think she's running everything..She needs to get off her HIGH HORSE... & fixed this. They are blaming President Trump, but they have never done anything...STOP illegals coming into OUR country... A 1 page immigrant Law would help with this.   & STOP giving our money FREE to them.  All of you is working for the PEOPLE & we need to STOP your PAY...!!!!!!!   🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  I want MY TAXES to go towards the WALL or Barrier....
What about all the people murdered everyday by our own citizens... mass shootings... their lives were also stolen by oor own citizens ...they matter just as much as these Angel families... these people aren’t anymore special than others that have been murdered...

Donald Trump is guilty of treason.
We do want save boarders, but spending g money on a wall will not keep the terrorists out. In case no one has mentioned it, we welcome legal migration here in the US. Fix the system. Hire more people. People will come here legally if the system is safe, efficient, and effective. We need workers!
I dont thank God for him but rather pray that God would get this turd ball out of office as this country was and will always be known as the melting pot country and Donald Duck Trump sure knows how to perfect the temper tantrum and truely is making a mockery of our country's political system . It's bad enough he threw a temper tantrum when the vice president took his bouncy ball away from him I could just imagine what's gonna happen when he gets his official eviction notice from the white house. And I also pray the courts take his properties away from him as he needs no power to return as he is trying to create a situation that will bring about martial law and put all of these wal mart stores that have been converted to holding centers into active status and this God for saken wall that he is pushing to build is gonna do one thing and that's lock us in and imprison us supposedly free Americans that are working so hard for him to take our tax money and play a brain game with it just the same as he did with his fake bankruptcy filing to get 2 trump towers in New York City. So please people look at the TRUE facts not fiction before you go supporting a liar , a cheater , and a thief.
United States does not negotiate with terrorism.  Donald Trump is a terrorist holding this country hostage for f $5.7 billion.  Don’t give in to this motherfuckers demands.
Donald J. Trump, you lying bullying con artist traitor+MF! You can fool your stupid sheep but not me.  Now, go seek asylum in Russia and get the f*ck out of our country.

Mexico and the United States share a border over 1800 miles long… But their standards of living are not the same: the United States is the richest country in the world whereas half the population of Mexico is poor. 12 million Mexicans have chosen to live in America, of which 6 million are illegal immigrants. These immigrants cross the border, often risking their lives, in the hope of a better life. In fact, the American Mexican border has become one of the busiest passages for illegal immigrants in the world.  The American president Donald Trump, got elected by promising to make the United States great again. He believes a strong country is a country with closed, well guarded borders!  According to Trump, Mexicans take American jobs. And even threaten their security. He therefore promised to protect the United States by building a 1000 mile long wall along the border. But this wall raises many problems, starting with the cost: several billion dollars! Mexico feels angry and humiliated, especially as Trump wants to make Mexico pay. Opponents of the American president denounce the wall as being contrary to American values; what made it strong. A haven of refuge for migrants from everywhere.  Yes Mr. President please build that wall  Stop the illegals drugs. Stop the illegals human trafficking. Stop the illegals Aliens. Stop the killing of our Americans citizens.  Donald John Trump 2020 Then... we need a woman  President for 2024 Ivana Marie "Ivanka" Trump(?) Or Nikki Haley. Nimrata "Nikki" Haley(?)  Time to have a great woman as President of United States for 2024
A joke to president allows N.Korea to have more warheads than ever before. A gangster to president ignores US people as long he and the family earns money through shady Russian business. The bragging president allows himself to say depressing comments about others and brag about pussy grabbing . A boastful president pays $ 130000 to silence Stormy Daniels. Christian rhetoric in the US is in total chaos . Cheating, pussy grabbing, money laundering president now leading the world's biggest real democracy / country in total chaos and conflicts. Russia, China, N.Korea, Saudi, Syria, EU, wall, what a con

Trump takes DACA kids hostage about his foolish wall. Americans not getting paid those that protect us TSA and coast guard  while he has a tantrum, why hurt Americans over a wall he said Mexico is paying
She won’t listen, she is brain dead
This is an open and public letter to the duly elected president Donald J Trump, from William Sharpe, citizen of the United States of America.  Dear Mr. Pres. you are in a very unique position as president of the United States, whereas only three other presidents have been placed into this position throughout the history of our nation, James Madison, Abraham Lincoln, and John F. Kennedy, two of the three were assassinated as you well know.  James Madison was fighting for the survival of our nation during the war of 1812, Abraham Lincoln was fighting for the survival of our nation, through the Civil war of 1860,  and John F. Kennedy was assassinated before he could fight and save America from the same foes, that the formal two presidents and yourself know so well.  Mr. Pres. you are in a unique position to be in a minority of great presidents and great leaders, and your challenges are no less than the challenges that these president faced, and probably because of technology today your challenges may be greater.  Mr. Pres. we are at the pinnacle as a nation for survival, I don't think anyone needs to tell you this, but I will tell you that a majority of the American people stand behind you,, and are willing to sacrifice all to defend this nation from the tyranny coming from the Democratic party.  Mr. Pres. if we do not stop them here and now, we the American people will be forced into a unCivil War, and that is what these individuals want.  I would ask you to use the power granted to you by the office, to take these individuals involved in the destruction of our nation's Constitution laws our heritage our liberties and freedoms, into custody for trial as domestic terrorist, plotting the overthrow and destruction of the United States of America.  If we the people, common men like myself understand these things to be true and factual, we cannot wait any longer for our nation to be eroded away to be the equal of some substandard nation of crime and larceny.  The American people did not sacrifice their lives in all the battles and wars to defend this Republic to let it be taken away by pedophile, serial killers, rapist.and murderers, and we the people are ready and willing to stand with you and fellow countrymen to stop the destruction of our nation!  If we take these individuals in for trial now, we will have stopped the next violent Civil War in America!  Their public statements and actions prove without a shadow of a doubt that they stand against the American people, and have larceny and ill will in their heart for the will and safety of the American people.  Sincerely citizen William Sharpe of Delaware.
build the wall most important i even saw iris kids say brexit they like it.  your father in law is for the people he will get re elected stay with the base. that is why like him he knows what democracy is  look after your own people first you cannot look after the world.  yes angel families must speak more for their family sake. i heard cher and her son where letting refugees come live with her hiding them closets when ice came in. now my husband said cher on his side. movie stars should not be speaking out against trump makes us people dislike them like carrie underwood. like madonna saying she wanted to kill trump  that is awful thing to do or say . your father in law is good man needs protection
You’re an idiot
Whitetrash tv for idiot
Michael Petruzzi - your point being?????   You don't hear of women, gays or transgenders committing mass shootings do you??

You are the swamp. Give it up, Fatty. The majority of America is against you and your cronies.
Pamela Nova Wolf You are in denial 😝.
sad democrats would rather destroy our country rather than have President Trump help U.S.A Citizens.  Amazing the praise muslim hussein received while taking our rights away.  Now we pay two cops 24/7 to block muslim hussein's street at both ends, even though he has built a wall around his house.  Didn't he tell you that?, while he condemns our President, for wanting to protect us.  Anyone that does not want the wall, please remove all locks and fences and walls from YOU house..  Open boarder Open your home.   idiots.
I do not agree with one party or another 100%. No one should. Sadly, people just align with one side or the other despite any logic or critical thinking concerning all of the issues we face. Face the Nation and other credible shows can help broadcast what makes sense for the USA. I did not catch her name but a politician stated today that if we all invested a percentage of our income in health care coverage like we do with SS, we could help solve the health care issue. I totally agree with this and have stated it myself. The key issue is that all or MOST people need to be investing in it. The amount of people getting free health care for them and their ever growing families while on welfare, have increased health care costs. In addition, the amount if people getting SSI for themselves and for their kids (for just about any reason under the sun) is robbing hard working individuals of their financial futures. Why is this allowed? Why do so many welfare recipients continue to have baby after baby while on welfare, getting free everything, raises, free food, health care, housing then get SSI checks for their kids? This lack of requirement for so many to NOT be productive citizens is atrocious. Require people to contribute! And making sure all get health care for a fair percentage of their income is a logical idea as long as all able bodied people contribute! We can not allow open borders until welfare and SSI are revised!
Contact Senator Kaine....Phone: (202) 224-4024 Senator Kaine, I heard you speak on the floor (1/18/19) how you empathize with the Government employees who are not receiving their paychecks. How a woman with a small baby was in tears as she missed her baby because her mother in another state had to baby sit her baby since she couldn't pay for day care while not receiving her govt pay. How moving it was to hear that mother's pain. Yet, what is more moving is the pain that Americans have been forced to feel every moment of every day because an Illegal has killed their loved one. So many American mothers miss their children whom they will NEVER see again because they were murdered by an illegal. The pain that Millions of Americans experience because an illegal has maimed them, raped them, attacked, harassed, stolen their ID, their property, their quality of life. I believe the pain of these Americans, at the hands of illegals, far exceeds the temporary "pain" expressed by those who aren't getting a paycheck as our President fights for ALL Americans by securing our border. Our President fights for ALL Americans, while you continue to fight for illegals and only a few Americans during this shut down. Fund the wall, build the wall, and fight for U.S ALL!  Respectfully,  Ms dawncee
Donald, shove your wall up your arse!  Glenn
How about the AMERICANS you put out of work! You want them to do a job for FREE! If it was me I'd walk in and be like your a fucking joke and a pos. You'd take it like the bitch you are
Americans now issue new compromise proposal.  Screw the Democrats.  No Amnesty.  Have the Military START BUILDING THE WALL, but do not announce it.  We don't give a damn about what the Democrat criminals say.  Build a WALL, not steel slats.  Keep the government shut!  Do not let the pressure off of the Democrat criminals. Start deporting the 11 million ILLEGAL ALIENS brought in through no fault of the American people.  And by the way, its more like 35 million, not 11 million.  This is our final offer.  The next step is to put Chuck and Nancy in prison in Guantanimo.
The fact that some undocumented immigrants have committed violent crimes is no justification for demonizing all undocumented immigrants, anymore than the fact that some American citizens commit violent crimes is justification for demonizing all Americans.  Besides, your simpleminded solution of a wall won't eliminate the bulk of undocumented immigrants.  https://www.npr.org/2019/01/16/686056668/for-seventh-consecutive-year-visa-overstays-exceeded-illegal-border-crossings
It is so disgusting and embarrassing that the USA has a PROPAGANDA STATION! Who pays for this PROPAGANDA STATION? Who pays the daughter in law's salary?
Safe borders is only the first step then deport All illegals , maybe appoint all those non essential government employyees to ICE and pay them based on the number of illegals they round up for deportation.
Pamela Nova Wolf You are in denial 😝.
I WOULDNT TO TO EVIL AND NANCY IS THE MOST EVIL PERSON I KNOW. GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF HER DUMBASS SATANIC WAYS.
You wont stop fighting?   With dodging Vietnam 5 times, you never STARTED fighting for this country in the first place you fucking coward!
How about parents of the children killed at Parkland? Or any of the other mass shootings?   Illegal immigration is at an all time low. Mass school shootings at an all time high. Kids have to grow up practicing active shooter drills. Any Republican that pretends that the wall is for the safety of kids, but in the same time does nothing for the safety of children gunned down in mass shootings is nothing more but a hypocrite.
Then stop talking about it and just Do it! Declare the Emergency, put up the wall and increase border safety and shove it up Nancy's senile nose....
You are ignoring those killed by home grown white supremacy who killed more Americans than any other group.  Only 1% of crime is committed by illegal Immigrants.  Manipulating the statistics is evil and wrong.
Mr. President:  The demand by Democrats that you re-open the government BEFORE negotiations begin on securing the border is a TRAP!  Don't trust them, Sir.  You MUST get funding for the wall before re-opening.  The monkey is on their back, now.
The FINGER POINTER! ...As Usual, playing the "Blame-Game" on others for YOUR OWN Nasty & Vile actions! ...STARVING America & Holding Us HOSTAGE For YOUR OWN Dark Purposes Is NOT Okay! #LockHimUp #ImpeachTrump #NotMyPresident
for the germans, i am the subhuman. destroy the honorless traitors. fight and win!

Is your wife also a criminal and a drug addict, just like anybody you mention now, maybe she is since she is married to someone like you
Kim Nielsen STFU and learn English you window licking idiot!!
Andrew Behrens Typically the only answer you have, throwing in the head of people you are an empty brain, like your president

Please stop listening to anyone but God and yourself!  Hold the line!!  I know they are hammering you but they always have.  Democcults want our nation overrun with criminals and drugs.  Start looking for the money and bank accounts they keep it in for selling our nation and our citizens out and then return it to the American Taxpayers they stole it from!
Do you know how many AMERICAN BORN KILLERS ARE SITTING ON DEATH ROW EATING THREE MEALS A DAY GETTING MEDICAL ATTENTION.  You will not save this country with a wall period.  DONALD TRUMP "FOLLOWERS" OPEN YOUR EYES AND WIPE YOUR OWN ASS AND THINK FOR YOURSELF AND YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY AMERICANS ARE, ARE CURRENTLY, SUFFERING NOW OVER A WALL. THE HUMAN TRAFFIC SCANDAL IN ARIZONA ALLLLLLLLL AMERICAN BORN POLITICIANS!!! CRIMINALS COME IN ALL NATIONALITIES AND THE BIGGEST CRIMINAL OF ALL IS IN CHARGE OF THIS COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T CARE WHO HE STEPS ONNNNN!! NOT OVER ON!! This is a political statement.  This wall is the most ridiculous thing ever.  "Followers" who can't wipe their own ass and who are waiting on Donald Trump to tell them when to jump and how high voted for this terrorist because they can't think for themselves.  DONALD TRUMP is a TERRORIST: a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
You are a liar and a fascist. We don't want your wall for a fictional crisis, we don't even want you as president.
You need to fix the Irs problem as well! Immigrants getting thousands of dollars in returns for claiming children not even in the us is ridiculous!
Wall or no wall trump is crazy fool of hate
Make now the LAST STEP on your way to Suicide, Dumb TRUMP !! FU !!!
Mr President. You are right. We the people totally agree and support the wall must build to protect our country and borders and USA citizens. Build the wall like North Korea and South Korea divided by triple fans with guns post. No one can in and out. Drugs dealers see the guns post. They will think twice before get in USA borders. It’s working so well in Korea. End the asylum abuser. End the welfare fund to illegal migrants. End the illegal migrants can vote. Already In USA illegal immigrants can’t get green card because they break the law. Restore 2A right.
We see what's going on the Democrats have no intention of protecting the American people. They only protect the illegal aliens that vote for them.
Andrew Behrens Typically the only answer you have, throwing in the head of people you are an empty brain, like your president
We see what's going on the Democrats have no intention of protecting the American people. They only protect the illegal aliens that vote for them.
There is no doubt that Pelosi will reject the President's latest offer. That being the case I would:   Immediately proclaim a national crisis and get the military building barriers.  Secondly, I would let ICE loose. By that I would have them raid thousands of businesses and immediately deport any illegals found. As a nice measure I would give a 1 week notice that these raids are about to begin. Thirdly, along with deportation I would arrest either the hiring HR director, or if no one fits that description, arrest the front line supervision for hiring illegals.   Lastly, I would implement a 25% fee on ANY monies wired to Mexico and Central America.   If the President would implement a get tough program I would guess Pelosi would come begging to finally get this immigration issue solved once and for all. This crap needs to end.
John King yes! Let's start with Mar A Lago. There's a host of illegals working there.
Jason McElweenie Works for me!
Mr President. You are right. We the people totally agree and support the wall must build to protect our country and borders and USA citizens. Build the wall like North Korea and South Korea divided by triple fans with guns post. No one can in and out. Drugs dealers see the guns post. They will think twice before get in USA borders. It’s working so well in Korea. End the asylum abuser. End the welfare fund to illegal migrants. End the illegal migrants can vote. Already In USA illegal immigrants can’t get green card because they break the law. Restore 2A right.
Jason McElweenie Works for me!
Curtis Rudisail not sure whether you really don't know or you are trying to be a smart ellic. I will accept it as the first one. It is someone who has a family member, most often child killed by an illegal immigrant. Most of the time it is not the first time the illegal immigrant has committed crimes before besides being here illegally.
Keith Dorn , Thanks I had no idea what it meant. Again thanks

****Think about This!!**** When Trump was originally going to run for office people told him to bring up immigration reform.  They felt it would be a good campaign platform to run on.   But he kept forgetting it so they told him to use the words “Build a Wall” because it’ll help you remember immigration reform.  He liked it so much that he decided to start spewing those words at every rally he had and that became his campaign slogan.  Pretty sure he was never really intending to actually build a wall.  Oh Look a fucking unicorn, meaning a made up thing that turned into him suddenly building a wall!!      Ask your self this question.   If Trump and the Republicans had actually wanted to build a wall, why didn’t they do it while they were in full control of all three branches of our government??   Obviously they didn’t need the Democrats help to do it.   They did the supposed tax cuts which was not popular with the Democrats due to it giving tax breaks for the richest people,  if they could do that then why couldn’t they do that with the wall??   Oh wait that’s because it didn’t really matter to Trump, and the Republicans in office didn’t want the wall!!    The Republicans  in office all sat on their ass and did nothing about the wall!!!  Blame Trump and your party, They had full control of our government and they squandered their chance away to build it if they really wanted it!!    Trump own this shutdown he has caused  and he is doing damage to our people and country all for a lie he created!!
Build the wall and MAGA!!! Drain the swamp and lock them up!! Thank you, Mr. President!
Keep standing strong, get the wall built!!  Thank you.  The democrats r so desperate to stop it cuz they know they got nothing of real value to offer voters, and they can only keep themselves in power by buying illegals’ votes by giving them free stuff with taxpayers’ money
Trump should have a sit down with El Chappo. He would perhaps find it educational except Trump would likely “fall in love” with him as he did Kim Jong Il. It’s always the worst of the worst who impress Trump the most.
So why are you wasting time negotiating with the devil?  Get it done!  Your base didn’t elect you to meet the lunatic left halfway to hell!  They are going to bitch no matter what you do, so let’s quit waiting.  The wall needs done now and need to focus on healthcare reform, people paying way too much for crap policies!
Keith Dorn , Thanks I had no idea what it meant. Again thanks

When you finally declare an emergency!   Build the wall. We need to bury barbed wire fence and other damaging materials all under the ground near the wall to also keep the illegals from tunneling
So dumbass's late night tweet storm was a gem, literally threatened the safety of 11 million people if his tantrum goes unanswered. This is exactly how fascism starts. Enjoy your dictator and traitor in chief, and wait til youd next on his purge
The wall is a symbol of fighting against socialism ... don't let drunk pelosi & nasty shumer ruin our wonderful country ... Build The Wall!!!
Hoe can people call him  the greatest president  .with a month long shut down and all the other bull crap going on. ....
Build the damn wall already

We're telling you to restart the government...no one asked you to sacrifice American security just to get your way like a spoiled brat
Cynthia Forney  You cannot have border security without a strong physical barrier.  Do you remember 9/11?  We've gotten too complacent.  Do we need another terror attack to get you people to understand that?

Make DACA permanent(not 3 years) w/ work permits and a path to citizenship. Then I’ll be happy for them to give you $5.7B for the wall. Anything less and you’re back to being Dumbass Donny.

My neighbor was killed by a white male with an AK automatic weapon. In fact so many more have been killed with assault rifles that trump and the GOP are ignoring the REAL security crisis.
Automatic weapons such as the AK-47 have been illegal in this country since 1937 so there is no need for legislation to outlaw them.

Don’t give in Mr. President.  No $5.7 B, no deal.  This is 100% on the left.  Pelosi and Schumer are only the head of the snake.  Maxine and Schiff are the tail.  Everyone in the middle are still snakes.  Worthless Republicans aren’t much better.  The Swamp deepens.
SICKO LIAR
u r liar
Trump
Never. Lier
If he wants to stop all the drug trafficking and all these drugs that day busted all that money that they show that They confiscated why they do not use all of that money toward the wall a lot of money they show that they got from Chapo why don't they use that money as well we as American shouldn't have to deal with the price of building it
Such a very low, dirtball approach to getting what you want, Comrade Cry-baby! As always, you suck. Go directly to jail!
Look at the influx coming in and we can't find jobs for our children coming out of school. Too many pushing our system and they know they can get free money if allowed to stay. Then they send it back ,tax free to their country. Bank of America and Wal-Mart helps them do it too.

You made a promise to your sheep followers that you were going to build this big beautiful wall because you were the only one who knew about beautiful walls and MEXICO was going to pay for it.  Just goes to show your sheep that your a dumbass lying bastard.  And, they believed it.

Why don't you crack down on the American employers that employ illegal immigrants. If there are less jobs in America for illegal immigrants than they won't want to come here .    a wall is a stupid idea.
Most of the people that are bitching about the cost of border security don’t pay taxes anyway. They either don’t work, they get everything they paid back on their tax return, or they are just low life thieves who go around stealing from others.
Idiot
You are a liar
The entire left are full blown communist Anti American! As we are witnessing they place our enemies and all Illegals BEFORE AMERICA!

BLAME THE TRAITOR DEMOCRATS FOR FIRST FAVORING AND PROTECTING ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH A SANCTUARY STATE LAW. NOW ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CAN COMFORTABLY DO A CRIME. EASILY GET FREE KICK BACK TIME WITH FREE ROOM AND BOARD BED INCLUDED AND GET REWARDED WITH NOT BEING DEPORTED. WE LOVE YOU LAURA TRUMP ❤ SORRY FOR YOUR PRECIOUS LOST MARY ANN ALL ANGEL'S FAMILIES.
Democrats have become a socialist party. They no longer care about Americans. Democrats want power in order to stay in power they need illegals votes even tho they shouldn’t vote or get social security, or welfare they do.
Melania is trumps main bitch
It is interesting to me that there are 23 million Trump followers and only 4 thousand comments on this thread screaming for a wall and some how you think you are the majority or that this is what people want... it's not!  The majority of people recognize that 3 years of DACA in exchange for 5 billion for a wall (which is grossly underbudget to complete, estimates are upwards of 30+ billion BTW) makes about as much sense as pissing in the wind... they only reason he made this offer is because it is a meaningless gesture that he thinks he can use to paint democrats as not caring about Dreamers.... he is the one that unilaterally dismantled the program.  SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP MR PRESIDENT.  We aren't as stupid as you are.
That kid taunting the Native American with that MAGA hat is quickly becoming a steadfast symbol of hate in America. You can’t spell “hatred” without “red hat”
Illegals are killing 12 Americans daily and they are not stopping to ask are you Democrats, Republicans, conservative or liberals..This is why I don't understand why anyone would be against adding a strong wall to stop these killers
A million vehicles pass the border everyday raise the fee from 44 to 46 dollars the extra 2 dollars at around 700 million per year can pay for and maintain the wall..enough bullshit already that cunt wants to resist at all costs..Pelosi skeleton bitch

Our tax dollars go to fix infrastructure and walls in other countries, but not here in America.  Build the wall and fix our infrastructure.
And stop sending our tax dollars to other countries.  We need it here now.  The cost of housing has caused people to have to live on the streets.

shut the border down nothing crosses build the wall
You moron!
We have to many illegals in our country. Working low qualification/manual labor jobs citizens could be working. Theyre hired because theyll work for less. This depresses wages in the entire area if high pops of them reside there. They get any type aid the state/county offers the same way they fraudulently get jobs, using stolen identities. These programs were meant for citizens truly in need. Not illegals here adding it in to their income. This needs to stop.  #deportallillegals
I want Trump to shove the wall down all the Democrats throats just like Obama and the other evil San Fran Nan shoved Obamacare down ours!!!

Yes a wall....but better drug control. I’m ok with immigrants coming here legally, to work. (Not to bilk our system) The main reason should be drug control. Show these people a few episodes of Border Wars, they will get a clue as to how bad things really are.

Nancy is an enemy of the legal citizens who pay taxes.  I can’t imagine why any legal citizen would support her.  I can’t imagine why a political party could hold so much power over a legal citizen who pays taxes  to keep us safe and free.  Our political elected leaders are beholden to the people who made them very wealthy. That’s why they can’t retire.  They owe their donors for their wealth and the Wall surrounding The District of Columbia.  We are and have been fools folks.  We the People are the only ones that can change a corrupt system.  I can understand why young people are frustrated and embrace socialism. That’s the only way they can equalize the wealth in their view. In the long view Socialism fails them.  President Trump is one of the bravest men I’ve known in my lifetime.  He gave up everything to expose a corrupt system that was deeply embedded in our very own Government. We can win this game folks if we put Party Politics aside and support him.

Facebook must be dealt with severely. Facebook, cease to be a private organization when it became a monopoly, when it broke antitrust laws, and when it began from its Inception to promote a political leftist ideology, while discriminating against conservatives. Facebook has been a George Orwellian farm being used to program the minds of leftist people to their, FB's, Progressive agenda, Facebook's prevents should have an equal Level Playing ground for conservatives, as they are discriminate against daily.  Facebook has allowed its social media police 2 propagate and promote leftism oh, and radically Left ideologies. On the other hand, Facebook has discriminated against conservatives an often kick them off to silencer opinions, and intellectual voices. Facebook as any leftist fears the truth oh, and they don't want other people to hear the truth. Truth to the left and Facebook is like Kryptonite is to Superman
We don’t want a wall. Join the modern age. Walls are useless

Linda Sarsour is a Bad Omen for America. This person is a liar, an enemy of the United States and Israel! It will have to be EXPULTED. We are afraid for your safety.  Jan 19, 2019 8:00 am By Rami Dabbas - 30 Comments  Every day more secrets are revealed about the Muslim Brotherhood and the State of Qatar, which stands behind the Muslim Brotherhood and supports it financially and morally through several tools and institutions, both inside Arab countries and in the West, especially in the United States of America, under the cover of the charities and NGO organizations located in those countries.  Linda Sarsour is an Arab American of Palestinian origin and executive director of the New York-based Arab American Society, an association that is administratively linked to the Qatar Foundation International and ideologically follows the Muslim Brotherhood and Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi – a terror promoter — who strongly supports the terrorist Hamas movement and the Qatari government, which is allied with adherents of political Islam. The Qatar Foundation International is closely linked to the Qatari government. Former US Treasury Department analyst Jonathan Schanzer describes the institution as “an ATM for the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliated groups, the spiritual father of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, as well as funding Hamas and terror groups in Syria.” Schanzer stressed that Qatar’s neighbors from Arab countries were “nauseated” by Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Qatar Foundation and the Emir of Qatar established the Al-Qaradawi Research Center in honor of Qaradawi. The purpose of the Center was to promote Al-Qaradawi’s ideas on the basis that he was a pioneer of moderate Islamic thought for Muslims today. In January 2012, the Qatar Foundation (QF) opened a center for Islamic legislation and advocacy. Tariq Ramadan, the grandson of the Brotherhood’s founder Hassan al-Banna and the son of Brotherhood leader Saeed Ramadan, was appointed as the director of research of the center.  At the same time, the Qatar Foundation has strong ties to the International Institute of Islamic Thought, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States that was investigated on terror finance issues after the 9/11 attacks. The deputy director of the Qatar Foundation for Islamic Legislation and Advocacy was Jasser Odeh. At the same time, he taught and lectured at the International Institute of Islamic Thought, as he mentioned in his own profile. The Muslim Brotherhood in the United States described the International Institute of Islamic Thought as one of “our organizations and institutions owned by our friends” in a secret memo issued in 1991. The memo states that the purpose of its network in the United States is “a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destructing Western civilization from within.”  Now we come back to Linda Sarsour, who also has suspicious personal relationships. In 2004, Sarsour told the press that the US authorities questioned her and her Palestinian husband Maher Judeh, who was threatened with deportation after living in the United States for seven years. In the same interview, Sarsour mentioned that one of her cousins spent 25 years in prison in Israel, and that a family friend was sentenced to 99 years in prison. She added that her unmarried brother was also serving a 12-month sentence for being a member of Hamas.  The New York Police Department opened an investigation into the relationships of the Arab-American Association, headed by Linda Sarsour, and tried to obtain information about its board members. It found that its chairman was Dr. Ahmed Jaber, head of the Dawood mosque, known as the Islamic Mission in America. Sarsour is constantly trying to portray law enforcement officials and the government as unfair to Muslims, and her claims and fears of terrorist plots are in fact government conspiracies, according to Sarsour.  For example, Sarsour said that New York police detectives fabricated terror cases so they could get funding for the New York Police Department. The government stopped an al-Qaeda plot to destroy an aircraft using an explosive device hidden in a person’s underwear: Sarsour claimed the attacker was actually a CIA agent. In an interview, Sarsour said that “fear of Islam” is merely a manifestation of American persecution of minorities, and the United States remains a democratic state with an authoritarian element. Sarsour is known to launch fierce attacks on Muslim Brotherhood opponents, including Muslim dissidents themselves, so the Qatar-affiliated Brotherhood put its money in the right place when it decided to invest in her organization.
No wall, EVER. Why? Because you will not be in office for long. Trump's buffoon lawyer Guiliani... "I can tell you his counsel to Michael Cohen throughout that entire period was, 'Tell the truth.' We thought he was telling the truth. I still believe he may have been telling the truth when he testified before Congress," he told host Chuck Todd. Thought they believe Cohen to be nothing but a liar?? Getting awfully difficult to keep track of all their lies! 2019 quote of year - "Impeach the motherfucker"

Except you've turned down every safe border policy because it doesn't fund your ineffective wall.  Some your border security policies are great, but your wall will not stop significant amounts of drugs or illegals. Immigrants, and especially deportable immigrants, are our lowest violent crime and drug population.  I am with you, however, on making the lives of our border patrol agents easier. So are the democrats who have met every single one of your demands in compromise, even offering to give you some money for the wall.  I don't want to pay even a cent for it. You said "Mexico will pay for the wall". Keep that promise and you can have the colossal waste of resources you so desperately desire.  Meanwhile, reopen the government that you shut down Mr. President. Those families are actually suffering. They have actually had their job stolen. You said you would "proudly* do this. I am asking you, desperately, for families, for single men and women, for US children and elderly who depend on support networks to survive, for veterans, for those with significant medical conditions: please reopen the government. You are hurting these people. They are your people Mr. President.
1. Day 731 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency - Halfway Point) - Halfway Point! What has happened in 731 days? Well, Donald J Trump is LITERALLY an Unindicted Co-Conspirator. We learned that per Donald freaking NAZIS are "good people." Let us go through the list... Con Man Trump taking credit for an economy that was growing when he took office, unlike The Great Recession Obama assumed. ISIS was in effect defeated b/c Iraq Citizens decided to fight and die along with our Ally the Kurds. North Korea Kim Jon Un had NEVER met the President of China. Now, they are best pals and North Korea still has Nuclear Weapons (just not testing missiles). Iran Deal canceled pissing off EU, Britain, France, Germany, China, & Russia (Iran was complying). USA withdrew from TPP, though, the 11 other nations continued to negotiate and signed the trade deal (Has Trump negotiated any Trade Deals?). A new NAFTA was negotiated which changed percentages and called something else to look like Donald negotiated an incredible deal.  What else? Donald has LIED repeatedly about the Criminal Conspiracy with Russia but still denies any "collusion."  DEFICITS - The Uneducated White Trump Voter (REMEMBER The Tea Party) no longer cares about Deficits. During the Great Recession, Obama ran Trillion Dollar Deficits and these people screamed! The USA will begin running Trillion Dollar YEARLY Deficits this year and The Uneducated White Trump Voter will blame Pelosi and Democrats.  Tax Cuts - The top 1% received a Tax Cut along with Corporations who were making record profits. ** CORPORATE PROPAGANDA - Trump along with Right Wing Media celebrated "bonuses."   The list is endless, but finally and worth repeating again, Donald J Trump is LITERALLY an Unindicted Co-Conspirator. The only reason there is no mugshot of him is that the Office of the Presidency is protecting him...REMINDER - Obama was never an Unindicted Co-Conspirator...  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/29/donald-trump-two-years-halfway-america
You pos have blood on your hands now.  American blood not ISIS blood.  The man who does not telegraph his military moves.  Pos  Liar  you will never see your fuvking wall no matter what it's made of.  You will see wall from inside a cell.    Hi magas.  I had hoped for a wonderful  vacation at mar a lago.   Thznk you America. thankful for all the all forest rakers, my cereal purchasing ID, Saudi leaders and my buddy Vlad, our troops protecting the border against a mythical caravan that might someday arrive with families- women and children fleeing violence and persecution, good guys with guns, good people on both sides, covfefe, disgraced talking-head Sean Hannity, InfoWars for giving us the truth about the Illuminati who truly rule the shadow government, my rotating Cabinet of pals, beautiful chocolate cake, my cool red hat, my weekly golf outing, but most of all, I’m thankful for money and power.   -And now to waste more tax dollars on a wall in no where land but i now own the shutdown.  Screw the federal workers.  They are not part of the one percent.  But I, Donald J. Trump am a great deal maker until today.    Maybe I should resign tomorrow   Yes Donald you should
Fuc your VANITY Trump
Disgusting  and sad
Donald Trump.  If you're going to use a handful of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants as your reason for a border wall, then you need to use the 340 mass shootings, the 666 children ages 0-11 killed or injured by guns, and the 2,830 teens, ages 12-17 killed or injured by guns, all of which impacted American families in 2018.   You have never, ever talked about the families who lost members to gun violence, but have been all too ready to mention a random killing done by an undocumented immigrant.  Americans are much more vulnerable to gun violence than violence from undocumented immigrants.  Your silence on gun violence is shameful and disrespects all families impacted!
It's because she can't wash away their blood in her hands and very obvious, she has no plan to stop  the illegal aliens from coming into the USA to prevent the same crimes that were committed by these aliens against peaceful American families. It is a Deplorable act of a so-called lawmaker and speaker of Congress. She is not a real speaker for the People of this country. she is a speaker for illegal aliens and criminals getting into the country and providing them safe havens and money.
Meanwhile as 45 stirs up fear w/lies his admin poisons  Us!!our land water air all for a buck.   "As the Trump administration considers weakening Obama-era safeguards for the disposal of toxic coal waste, a new report shows that groundwater near all of Texas’ 16 monitored coal-fired power plants is contaminated with pollutants — including known carcinogens such as arsenic— linked to coal ash."  "We found contamination everywhere we looked, poisoning groundwater aquifers and recreational fishing spots across the state,” said EIP attorney Abel Russ, an author of the report." https://www.texastribune.org/2019/01/17/report-texas-coal-power-plants-leaching-toxic-pollutants-groundwater/?fbclid=IwAR06ky2bd_uKPGXJ6Gk-a5to5eqsBeVwebytR_mcss366g8fyfMNLU6R9pI
You're a fucking clown.
How can you fix the broken immigration system, by compromising with the likes of Nancy Pelosi? You've already given in too much, by trying to get her to allow you to build the necessary wall. Declare an emergency, and bring the military in to build the wall. The people coming in, are invaders and should be treated as such.
No wall, EVER. Why? Because you will not be in office for long. Trump's buffoon lawyer Guiliani... "I can tell you his counsel to Michael Cohen throughout that entire period was, 'Tell the truth.' We thought he was telling the truth. I still believe he may have been telling the truth when he testified before Congress," he told host Chuck Todd. Thought they believe Cohen to be nothing but a liar?? Getting awfully difficult to keep track of all their lies! 2019 quote of year - "Impeach the motherfucker"

This isn't Trump's shut down, it's Putin's shut down.  Trump is doing Putin's bidding by crippling our society by its foundation.  Can't you see that Trump is tearing us apart by the seams, he divides us, propelling our young to animalistic hate.  Does this make you feel good?
Arnold Ringer idiot
Arnold Ringer and you are off in the head.and stupid
You have proven my point with your responses.  That's the best you can do?
You're a fucking clown.
Comrade Trump is a liar, crook, thief, cheater, bigot, incompetent, stupid, lazy, con artist, and a traitor. He needs to resign.
Trump lost the last election, his time is up.   What a moron.
State-run news!  Just like the good ol’ Soviet Union!  Well done, Comrade Trump!  🗑 🔥
Trump is a complete and utter moron.....holds 100's of thousands of people hostage while he throws a temper tantrum...what a complete asshole
President Trump you are a man of your word and you make me proud to be an American.....thank you for what you are doing. God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. I have never seen a POTUS love his country like Trump!  Democrats remember #JobsNotMobs.
You have proven my point with your responses.  That's the best you can do?

Because of Trump's policies Black unemployment falls to "LOWEST LEVEL ON RECORD"-Thank you President Trump...Obama did "NOTHING" for the black community. Democrats remember #JobsNotMobs

Trump is the cause of the shutdown.  He had signaled McConnell he would sign the funding bills to keep the government open.  Then McConnell had the Senate vote - by voice vote. Very few, if any, “nays” were said.  Then, extreme right media personalities criticized Trump.  Trump, revealing weakness, changed his mind in response to this criticism, leaving McConnell in a lurch.  Ryan changed the House bill to cover Trump’s changed opinion.  The House and Senate bills could not be reconciled - this was all right before the Christmas holiday.  Trump stated, on live TV, that he would be proud and happy to shut down the government. Trump also stated that he would own the shut down, completely.  I watched this on live TV. No fake news” spin involved.  The government shut down.  The new House passed the exact same bills as those the Senate had passed before Christmas.  McConnell will not bring those bills for a Senate vote again - he knows they would pass and would cause his party great stress.  The immoral and needless shut down is projecting much financial anxiety and pain onto over one MILLION Americans.  Trump is trying to bully in order to look strong in the face of criticism from media celebrities. He would rather hurt Americans than reject the media criticism.  The best way to handle a bully is to stand up to them. Else, they will continue to bully.  Trump is such a lousy negotiator that he relies upon hurting over one million Americans as bargaining chips, as hostages. That is IMMORAL.  I was registered GOP voter (back to Nixon) but have changed to independent as I no longer wanted to be associated with GOP once they had morphed into a group that places party before country- a situation that George Washington warned the country about in his Farewell Address.
I thankful that we still have a President and other Republicans that care about the Angel families!  Pelosi refused to meet with them. What a sorry excuse of a Congresswoman. Disgusting and those voting for her party one day will be sorry.
You need. The wall. Why. Don't.   The. Democrats. She. Your. Try. To. Keep. American. Safe.  And. Drug. Free. Call emergency. Shut. Down. The. Boarder. Your. Doing. A great  job
What is really driving these immigrants to the US?  MARIJUANA!  Nancy Pelosi owns a vineyard, and you can bet she uses people who are here illegally.  Those illegal people are impacting California and the United States in a very serious way:  OUR HOUSING!!!  We in California are not reaping the benefits of the billions of dollars California and other states are reaping from marijuana sales, but the CA government is reaping the benefits, while we pay outrageous rents, leaving little disposable income to spend.  Californians get poorer, but Nancy and other farm and vineyard owners get richer.  NANCY PELOSI OWNS A VINEYARD.  Read this vice article, and you will understand more.  Pelosi and her ilk do not want to register these workers.  They do not pay taxes.  https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/evq7gn/californias-legal-weed-farms-are-replacing-trimmigrants-with-immigrants
Here is some factual reading     Daniel James Holloway January 8 at 8:46 AM A conservative challenged liberal Facebook friends to “make a case, not based on emotion” against Trump’s wall. Conservative buddies flooded his post with snide remarks about how this would be impossible for “deluded libs.”  “Okay, I’ll play,” I responded. And in order to avoid being accused of bias, I explained that I would use only conservative sources to prove my point. My primary source was a policy paper by the Cato Institute, a conservative, rightwing think tank, along with other conservative voices (listed at the end of the piece). Here’s why I’m against the wall, I wrote:  1. Walls don’t work. Illegal immigrants have tunneled underneath and/or erected ramps up and down walls to simply drive over them. People find a way. When East Germany erected its wall, it created a military zone, staffed by booted, machine-gun carrying guards ready to shoot to kill. Yet thousands managed to make it to West Germany anyway. More to the point, do we really want to model ourselves after communist East Germany?  2. Most illegal immigrants are “overstayers.” They come to the US legally — for vacations, business, to study, etc. — and then STAY past their visas. By 2012, overstayers accounted for 58% (THE MAJORITY!) of all unauthorized immigrants. A wall is meaningless here!  3. Walls have little impact on drugs being brought in to the US. According to the DEA, almost all drugs come in through legal points of entry, hidden in secret containers and/or among legit goods in tractor-trailers. A wall will have little to no impact on the influx of drugs into our country.  4. It’s environmentally impractical. Walls have a hard time making it through extreme weather. For example, in 2011, a flood in Arizona washed away 40 feet of STEEL fencing. Torrential rains and raging waters do serious damage. Also, conservative sources generally do not address the environmental harm that walls create, but there is plenty of documentation available that show its potential for irreparable damage to both plant and animal life.  5. A wall would forces the U.S. government to take land from private citizens in eminent domain battles. Private citizens own much of the land slated for the wall. The costs of the government snatching private land — and the legal battles that would ensue — are incalculable.  6. Border patrol agents don’t like concrete or steel walls because they block surveillance capabilities. In other words, they can’t mobilize correctly to meet challenges. So in many ways, a wall makes their job more difficult.  7. Border patrol agents say, “Walls are meaningless without agents and technology to back them up.” Are we prepared to pour countless billions annually — after the wall is built — to create a nearly 2,000 mile, militarized 24-hour surveillance border operation? Because according to patrol agents, that’s the only way a wall would work. Again, are we really, going to use East Germany, a brutal communist state, as our model here?  8. Where walls have been built, there was “no discernable impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens.” In other words, they came in elsewhere, primarily where natural barriers such as water or mountainous regions precluded a wall.  9. An unintended consequence is that a wall blocks farmworkers from EXITING when their invaluable seasonal work is done. Farmers are against the wall because it makes getting cheap seasonal labor almost impossible as few American citizens want or can even do those jobs. And if seasonal worker do get in, a wall makes it harder for them to leave! A wall traps migrant farm laborers in our country.  10. Trump’s $5 billion is a laughable drop in the bucket for what would ACTUALLY be needed. For example, according to the Cato Institute: An estimate for a border wall area that only covered 700 miles was originally 1.2 billion. How much did it REALLY cost? SEVEN BILLION. And that’s only for 700 miles. Whatever we think it’s going to cost, experience shows us we have to multiply it by more than 500%.  11. According to MIT engineers, the wall would cost $31.2 billion. Homeland Security estimates it at $22 billion. Given the pattern of spending mentioned in number 10 (plus Murphy’s Law), that means we’re really talking about pouring endless billions into something that doesn’t even work. And, of course, we taxpayers will be footing the bill, not Mexico. Given all the drawbacks, is that REALLY the best use of our taxes?  As the conservatives of the Cato Institute put it, “President Trump’s wall would be a mammoth expenditure that would have little impact on illegal immigration.” (Emphasis mine) Also it would create many “direct harms:” “the spending, the taxes, the eminent domain abuse, and the decrease in immigrant’s freedoms of movement.”  And, we must add, since conservative sources do not — that the environmental harms are likely to be severe.  In other words, the facts show that walls don’t work and they create even bigger, more expensive problems.  So what happened after I posted this conservative-sourced, fact-based list of why the wall is a bad idea?  Silence.  I waited for someone to respond, to engage with me. Where were the angry defenses or rebuttals? But when I searched for the post after a few days, I couldn’t find it.  My FB friend had deleted it. You could say, like Trump with the government, he shut me down rather than deal with the facts.  The ugly genius of Trump is his ability to manipulate deep, primal emotions — namely fear and hate. He, along with Fox News, have convinced his base that they are in “extreme danger” from immigrants and only a wall will make them “safe.”  Unfortunately, the need to “feel” safe is much stronger than the will to grapple with a complex, multi-faceted problem.  And so, here we are, paralyzed by shutdowns at every turn.

They wanted DACA and STP and now Trump has offered all 3 and now they dont want it. Ive seen kids do that, they throw a tantrum and finally you give in and then they say no I dont want it.

Take the crooks out of there chairs people .
Real News we know you lied about having business with Russia you were trying to build a trump tower, so why the lying
You are a liar
You do realize that swamp thang is manipulating you. These heart breaking stories meant to assault ones sensibilities and inflame those already buying into racial division. The parents of the victims of school shooting also have heart breaking stories and their are more of them than there are victims of violence related to refugees/immigrants. This made up crisis is there simply to deflect from the multiple investigations into Swamp thang, his administration,his foundation and relationships with numerous foreign entities.  The deal he offered was not made in good faith. How can you hold hundreds of thousand people hostage and forced slavery in exchange for holding another vulnerable group hostage for future leverage?  There is nothing good or presidential about swamp thang. He represents the very worst of what humanity has to offer. Shame on you swamp thang,shame on your administration and shame on the party of trump. I have faith that the american people are a hell of a lot smarter than you give them credit for and see right through your manipulations. People and paychecks before Vanity walls.
Trump is a POOR negotiator.  He tweets responses to tv host Ann Coulter over her criticism of him. He’s terrified of her .  Trump is a WIMP.   Trump works for Ann Coulter.  Not the American people.  Trump chooses to use the financial hardship of 800,000 Federal workers as PAWNS.   It’s like negotiating with a gun to their heads.
We are behind you 100% President Trump 🇺🇸. It's about time a President of the USA puts AMERICA FIRST!  Stay the course and don't let those lying cheating democrats take you off course! We see and understand the lies they are telling and we aren't buying it. We see their numbers don't add up. You are right with all the drugs and human trafficking that goes on with illegals we MUST do something and NOW is the time. Stay the course.
Petition of Remonstrance William Sharpe  Fellow Americans, 16 January 2019 The most powerful weapon that we the people have to control the government, servants of the people, is a formal petition of remonstrance. It will put the fear of God into any politician. The formal petition process to impeach and remove any public servant, elected official, appointed or the receiving of emoluments we would do through something called a petition of remonstrance. You file the petition of remonstrance with the legislators with the charges of treason against the people in whom violated the oath of office, these are impeachable offenses and these people can never hold office again. You have to remember that they have publicly stated their stance against The Constitution, a violation of their oath of office, going against the will of the people, showing disregard for our laws! We the people’s laws are that of the Constitution, The Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, these are the laws that control them and they are stating they want more power and they are not willing to comply with the terms of employment through their oath of office.  Basically these political parties corporations, religious organizations and politicians, by proxy are performing what is known as a hostile takeover in the corporate and business world or the overthrow of a particular corporation or business and in the government sector this is called a coup d’état or the overthrow of the government or country or the established political will of the people. When you took your oath of office, and swore an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of The United States of America and you use the emoluments provided by the people for the sole purpose to defend that Constitution and then you pronounce to work to destroy that same constitution that you swore an oath to protect and defend, you have committed perjury and theft against the people and your oath! This is a criminal act, an impeachable offense! It shows that you have performed an immoral act in which proves you to be untrustworthy to hold that position granted to you by the people whose trust you betrayed.  This is fraud and there is no statue of limitations on fraud! You have violated the will of the people and their trust through your actions of perjury with your own lies with the sole purpose and intent to deceive, steal faith and the trust of the people. You are embezzling emoluments for your own personal, financial and political gain which is theft by design. I would also say it is a violation of your terms of employment! The Democrats work exclusively for the American Bar Association. The Bar Association works exclusively for the Roman Catholic Church/Government and Islam, and any other foreign country that is working to destroy America. They do not care about the American people. They do not work for the American people. They are liars, thieves and deceivers of the highest magnitude!  https://youtu.be/i9XZUlf0wIE?fbclid=IwAR0qvVsda5fgelTJAM0zSD815CWabJv3GdUxjx_jW-yHEx0Veko_FxMgKM8

Anything that's true and that you fools don't believe, you claim to be false. You're like two year olds... "Not true! Nanny nanny boo boo! I know I am but what are you." Thank God you only represent 20% of the population at this point and it's dropping by the day. In spite of the fake president and his fake claims.
We want you, and people like you, to stop hiring illegals. That will solve the problem immediately.
Will tell Nancy I am 100% behind whatever she does!  But I am 200% sure I don’t want a wall and all the money needing to be spent on it.  T rump will be out of office and that wall won’t be built!  Money right down the drain!  Does he love his American people enough to donate that money out of his own money???  He seems to be afraid and does want that wall for protection. Yes
Get off your tantrum and get this shutdown resolved once and for all! And stop working for the North Koreans, the Chinese and more importantly your friend Putin-Russians. Put America first and NOT your personal interests. Your clothing is made under slave labor conditions, not in the USA but in China and Bangladesh. Also, your daughters clothing was made under slave labor conditions in China! YOU are not putting America first! YOU are not MAGA! Resign today or else you are going to jail for treason in conspiring with the Russians.
Democrat 'Progressivism' is Prime  Rothschild domination tool Creating warfare between middle and lower classes By Dick Eastman 4-18-10  The Rothschilds are promoting class warfare between the growing bottom and the diminutive middle levels of the population. Their goal is to destroy the middle forever, to create a state conditioned proletarian slave class to serve the elite.
This whole thing is a perfect example of why Trump is not a great deal maker and never was. He was never a good business man even - he was given 250 billion by his father which if given to anyone who invested it would have been greater than Trumps net worth today, literally it would have taken no real effort.  Yet he also has declared bankruptcy for multiple business to avoid paying employees - just like government employees go without pay, that’s what happens when you work for this guy.  He tried to back out of the shutdown he declared he would be responsible for yesterday (it never should have happened as the budget is not a tool to manipulate policy). Alas he will fail with China as well, he may get a deal, but his deals are always bad, we will end up less empowered by his deal with China Paving the way for their rise and our demise. This is particularly problematic with the rise of what appears to be a new dictator in China. Be very careful to scrutinize whatever deal he “gets”. When he says it’s great don’t be so quick to believe him, it’s your Children that will suffer the consequence.
i am the uncrowned emperor of subhuman idiot germany since 7 years. they all against me the criminal burgler. fight against them and destroy the metroplitan of the brianless evil brd
Stick the wall up your fat white supremacist Nazi ass, traitor,,,metese pal cono cojedor de cochinas
Pelosi is obviously someone that cant be dealt with. Try to do a deal behind her back with a few select democrats in states u won. If they dont want to deal just do the emergency. Run the country without her. The people can see shes just hates u n doesnt care about the country. Her only goal is to obstruct u for 2  years.
Stick the wall up your fat white supremacist Nazi ass, traitor,,,metese pal cono cojedor de cochinas
Do you know how many AMERICAN BORN KILLERS ARE SITTING ON DEATH ROW EATING THREE MEALS A DAY GETTING MEDICAL ATTENTION.  You will not save this country with a wall period.  DONALD TRUMP "FOLLOWERS" OPEN YOUR EYES AND WIPE YOUR OWN ASS AND THINK FOR YOURSELF AND YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY AMERICANS ARE, ARE CURRENTLY, SUFFERING NOW OVER A WALL. THE HUMAN TRAFFIC SCANDAL IN ARIZONA ALLLLLLLLL AMERICAN BORN POLITICIANS!!! CRIMINALS COME IN ALL NATIONALITIES AND THE BIGGEST CRIMINAL OF ALL IS IN CHARGE OF THIS COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T CARE WHO HE STEPS ONNNNN!! NOT OVER ON!! This is a political statement.  This wall is the most ridiculous thing ever.  "Followers" who can't wipe their own ass and who are waiting on Donald Trump to tell them when to jump and how high voted for this terrorist because they can't think for themselves.  DONALD TRUMP is a TERRORIST: a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

Mr President Build that wall with or without help from congress. The only reason democrats want these illegals here is so they can fast track them to citizenship for votes..They feel a few dead Americans is colateral damage in pursute of that goal and so what..
More :                                                                       Sarsour was honored as one of the “Extraordinary Brooklyn Women,” and has sparked controversy because of her closeness to Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York. The newspapers added that in the past, if you wanted to become mayor of New York, you had to campaign to get closer to the Jews and get their votes, but now in a clear shift, you need to race not only to get the support of Muslims, but the voices of those with ties to Hamas, as is the case Linda Sarsour. Sarsour has also been charged with anti-Semitism because of her public pride that she has relatives who have been convicted of belonging to the terrorist Hamas movement.  Linda’s brother, Jameel Sarsour, is accused of belonging to the terrorist group Hamas and being on the terrorist list of the United States government, under the category of a “specialized international terrorist” by the US Treasury Department. It is strange that Jamil Sarsour lives freely in the U.S. although the government has given him this terrorist label. The FBI agents who investigated him, including FBI agent Robert Wright and retired FBI agent John Vincent, are very angry about it.  Despite this, Sarsour was a familiar face in the Obama White House. The Obama administration opened the White House to adherents of political Islam; they attended hundreds of meetings at the White House. Court documents and other records have confirmed that many of these visitors belong to groups that act as fronts for the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and other Islamic organizations. These investigations were based on a comprehensive analysis of records of visitors to the White House. These meetings were conducted with groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and other groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2013, White House officials received a delegation from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, which is now banned in Egypt and many Arab states as a terror group. It seeks to impose Sharia by force. They visited the White House. And Sarsour confirmed that she was invited to at least seven White House meetings between 2010 and 2014.  Obama is gone from the White House, but Sarsour’s continuing influence on the Left is a bad omen for America, a sign of what will happen in the future.   https://www.jihadwatch.org/.../linda-sarsour-is-a-bad...jihadwatch.org
Well you've been talking wall two plus years and still no wall. The Dems are not going to agree with ANYTHING if it includes wall funding. If  Pelosi's entire family were murdered in front of her by illegals she will not support a wall. This is all about Dems staying in power nothing less. Trump will only get the wall by circumventing the house. His entire presidency rests on this issue. So far we're getting BLAHBLAHBLAH while we are being slaughtered. It will be too bad if we have to resort to other means to protect ourselves because that will be literally opening Pandora's box...
Libtards and leftards are all hypocrites , assface , nearsightedness , paranoia , profit-worship , scum of the earth .
Brent Robinson. Maybe u.and the rest of u.morans and that includes trump.should worry about the problems in our own country before u.think about walls that dont even make sence that r.being dug under anyways.doesnt make sence what so ever.use ur.brain.    We have kids dying in schools at a very bad rate.but u.rep.and trump doesnt care about these kids. There r.shootings here in the u.s.in every dame city at a very high rate and its not immigrants doing this.its americans killing each other .people dying every dame 5 mins in this country.but do u.republicans care.hell no. Demestic.violince on a daily basis.being killed.drunk drivers killing innocent people.  Drive bys.  Gangs killings.robberies.    But nobody wants to talk about this bullshit that is what trump should be focused on. Not boarder walls where theres not a dame problem to begin with.    The national guards r.saying over and over again.drugs r.comming in on airplans.and the waters...u.no this.trump nos this.but u.want to play ignorance and support a man who wont listen to the truth like urselves.    Ur.only reason for trump to do this wall is so u.all can say look he kept his promise.  What about his promise for medical.this is the reason y.he lost the house.people want medical insurance not a stupid f.wall that there going to dig under anyways.  Get it threw ur.heads.
And Nancy can go to hell!  She has a wall, Clinton's have a wall, Blasio & Bloomberg have a wall....Zuckerberg and Bill Gates have walls.  The Hollywood jerks have walls...why not our border?

Jeska H. Cancino snowflakes
Maribel Peterson no snowflake here. Stating facts.  DONALD TRUMP IS HOLDING AMERICAN'S INCOME HOSTAGE UNTIL HE gets what HE wants. I take offense to being called a snowflake, because I am fully aware of what this RUSSIAN WANNA BE dictator is doing to this country.  You can't say you care about AMERICANS AND THEN PUT OVER 80,000 PEOPLE OUT OF WORK.  FACT.
We don’t want your fucking wall, open the government
You are a liar Trump!!!
This illegal explains how they screw over taxpayers by filing and claiming the child tax credit and they say because their is a loop hole they can do it.  https://www.facebook.com/RyanAFournier/videos/vb.101642140171339/1214212042089044/?type=2&theater
FACT: Americans blame trump for shutdown , The house and the senate agreed on a deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!
You are an idiot man-baby, stop the temper tantrum, reopen govt, PAY YOUR SAFETY PERSONNEL!   You are actively making the US less safe!   MAGA=RESIGN.
Nancy needs a trip to the Mexican border so she can see for herself the terror and the sadness that danger brings crossing the border. Human & drug trafficking, pregnant women dying crossing the dessert, women getting rape by gangs , children being kidnapped or left alone in the middle of nowhere. This needs to stop not because we don't want people from South America here in the US but because it's not OK what the immigrants are going through crossing this valley of death. I'm hoping that Mexico can help his people some way or another . Mexico do your fucking job and take care your people now !!!! Trump 2020
Trump two years in: The dealmaker who can’t seem to make a deal
the wall is a waste of money. there has never been a terror attack by anyone crossing the southern border. and the drugs come hidden in vehicles crossing legal ports of entry, by air and by sea. and the three year dreamer extension just keeps them in limbo. need permanent solution but trump afraid of ann coulter.

Your fascist propaganda fools no one. It’s time to remove you from office.
Lara aren’t you ashamed your husband Eric’s Foundation was funneling money from kids with cancer, to pay lawsuits for your father-in-law and large portraits of him.  How can you show your face. You people are without souls or empathy
How about “billionaire” Trump kicking in about $50 million for his wall.  Put your money where your mouth is, cheapskate!
Why would Democrats consider ANY deal with trump before the government is re-opened? trump has reneged on immigration/border security deals at least twice in the past (Jan 2017 and Dec 2018) when Jim Jordan, Tom Cotton, Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, or Sean Hannity have changed trump's mind for trump, after trump told Democrats what he wanted, bipartisan plans were delivered, and then he changed his mind! The man-boy trump needs to stop crying "wolf" or he will never have any credibility.  Ann Coulter is already whining, so, what, deal off again?
IF THIS IS WHAT PRAYER IN SCHOOL TEACHES I’D SAY IT’S A FAIL. McCONNELL’S HOME STATE. THE GOP & TRUMP’S DEAL WITH RUSSIA IS AN ILLEGAL FARCE. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/catholic-school-investigate-taunting-native-americans-n960626?cid=sm_npd_ms_fb_ma
The Secret Service was never contacted by Nancy Pelosi’s office or other Democratic congressional leadership regarding their ability to protect the president, members of the administration and Congress during the State of the Union. official.https://t.co/Wz0dhf4VQ2
The reality is we all know you haven't done s*** about anything for this country. You haven't done s*** about healthcare but f*** it up more. You haven't done s*** about our infrastructure, you f***** it up more. You basically are worthless.
Jon Roberts Western Art I understand you're experiencing delusions however I'm not yelling at you I'm yelling at the idiot.

Linda Sarsour is a Bad Omen for America. This person is a liar, an enemy of the United States and Israel! It will have to be EXPULTED. We are afraid for your safety.  Jan 19, 2019 8:00 am By Rami Dabbas - 30 Comments  Every day more secrets are revealed about the Muslim Brotherhood and the State of Qatar, which stands behind the Muslim Brotherhood and supports it financially and morally through several tools and institutions, both inside Arab countries and in the West, especially in the United States of America, under the cover of the charities and NGO organizations located in those countries.  Linda Sarsour is an Arab American of Palestinian origin and executive director of the New York-based Arab American Society, an association that is administratively linked to the Qatar Foundation International and ideologically follows the Muslim Brotherhood and Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi – a terror promoter — who strongly supports the terrorist Hamas movement and the Qatari government, which is allied with adherents of political Islam. The Qatar Foundation International is closely linked to the Qatari government. Former US Treasury Department analyst Jonathan Schanzer describes the institution as “an ATM for the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliated groups, the spiritual father of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, as well as funding Hamas and terror groups in Syria.” Schanzer stressed that Qatar’s neighbors from Arab countries were “nauseated” by Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Qatar Foundation and the Emir of Qatar established the Al-Qaradawi Research Center in honor of Qaradawi. The purpose of the Center was to promote Al-Qaradawi’s ideas on the basis that he was a pioneer of moderate Islamic thought for Muslims today. In January 2012, the Qatar Foundation (QF) opened a center for Islamic legislation and advocacy. Tariq Ramadan, the grandson of the Brotherhood’s founder Hassan al-Banna and the son of Brotherhood leader Saeed Ramadan, was appointed as the director of research of the center.  At the same time, the Qatar Foundation has strong ties to the International Institute of Islamic Thought, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States that was investigated on terror finance issues after the 9/11 attacks. The deputy director of the Qatar Foundation for Islamic Legislation and Advocacy was Jasser Odeh. At the same time, he taught and lectured at the International Institute of Islamic Thought, as he mentioned in his own profile. The Muslim Brotherhood in the United States described the International Institute of Islamic Thought as one of “our organizations and institutions owned by our friends” in a secret memo issued in 1991. The memo states that the purpose of its network in the United States is “a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destructing Western civilization from within.”  Now we come back to Linda Sarsour, who also has suspicious personal relationships. In 2004, Sarsour told the press that the US authorities questioned her and her Palestinian husband Maher Judeh, who was threatened with deportation after living in the United States for seven years. In the same interview, Sarsour mentioned that one of her cousins spent 25 years in prison in Israel, and that a family friend was sentenced to 99 years in prison. She added that her unmarried brother was also serving a 12-month sentence for being a member of Hamas.  The New York Police Department opened an investigation into the relationships of the Arab-American Association, headed by Linda Sarsour, and tried to obtain information about its board members. It found that its chairman was Dr. Ahmed Jaber, head of the Dawood mosque, known as the Islamic Mission in America. Sarsour is constantly trying to portray law enforcement officials and the government as unfair to Muslims, and her claims and fears of terrorist plots are in fact government conspiracies, according to Sarsour.  For example, Sarsour said that New York police detectives fabricated terror cases so they could get funding for the New York Police Department. The government stopped an al-Qaeda plot to destroy an aircraft using an explosive device hidden in a person’s underwear: Sarsour claimed the attacker was actually a CIA agent. In an interview, Sarsour said that “fear of Islam” is merely a manifestation of American persecution of minorities, and the United States remains a democratic state with an authoritarian element. Sarsour is known to launch fierce attacks on Muslim Brotherhood opponents, including Muslim dissidents themselves, so the Qatar-affiliated Brotherhood put its money in the right place when it decided to invest in her organization.
More : Sarsour was honored as one of the “Extraordinary Brooklyn Women,” and has sparked controversy because of her closeness to Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York. The newspapers added that in the past, if you wanted to become mayor of New York, you had to campaign to get closer to the Jews and get their votes, but now in a clear shift, you need to race not only to get the support of Muslims, but the voices of those with ties to Hamas, as is the case Linda Sarsour. Sarsour has also been charged with anti-Semitism because of her public pride that she has relatives who have been convicted of belonging to the terrorist Hamas movement.

GO BACK TO SCHOOL BEFORE YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTHS!  CAN NOT BELIEVE A MEXICAN CAN WRITE AND SPEAK BETTER THAN ALL OF YOU HATERS.   Respectfully; "I AM" Omar Martinez   "I AM" COMING PERVERT, "I AM" COMING.
YOU DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH PLEDGE AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ELECTED HAD YOU PRESENTED YOURSELF THAT WAY.    YOU!!!  "Promised" to end DACA.  Build the Wall.  End chain migration.  Offer legislation to change immigration law.  You were going to DEMAND the additional manpower necessary to accomplish the deportation of every person who entered this country illegally.   YOU  lied.  You surrendered on DACA almost immediately. You submitted your FINAL surrender to the American people last year when having given you and your Party what you demanded, the presidency and both Houses of Congress, you REFUSED to Veto and signed that horrible Omnibus bill.    So much more.  Like full funding Planned Parenthood and the like.  Everything that matters long term for the sake of our progeny, like who lives and dies and who comes into this country and stays, YOU intentionally failed us on.    Have a nice day, orange guy.  When they come for you for impeachment, i'm going to change the channel.
These students (1) are actually more mature than President Trump and that is not saying much. The students demonstrated that they are good at stare downs. Some have some decent dance moves. But, are they good at math, science, history? Can you put 'good at stare downs' on a job resume?  Do these young parasites represent the future of MAGA? BTW - the natives didn't stop with the expression of their history, but the boys face expulsion just as President Trump faces the likelihood of impeachment.

If you know a Federal employee, just ask them what they think is more important, their next paycheck or Trump’s folly.
You are fighting, you've shut down the government, you dolt.
What Pelosi is not telling you is that 81,500 migrants were released into our communities in "Oct. & Nov. alone".    Oct. SW Border Total  Apprehensions       50,975 Inadmissibles           9,770 Admitted to U.S.    41,205  Nov. SW Border Total  Apprehensions       51,856 Inadmissibles         10,600 Admitted to U.S.     40,256  https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration
MAGA!!!!!! They are going to say it openly, sooner or later, in the US.  The best policy for China is to liberate the North Korea. A free North Korean republic where the decimated 25 million 'half-animals' are born again as human beings  along the path of liberty, dignity and fair market! This will galvanize 1.4 bil. Chinese people. And also this will dismantle the moonJaeIn regime which is taking advatage of the false dilemma 'War vs. Peace'. Moonjaein, xijinping, and kimjongun are faithful servants and asslickers of satan
You also made a pledge to represent all Americans. Now I know you can’t do that cuz we all have different opinions. But atleast represent the fuckin majority. And the majority think your personal monument, referred to as a wall, is stupid and a waste of funds.
The Democrats do not care that their children are on drugs?
You are the Devil’s messenger.  You make life hell for everyone.

Good but don't compromise and let the Democrats keep all those in who are already here.  Start w/ deporting all illegals who have committed rape, murder, theft.....  And stop the freebies!  If they don't get everything for free, you'll eliminate a lot of the illegal crossings.
TRUMP SHUTDOWN DAY #30!  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT YOU  DEMAGOGUE! YOU COULD HAVE  HAD A REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED  SENATE AND HOUSE PASS YOUR  WALL FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS  MOTHERFUCKER!  TRUMP DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ANYTHING   OR ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF AND HIS BRATS  TRUMP WON'T APPROVE A FINAL RESOLUTION   OF DACA..TO GIVE THEM A PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP AND TRUMP WANTS TO CUT  LEGAL IMMIGRATION BY FIFTY PERCENT!
This country has a cancer within. Trump is a last greatest hope.
And fix ITIN, illegals claim 9 -10 children on their taxes and those kids don't even live here, illegals getting back 10k and More for refunds, stupid loophole!!!
Coward
Benedict Donald, you are a liar, thief, coward and con artist. Oh, I almost forgot that you are also a TRAITOR! Your melodramatic reality TV stunts won't distract justice from catching up with you. Prepare for prison in 2019.
Coward
You are manufacturing a false crisis so that you can fulfill a nincompoop campaign promise that you didn't even explore before you started shooting off your fat mouth. You're a fool. And your minions are a con man's dream...
Why can't people be themselves?
Lily-Ann Silva a minor point at such a moment. I think you're on the wrong thread.
Lily-Ann Silva if you mean Donald Trump, he works on my dime. He does what I want. He's a public servant. And no, he is not allowed to be himself. We were all hoping that he would tone himself down, listen to his advisors and his generals and the people that have more experience in government than him. He could have done this right, he could have combined his knowledge of finance and their knowledge of politics, government and Military and been a good president. But no. He's got to act like a thug or a spoiled two-year-old and do all kinds of fucked up stuff AND lie every single day of his presidency. The fact that this country doesn't care that our president lies every time he opens his mouth is a disgusting situation. And it's worth being angry over. This is not what our forefathers OR the millions of people who shed their blood for our freedom had in mind. We have no allies. He's pulling us out of every single peaceful agreement that we have worked so hard to be part of and lead the world with. You better hope nobody drops a bomb on us. Nobody would come to our rescue. Not even Canada.

We need to get rid of welfare.food stamps  , subsidies on housing,wic ...get a job and pay for yourself....the the people that work every day are tired of supporting all these people....use that money it more the enough to pay for the wall and to make America great again ...Americans can have free education and medical for all the money we give away to people who don't work  ...make them work like the rest of us...I dont work my Bill's dont get paid it's that simple
Sabryna Klug At one time in my life I had to use the system. What was surprising was you got raises for not working. More money financially and for food. I didn't even have another child. Thats why people stay on it, you're spoiled, why work.
Lily-Ann Silva ...I know and it needs to stop ...tell them to get a job no more free money  ...I have worked my whole life and raised 4 kids ....let send people to school so they can support themselves  not make them dependent

I can't make this statement often enough. I really want to vote for Trump in 2020, but, I won't unless he keep these 3 promises he made to us during his campaign. 1). I want Hillary/The Clinton Foundation prosecuted. 2). I want progress on the Wall. Funding and the wall being started. 3). I want Obama Care repealed. No, I didn't say fixed or a work around or even kind of repealed. I want it Repealed. And NO(!) repealing the "mandate" is NOT the same thing as a repeal. And no, he didn't promise to FIX Obamacare. Donald Trump was clear, he promised to repeal the most oppressive legislation ever imposed on the American people. These points are nonnegotiable; period. Many of you have already told I should reconsider, I've listened to you, with respect, and disagree. We need to do something besides the same old same old thing. The GOP is no longer our friends. Their failure to keep their word on the Obamacare repeal is proof. We all know, or should know by now, they never intended to repeal the most oppressive piece of legislation ever imposed on the American people. Yet, many will tell me "we have to vote for them again". I ask you why? If Trump wants my vote in 2020, he should keep his word.
The Democrats want illegal immigrants to come into the country to vote Democrat and keep them in power forever!! Democrats seek power at any cost! The Liberal Elite and Hollywood including the Democrat Politicians have huge walls around their houses with 24 hour top of the range security, they are safe and crime don't effect or involve them!!
Trump needs to put Pelosi on a plane with the victims mother's
If Nancy  is so worried  about the works not getting  paid do like Trump give your pay to them , you selfish  Bitch
Nancy if we can't get a wall make a big ditch from sea to shining sea !!! Half mile across !!! Those Mexicans and Hondurans arms will be tired before they arrive !!!And by the time they do a few openings for citizenship might be opened as well ??? P.S. Alligators must be fed too !!!
Most Americans can't stand your stupid ass !!! Go away!! Ideot closing down government all because you want a wall... morons it's not hard to get over a wall i don't care how much security there is!

No one said you had to stop fighting. Just go back to fighting your family members and your subcontractors. All we ask is that you confine the damage to the few miserable people who have no choice but to deal with you. Wives, children, and people you owe money.
We are behind you 100% President Trump 🇺🇸. It's about time a President of the USA puts AMERICA FIRST!  Stay the course and don't let those lying cheating democrats take you off course! We see and understand the lies they are telling and we aren't buying it. We see their numbers don't add up. You are right with all the drugs and human trafficking that goes on with illegals we MUST do something and NOW is the time. Stay the course.
That doesn't fix the immigration system Only a Democratic Congress can do that.  Trump is nothing short of INSANE.
Fake women are not going to listen to real women that is just how it goes, you see these fake ass women everyday, but you don't say nothing to them because they have good lies working with their fake asses: how many are tied of being politically correct, how many of you are tied of these fake ass people pretending to be something they are not
Clinton started it. Bush and Obama built it. Trump just wants to continue what DEMOCRATS started.   The battle over expanding the US-Mexico border fence has shut down the government.  #CutThroughTheNoise around the showdown over Trump's wall. https://www.facebook.com/228735667216/posts/10156420521092217/
But  yet  she  can  go  to  Hawaii on  vacation,  and  flee  the  country  when  she  is  made  to  look  like  a  fool. She  is horrible
President Trump inspires us all to live a better life. A more dignified, Christian Billionaire lifestyle. He will bring back the awesome China factory jobs. I can feel the MAGA, running through me. Let's find the key and turn this engine on. Bring America home Donald. 🇺🇸🧠💪🔥🍟🍔🍟🔥💪🧠🇺🇸
Giuliani admits that trump kept negotiating for the Moscow tower project throughout the campaign and up to the election
Quit using victims of violence as props you fucking moron. Gun violence kills more children and adults committed by extreme Republican terrorists born in the states. And what ever happened to Mexico paying for the wall asshole?

Sorry, I was wrong Bob. The latest average of all polls shows Trump T 40.0%. The 41.1% is about 3 days old. That is how fast Trump’s approval rating is falling. I should have waited till Monday to say the numbers were below 40%, they are AT exactly 40% today.  Good to see you are supporting a 41% Presidential rating. Most of his followers insist he has a 50-60% positive rating. Hope you continue to support Trump when he falls below 35% favorable.

If you put a laughing reaction, you are TRASH!
Trump is a cowardly grifter desperately trying to cover up his incompetence. He had two years to fix this without acting like a child but now it’s suddenly important to clean up a mess he created and pins on others (of course.) This is just trump’s last attempt at taking advantage of his supporters stupidity and fake patriotism. I haven’t heard anything new about infrastructure, healthcare or any other issue that’s important to the 95% of real Americans. Trump’s a cowardly third rate grifter and his supporters are morons.
You should make a pledge to do something about the mass slaughtering of innocent citizens and children in America. You, Donald J. Trump, did nothing.

So Pelosi states "NO" prior to the speech. She and her group want the Gov't opened, then they will proceed to "talk". Let's see now: You loan me $500,000 now, and later we will "talk" & I will agree to sign the Contract, well maybe and maybe NOT.  Hilarious !

Trump has pissed both sides off with his latest proposals. The right hate the fact he is talking about amnesty for the Dreamers. The left say it’s a nonstarter with Trump holding the government workers hostage.   His approval rating is now under 40%, a death sign for all Republican office holders. Not a good time to have a last name ending in Trump or being part of the Trump led cult.   The Trump bandwagon broke down many miles ago. It is sitting on the side of the road with broken wheels and flies buzzing all around. The buzzards are circling overhead, they are attracted by the smell political rot.

It is sitting on the side of the road with broken wheels and flies buzzing all around. The buzzards are circling overhead, they are attracted by the smell political rot.
President Trump inspires us all to live a better life. A more dignified, Christian Billionaire lifestyle. He will bring back the awesome China factory jobs. I can feel the MAGA, running through me. Let's find the key and turn this engine on. Bring America home Donald. 🇺🇸🧠💪🔥🍟🍔🍟🔥💪🧠🇺🇸
But  yet  she  can  go  to  Hawaii on  vacation,  and  flee  the  country  when  she  is  made  to  look  like  a  fool. She  is horrible
Clinton started it. Bush and Obama built it. Trump just wants to continue what DEMOCRATS started.   The battle over expanding the US-Mexico border fence has shut down the government.  #CutThroughTheNoise around the showdown over Trump's wall. https://www.facebook.com/228735667216/posts/10156420521092217/
Fake women are not going to listen to real women that is just how it goes, you see these fake ass women everyday, but you don't say nothing to them because they have good lies working with their fake asses: how many are tied of being politically correct, how many of you are tied of these fake ass people pretending to be something they are not
That doesn't fix the immigration system Only a Democratic Congress can do that.  Trump is nothing short of INSANE.
We are behind you 100% President Trump 🇺🇸. It's about time a President of the USA puts AMERICA FIRST!  Stay the course and don't let those lying cheating democrats take you off course! We see and understand the lies they are telling and we aren't buying it. We see their numbers don't add up. You are right with all the drugs and human trafficking that goes on with illegals we MUST do something and NOW is the time. Stay the course.
No one said you had to stop fighting. Just go back to fighting your family members and your subcontractors. All we ask is that you confine the damage to the few miserable people who have no choice but to deal with you. Wives, children, and people you owe money.
Julian Kruger WHAT?
To hell with Nancy and build the wall
If Nancy  is so worried  about the works not getting  paid do like Trump give your pay to them , you selfish  Bitch
Trump needs to put Pelosi on a plane with the victims mother's
Pelosi is a disgrace to our country !!!

No wall you idiot. Face facts. It aint going to happen.
No wall you idiot. Face facts. It aint going to happen.
The Democrats want illegal immigrants to come into the country to vote Democrat and keep them in power forever!! Democrats seek power at any cost! The Liberal Elite and Hollywood including the Democrat Politicians have huge walls around their houses with 24 hour top of the range security, they are safe and crime don't effect or involve them!!
I can't make this statement often enough. I really want to vote for Trump in 2020, but, I won't unless he keep these 3 promises he made to us during his campaign. 1). I want Hillary/The Clinton Foundation prosecuted. 2). I want progress on the Wall. Funding and the wall being started. 3). I want Obama Care repealed. No, I didn't say fixed or a work around or even kind of repealed. I want it Repealed. And NO(!) repealing the "mandate" is NOT the same thing as a repeal. And no, he didn't promise to FIX Obamacare. Donald Trump was clear, he promised to repeal the most oppressive legislation ever imposed on the American people. These points are nonnegotiable; period. Many of you have already told I should reconsider, I've listened to you, with respect, and disagree. We need to do something besides the same old same old thing. The GOP is no longer our friends. Their failure to keep their word on the Obamacare repeal is proof. We all know, or should know by now, they never intended to repeal the most oppressive piece of legislation ever imposed on the American people. Yet, many will tell me "we have to vote for them again". I ask you why? If Trump wants my vote in 2020, he should keep his word.
Sabryna Klug At one time in my life I had to use the system. What was surprising was you got raises for not working. More money financially and for food. I didn't even have another child. Thats why people stay on it, you're spoiled, why work.
We need to get rid of welfare.food stamps  , subsidies on housing,wic ...get a job and pay for yourself....the the people that work every day are tired of supporting all these people....use that money it more the enough to pay for the wall and to make America great again ...Americans can have free education and medical for all the money we give away to people who don't work  ...make them work like the rest of us...I dont work my Bill's dont get paid it's that simple
Lily-Ann Silva a minor point at such a moment. I think you're on the wrong thread.
Why can't people be themselves?
You are manufacturing a false crisis so that you can fulfill a nincompoop campaign promise that you didn't even explore before you started shooting off your fat mouth. You're a fool. And your minions are a con man's dream...

TRUMP SHUTDOWN DAY #30!  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT YOU  DEMAGOGUE! YOU COULD HAVE  HAD A REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED  SENATE AND HOUSE PASS YOUR  WALL FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS  MOTHERFUCKER!  TRUMP DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ANYTHING   OR ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF AND HIS BRATS  TRUMP WON'T APPROVE A FINAL RESOLUTION   OF DACA..TO GIVE THEM A PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP AND TRUMP WANTS TO CUT  LEGAL IMMIGRATION BY FIFTY PERCENT!
Good but don't compromise and let the Democrats keep all those in who are already here.  Start w/ deporting all illegals who have committed rape, murder, theft.....  And stop the freebies!  If they don't get everything for free, you'll eliminate a lot of the illegal crossings.
Benedict Donald, you are a liar, thief, coward and con artist. Oh, I almost forgot that you are also a TRAITOR! Your melodramatic reality TV stunts won't distract justice from catching up with you. Prepare for prison in 2019.

You are the Devil’s messenger.  You make life hell for everyone.
The Democrats do not care that their children are on drugs?
You also made a pledge to represent all Americans. Now I know you can’t do that cuz we all have different opinions. But atleast represent the fuckin majority. And the majority think your personal monument, referred to as a wall, is stupid and a waste of funds.
MAGA!!!!!! They are going to say it openly, sooner or later, in the US.  The best policy for China is to liberate the North Korea. A free North Korean republic where the decimated 25 million 'half-animals' are born again as human beings  along the path of liberty, dignity and fair market! This will galvanize 1.4 bil. Chinese people. And also this will dismantle the moonJaeIn regime which is taking advatage of the false dilemma 'War vs. Peace'. Moonjaein, xijinping, and kimjongun are faithful servants and asslickers of satan

YOU DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH PLEDGE AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ELECTED HAD YOU PRESENTED YOURSELF THAT WAY.    YOU!!!  "Promised" to end DACA.  Build the Wall.  End chain migration.  Offer legislation to change immigration law.  You were going to DEMAND the additional manpower necessary to accomplish the deportation of every person who entered this country illegally.   YOU  lied.  You surrendered on DACA almost immediately. You submitted your FINAL surrender to the American people last year when having given you and your Party what you demanded, the presidency and both Houses of Congress, you REFUSED to Veto and signed that horrible Omnibus bill.    So much more.  Like full funding Planned Parenthood and the like.  Everything that matters long term for the sake of our progeny, like who lives and dies and who comes into this country and stays, YOU intentionally failed us on.    Have a nice day, orange guy.  When they come for you for impeachment, i'm going to change the channel.
POTUS;   Been reading Your followers' posts.     Not ONLY DO THEY HATE LIKE YOU,  BUT THEY CAN NOT EVEN WRITE PERFECT SENTENCES?  WHAT!  HATERS AND ILLITERATE?

Why would Democrats consider ANY deal with trump before the government is re-opened? trump has reneged on immigration/border security deals at least twice in the past (Jan 2017 and Dec 2018) when Jim Jordan, Tom Cotton, Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, or Sean Hannity have changed trump's mind for trump, after trump told Democrats what he wanted, bipartisan plans were delivered, and then he changed his mind! The man-boy trump needs to stop crying "wolf" or he will never have any credibility.  Ann Coulter is already whining, so, what, deal off again?
How about “billionaire” Trump kicking in about $50 million for his wall.  Put your money where your mouth is, cheapskate!

You only make pledges to your base , you couldn't give two shits about anybody else. Actually you don't even care about your base because everybody knows it's all about you. You're like a grown mentally disturbed child playing adult games. You've never ran a successful business in your life and you expect to be able to run this country. the only running you will be doing is running this country into the ground. Those midterms were just the beginning. Even if the Mueller report didn't exist you're still not worthy to serve. When they throw you out of office and I hope they do it soon, they need to remove your name, your picture and your stench from the Halls of the White House and Capitol Hill.

the wall is a waste of money. there has never been a terror attack by anyone crossing the southern border. and the drugs come hidden in vehicles crossing legal ports of entry, by air and by sea. and the three year dreamer extension just keeps them in limbo. need permanent solution but trump afraid of ann coulter.
Trump two years in: The dealmaker who can’t seem to make a deal
Nancy needs a trip to the Mexican border so she can see for herself the terror and the sadness that danger brings crossing the border. Human & drug trafficking, pregnant women dying crossing the dessert, women getting rape by gangs , children being kidnapped or left alone in the middle of nowhere. This needs to stop not because we don't want people from South America here in the US but because it's not OK what the immigrants are going through crossing this valley of death. I'm hoping that Mexico can help his people some way or another . Mexico do your fucking job and take care your people now !!!! Trump 2020
You are an idiot man-baby, stop the temper tantrum, reopen govt, PAY YOUR SAFETY PERSONNEL!   You are actively making the US less safe!   MAGA=RESIGN.
FACT: Americans blame trump for shutdown , The house and the senate agreed on a deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!

We have kids dying in schools at a very bad rate.but u.rep.and trump doesnt care about these kids. There r.shootings here in the u.s.in every dame city at a very high rate and its not immigrants doing this.its americans killing each other .people dying every dame 5 mins in this country.but do u.republicans care.hell no. Demestic.violince on a daily basis.being killed.drunk drivers killing innocent people.  Drive bys.  Gangs killings.robberies.    But nobody wants to talk about this bullshit that is what trump should be focused on. Not boarder walls where theres not a dame problem to begin with.    The national guards r.saying over and over again.drugs r.comming in on airplans.and the waters...u.no this.trump nos this.but u.want to play ignorance and support a man who wont listen to the truth like urselves.    Ur.only reason for trump to do this wall is so u.all can say look he kept his promise.

Well you've been talking wall two plus years and still no wall. The Dems are not going to agree with ANYTHING if it includes wall funding. If  Pelosi's entire family were murdered in front of her by illegals she will not support a wall. This is all about Dems staying in power nothing less. Trump will only get the wall by circumventing the house. His entire presidency rests on this issue. So far we're getting BLAHBLAHBLAH while we are being slaughtered. It will be too bad if we have to resort to other means to protect ourselves because that will be literally opening Pandora's box...
More :                                                                       Sarsour was honored as one of the “Extraordinary Brooklyn Women,” and has sparked controversy because of her closeness to Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York. The newspapers added that in the past, if you wanted to become mayor of New York, you had to campaign to get closer to the Jews and get their votes, but now in a clear shift, you need to race not only to get the support of Muslims, but the voices of those with ties to Hamas, as is the case Linda Sarsour. Sarsour has also been charged with anti-Semitism because of her public pride that she has relatives who have been convicted of belonging to the terrorist Hamas movement.  Linda’s brother, Jameel Sarsour, is accused of belonging to the terrorist group Hamas and being on the terrorist list of the United States government, under the category of a “specialized international terrorist” by the US Treasury Department. It is strange that Jamil Sarsour lives freely in the U.S. although the government has given him this terrorist label. The FBI agents who investigated him, including FBI agent Robert Wright and retired FBI agent John Vincent, are very angry about it.  Despite this, Sarsour was a familiar face in the Obama White House. The Obama administration opened the White House to adherents of political Islam; they attended hundreds of meetings at the White House. Court documents and other records have confirmed that many of these visitors belong to groups that act as fronts for the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and other Islamic organizations. These investigations were based on a comprehensive analysis of records of visitors to the White House. These meetings were conducted with groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and other groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2013, White House officials received a delegation from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, which is now banned in Egypt and many Arab states as a terror group. It seeks to impose Sharia by force. They visited the White House. And Sarsour confirmed that she was invited to at least seven White House meetings between 2010 and 2014.  Obama is gone from the White House, but Sarsour’s continuing influence on the Left is a bad omen for America, a sign of what will happen in the future.   https://www.jihadwatch.org/.../linda-sarsour-is-a-bad...jihadwatch.org
Mr President Build that wall with or without help from congress. The only reason democrats want these illegals here is so they can fast track them to citizenship for votes..They feel a few dead Americans is colateral damage in pursute of that goal and so what..
This whole thing is a perfect example of why Trump is not a great deal maker and never was. He was never a good business man even - he was given 250 billion by his father which if given to anyone who invested it would have been greater than Trumps net worth today, literally it would have taken no real effort.  Yet he also has declared bankruptcy for multiple business to avoid paying employees - just like government employees go without pay, that’s what happens when you work for this guy.  He tried to back out of the shutdown he declared he would be responsible for yesterday (it never should have happened as the budget is not a tool to manipulate policy). Alas he will fail with China as well, he may get a deal, but his deals are always bad, we will end up less empowered by his deal with China Paving the way for their rise and our demise. This is particularly problematic with the rise of what appears to be a new dictator in China. Be very careful to scrutinize whatever deal he “gets”. When he says it’s great don’t be so quick to believe him, it’s your Children that will suffer the consequence.
Democrat 'Progressivism' is Prime  Rothschild domination tool Creating warfare between middle and lower classes By Dick Eastman 4-18-10  The Rothschilds are promoting class warfare between the growing bottom and the diminutive middle levels of the population. Their goal is to destroy the middle forever, to create a state conditioned proletarian slave class to serve the elite.
Get off your tantrum and get this shutdown resolved once and for all! And stop working for the North Koreans, the Chinese and more importantly your friend Putin-Russians. Put America first and NOT your personal interests. Your clothing is made under slave labor conditions, not in the USA but in China and Bangladesh. Also, your daughters clothing was made under slave labor conditions in China! YOU are not putting America first! YOU are not MAGA! Resign today or else you are going to jail for treason in conspiring with the Russians.

Will tell Nancy I am 100% behind whatever she does!  But I am 200% sure I don’t want a wall and all the money needing to be spent on it.  T rump will be out of office and that wall won’t be built!  Money right down the drain!  Does he love his American people enough to donate that money out of his own money???  He seems to be afraid and does want that wall for protection. Yes
We want you, and people like you, to stop hiring illegals. That will solve the problem immediately.

Anything that's true and that you fools don't believe, you claim to be false. You're like two year olds... "Not true! Nanny nanny boo boo! I know I am but what are you." Thank God you only represent 20% of the population at this point and it's dropping by the day. In spite of the fake president and his fake claims.
Pelosi is obviously someone that cant be dealt with. Try to do a deal behind her back with a few select democrats in states u won. If they dont want to deal just do the emergency. Run the country without her. The people can see shes just hates u n doesnt care about the country. Her only goal is to obstruct u for 2  years.
Petition of Remonstrance William Sharpe  Fellow Americans, 16 January 2019 The most powerful weapon that we the people have to control the government, servants of the people, is a formal petition of remonstrance. It will put the fear of God into any politician. The formal petition process to impeach and remove any public servant, elected official, appointed or the receiving of emoluments we would do through something called a petition of remonstrance. You file the petition of remonstrance with the legislators with the charges of treason against the people in whom violated the oath of office, these are impeachable offenses and these people can never hold office again. You have to remember that they have publicly stated their stance against The Constitution, a violation of their oath of office, going against the will of the people, showing disregard for our laws! We the people’s laws are that of the Constitution, The Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, these are the laws that control them and they are stating they want more power and they are not willing to comply with the terms of employment through their oath of office.  Basically these political parties corporations, religious organizations and politicians, by proxy are performing what is known as a hostile takeover in the corporate and business world or the overthrow of a particular corporation or business and in the government sector this is called a coup d’état or the overthrow of the government or country or the established political will of the people. When you took your oath of office, and swore an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of The United States of America and you use the emoluments provided by the people for the sole purpose to defend that Constitution and then you pronounce to work to destroy that same constitution that you swore an oath to protect and defend, you have committed perjury and theft against the people and your oath! This is a criminal act, an impeachable offense! It shows that you have performed an immoral act in which proves you to be untrustworthy to hold that position granted to you by the people whose trust you betrayed.  This is fraud and there is no statue of limitations on fraud! You have violated the will of the people and their trust through your actions of perjury with your own lies with the sole purpose and intent to deceive, steal faith and the trust of the people. You are embezzling emoluments for your own personal, financial and political gain which is theft by design. I would also say it is a violation of your terms of employment! The Democrats work exclusively for the American Bar Association. The Bar Association works exclusively for the Roman Catholic Church/Government and Islam, and any other foreign country that is working to destroy America. They do not care about the American people. They do not work for the American people. They are liars, thieves and deceivers of the highest magnitude!  https://youtu.be/i9XZUlf0wIE?fbclid=IwAR0qvVsda5fgelTJAM0zSD815CWabJv3GdUxjx_jW-yHEx0Veko_FxMgKM8
We are behind you 100% President Trump 🇺🇸. It's about time a President of the USA puts AMERICA FIRST!  Stay the course and don't let those lying cheating democrats take you off course! We see and understand the lies they are telling and we aren't buying it. We see their numbers don't add up. You are right with all the drugs and human trafficking that goes on with illegals we MUST do something and NOW is the time. Stay the course.
Trump is a POOR negotiator.  He tweets responses to tv host Ann Coulter over her criticism of him. He’s terrified of her .  Trump is a WIMP.   Trump works for Ann Coulter.  Not the American people.  Trump chooses to use the financial hardship of 800,000 Federal workers as PAWNS.   It’s like negotiating with a gun to their heads.
You do realize that swamp thang is manipulating you. These heart breaking stories meant to assault ones sensibilities and inflame those already buying into racial division. The parents of the victims of school shooting also have heart breaking stories and their are more of them than there are victims of violence related to refugees/immigrants. This made up crisis is there simply to deflect from the multiple investigations into Swamp thang, his administration,his foundation and relationships with numerous foreign entities.  The deal he offered was not made in good faith. How can you hold hundreds of thousand people hostage and forced slavery in exchange for holding another vulnerable group hostage for future leverage?  There is nothing good or presidential about swamp thang. He represents the very worst of what humanity has to offer. Shame on you swamp thang,shame on your administration and shame on the party of trump. I have faith that the american people are a hell of a lot smarter than you give them credit for and see right through your manipulations. People and paychecks before Vanity walls.

What is really driving these immigrants to the US?  MARIJUANA!  Nancy Pelosi owns a vineyard, and you can bet she uses people who are here illegally.  Those illegal people are impacting California and the United States in a very serious way:  OUR HOUSING!!!  We in California are not reaping the benefits of the billions of dollars California and other states are reaping from marijuana sales, but the CA government is reaping the benefits, while we pay outrageous rents, leaving little disposable income to spend.  Californians get poorer, but Nancy and other farm and vineyard owners get richer.  NANCY PELOSI OWNS A VINEYARD.  Read this vice article, and you will understand more.  Pelosi and her ilk do not want to register these workers.  They do not pay taxes.  https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/evq7gn/californias-legal-weed-farms-are-replacing-trimmigrants-with-immigrants
You need. The wall. Why. Don't.   The. Democrats. She. Your. Try. To. Keep. American. Safe.  And. Drug. Free. Call emergency. Shut. Down. The. Boarder. Your. Doing. A great  job
I thankful that we still have a President and other Republicans that care about the Angel families!  Pelosi refused to meet with them. What a sorry excuse of a Congresswoman. Disgusting and those voting for her party one day will be sorry.
Trump is the cause of the shutdown.  He had signaled McConnell he would sign the funding bills to keep the government open.  Then McConnell had the Senate vote - by voice vote. Very few, if any, “nays” were said.  Then, extreme right media personalities criticized Trump.  Trump, revealing weakness, changed his mind in response to this criticism, leaving McConnell in a lurch.  Ryan changed the House bill to cover Trump’s changed opinion.  The House and Senate bills could not be reconciled - this was all right before the Christmas holiday.  Trump stated, on live TV, that he would be proud and happy to shut down the government. Trump also stated that he would own the shut down, completely.  I watched this on live TV. No fake news” spin involved.  The government shut down.  The new House passed the exact same bills as those the Senate had passed before Christmas.  McConnell will not bring those bills for a Senate vote again - he knows they would pass and would cause his party great stress.  The immoral and needless shut down is projecting much financial anxiety and pain onto over one MILLION Americans.  Trump is trying to bully in order to look strong in the face of criticism from media celebrities. He would rather hurt Americans than reject the media criticism.  The best way to handle a bully is to stand up to them. Else, they will continue to bully.  Trump is such a lousy negotiator that he relies upon hurting over one million Americans as bargaining chips, as hostages. That is IMMORAL.  I was registered GOP voter (back to Nixon) but have changed to independent as I no longer wanted to be associated with GOP once they had morphed into a group that places party before country- a situation that George Washington warned the country about in his Farewell Address.

Arnold Ringer and you are off in the head.and stupid
Arnold Ringer idiot
This isn't Trump's shut down, it's Putin's shut down.  Trump is doing Putin's bidding by crippling our society by its foundation.  Can't you see that Trump is tearing us apart by the seams, he divides us, propelling our young to animalistic hate.  Does this make you feel good?
Meanwhile as 45 stirs up fear w/lies his admin poisons  Us!!our land water air all for a buck.   "As the Trump administration considers weakening Obama-era safeguards for the disposal of toxic coal waste, a new report shows that groundwater near all of Texas’ 16 monitored coal-fired power plants is contaminated with pollutants — including known carcinogens such as arsenic— linked to coal ash."  "We found contamination everywhere we looked, poisoning groundwater aquifers and recreational fishing spots across the state,” said EIP attorney Abel Russ, an author of the report." https://www.texastribune.org/2019/01/17/report-texas-coal-power-plants-leaching-toxic-pollutants-groundwater/?fbclid=IwAR06ky2bd_uKPGXJ6Gk-a5to5eqsBeVwebytR_mcss366g8fyfMNLU6R9pI
It's because she can't wash away their blood in her hands and very obvious, she has no plan to stop  the illegal aliens from coming into the USA to prevent the same crimes that were committed by these aliens against peaceful American families. It is a Deplorable act of a so-called lawmaker and speaker of Congress. She is not a real speaker for the People of this country. she is a speaker for illegal aliens and criminals getting into the country and providing them safe havens and money.
Donald Trump.  If you're going to use a handful of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants as your reason for a border wall, then you need to use the 340 mass shootings, the 666 children ages 0-11 killed or injured by guns, and the 2,830 teens, ages 12-17 killed or injured by guns, all of which impacted American families in 2018.   You have never, ever talked about the families who lost members to gun violence, but have been all too ready to mention a random killing done by an undocumented immigrant.  Americans are much more vulnerable to gun violence than violence from undocumented immigrants.  Your silence on gun violence is shameful and disrespects all families impacted!
Disgusting  and sad
Fuc your VANITY Trump
You pos have blood on your hands now.  American blood not ISIS blood.  The man who does not telegraph his military moves.  Pos  Liar  you will never see your fuvking wall no matter what it's made of.  You will see wall from inside a cell.    Hi magas.  I had hoped for a wonderful  vacation at mar a lago.   Thznk you America. thankful for all the all forest rakers, my cereal purchasing ID, Saudi leaders and my buddy Vlad, our troops protecting the border against a mythical caravan that might someday arrive with families- women and children fleeing violence and persecution, good guys with guns, good people on both sides, covfefe, disgraced talking-head Sean Hannity, InfoWars for giving us the truth about the Illuminati who truly rule the shadow government, my rotating Cabinet of pals, beautiful chocolate cake, my cool red hat, my weekly golf outing, but most of all, I’m thankful for money and power.   -And now to waste more tax dollars on a wall in no where land but i now own the shutdown.  Screw the federal workers.  They are not part of the one percent.  But I, Donald J. Trump am a great deal maker until today.    Maybe I should resign tomorrow   Yes Donald you should
1. Day 731 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency - Halfway Point) - Halfway Point! What has happened in 731 days? Well, Donald J Trump is LITERALLY an Unindicted Co-Conspirator. We learned that per Donald freaking NAZIS are "good people." Let us go through the list... Con Man Trump taking credit for an economy that was growing when he took office, unlike The Great Recession Obama assumed. ISIS was in effect defeated b/c Iraq Citizens decided to fight and die along with our Ally the Kurds. North Korea Kim Jon Un had NEVER met the President of China. Now, they are best pals and North Korea still has Nuclear Weapons (just not testing missiles). Iran Deal canceled pissing off EU, Britain, France, Germany, China, & Russia (Iran was complying). USA withdrew from TPP, though, the 11 other nations continued to negotiate and signed the trade deal (Has Trump negotiated any Trade Deals?). A new NAFTA was negotiated which changed percentages and called something else to look like Donald negotiated an incredible deal.  What else? Donald has LIED repeatedly about the Criminal Conspiracy with Russia but still denies any "collusion."  DEFICITS - The Uneducated White Trump Voter (REMEMBER The Tea Party) no longer cares about Deficits. During the Great Recession, Obama ran Trillion Dollar Deficits and these people screamed! The USA will begin running Trillion Dollar YEARLY Deficits this year and The Uneducated White Trump Voter will blame Pelosi and Democrats.  Tax Cuts - The top 1% received a Tax Cut along with Corporations who were making record profits. ** CORPORATE PROPAGANDA - Trump along with Right Wing Media celebrated "bonuses."   The list is endless, but finally and worth repeating again, Donald J Trump is LITERALLY an Unindicted Co-Conspirator. The only reason there is no mugshot of him is that the Office of the Presidency is protecting him...REMINDER - Obama was never an Unindicted Co-Conspirator...  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/29/donald-trump-two-years-halfway-america
Except you've turned down every safe border policy because it doesn't fund your ineffective wall.  Some your border security policies are great, but your wall will not stop significant amounts of drugs or illegals. Immigrants, and especially deportable immigrants, are our lowest violent crime and drug population.  I am with you, however, on making the lives of our border patrol agents easier. So are the democrats who have met every single one of your demands in compromise, even offering to give you some money for the wall.  I don't want to pay even a cent for it. You said "Mexico will pay for the wall". Keep that promise and you can have the colossal waste of resources you so desperately desire.  Meanwhile, reopen the government that you shut down Mr. President. Those families are actually suffering. They have actually had their job stolen. You said you would "proudly* do this. I am asking you, desperately, for families, for single men and women, for US children and elderly who depend on support networks to survive, for veterans, for those with significant medical conditions: please reopen the government. You are hurting these people. They are your people Mr. President.
The problem is...Democrats do not give a damn about this country.  Could care less if criminals and drugs come in through the border.  Could care less if Iran got nukes.  Could care less about the economy.  Could care less if America gets screwed in Trade Deals.  Could care less about expanding America's horizons such as space or energy independence.    No, Democrats dont work to make the US great.  That's the last thing on their minds.    Democrats work 100% of the time...to get power or hold on to power.   And the money and perks that come with it.

Linda Sarsour is a Bad Omen for America. This person is a liar, an enemy of the United States and Israel! It will have to be EXPULTED. We are afraid for your safety.  Jan 19, 2019 8:00 am By Rami Dabbas - 30 Comments  Every day more secrets are revealed about the Muslim Brotherhood and the State of Qatar, which stands behind the Muslim Brotherhood and supports it financially and morally through several tools and institutions, both inside Arab countries and in the West, especially in the United States of America, under the cover of the charities and NGO organizations located in those countries.  Linda Sarsour is an Arab American of Palestinian origin and executive director of the New York-based Arab American Society, an association that is administratively linked to the Qatar Foundation International and ideologically follows the Muslim Brotherhood and Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi – a terror promoter — who strongly supports the terrorist Hamas movement and the Qatari government, which is allied with adherents of political Islam. The Qatar Foundation International is closely linked to the Qatari government. Former US Treasury Department analyst Jonathan Schanzer describes the institution as “an ATM for the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliated groups, the spiritual father of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, as well as funding Hamas and terror groups in Syria.” Schanzer stressed that Qatar’s neighbors from Arab countries were “nauseated” by Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Qatar Foundation and the Emir of Qatar established the Al-Qaradawi Research Center in honor of Qaradawi. The purpose of the Center was to promote Al-Qaradawi’s ideas on the basis that he was a pioneer of moderate Islamic thought for Muslims today. In January 2012, the Qatar Foundation (QF) opened a center for Islamic legislation and advocacy. Tariq Ramadan, the grandson of the Brotherhood’s founder Hassan al-Banna and the son of Brotherhood leader Saeed Ramadan, was appointed as the director of research of the center.  At the same time, the Qatar Foundation has strong ties to the International Institute of Islamic Thought, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States that was investigated on terror finance issues after the 9/11 attacks. The deputy director of the Qatar Foundation for Islamic Legislation and Advocacy was Jasser Odeh. At the same time, he taught and lectured at the International Institute of Islamic Thought, as he mentioned in his own profile. The Muslim Brotherhood in the United States described the International Institute of Islamic Thought as one of “our organizations and institutions owned by our friends” in a secret memo issued in 1991. The memo states that the purpose of its network in the United States is “a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destructing Western civilization from within.”  Now we come back to Linda Sarsour, who also has suspicious personal relationships. In 2004, Sarsour told the press that the US authorities questioned her and her Palestinian husband Maher Judeh, who was threatened with deportation after living in the United States for seven years. In the same interview, Sarsour mentioned that one of her cousins spent 25 years in prison in Israel, and that a family friend was sentenced to 99 years in prison. She added that her unmarried brother was also serving a 12-month sentence for being a member of Hamas.  The New York Police Department opened an investigation into the relationships of the Arab-American Association, headed by Linda Sarsour, and tried to obtain information about its board members. It found that its chairman was Dr. Ahmed Jaber, head of the Dawood mosque, known as the Islamic Mission in America. Sarsour is constantly trying to portray law enforcement officials and the government as unfair to Muslims, and her claims and fears of terrorist plots are in fact government conspiracies, according to Sarsour.  For example, Sarsour said that New York police detectives fabricated terror cases so they could get funding for the New York Police Department. The government stopped an al-Qaeda plot to destroy an aircraft using an explosive device hidden in a person’s underwear: Sarsour claimed the attacker was actually a CIA agent. In an interview, Sarsour said that “fear of Islam” is merely a manifestation of American persecution of minorities, and the United States remains a democratic state with an authoritarian element. Sarsour is known to launch fierce attacks on Muslim Brotherhood opponents, including Muslim dissidents themselves, so the Qatar-affiliated Brotherhood put its money in the right place when it decided to invest in her organization.
coming from a retard that thinks because it's snowing climate change is not real , i can't believe people think you are some kind of genius , when in reality you're a moron with money , and it's daddies money or is it Russian money , i forget you lose it that fast
You are a terrorist
We don’t want a wall. Join the modern age. Walls are useless
Mr President, I don't think a failed criminal of a coward, such as yourself, is capable of protecting me, an american citizen.  You have appointed people unqualified to positions in your government. Other positions, you've left completely vacant.  You can't embezzle money as well as your criminal father.  You can't even lie to save your presidency.  You are a coward, Mr President, and to me the name "Trump" will forever mean villany and corruption.

Facebook must be dealt with severely. Facebook, cease to be a private organization when it became a monopoly, when it broke antitrust laws, and when it began from its Inception to promote a political leftist ideology, while discriminating against conservatives. Facebook has been a George Orwellian farm being used to program the minds of leftist people to their, FB's, Progressive agenda, Facebook's prevents should have an equal Level Playing ground for conservatives, as they are discriminate against daily.  Facebook has allowed its social media police 2 propagate and promote leftism oh, and radically Left ideologies. On the other hand, Facebook has discriminated against conservatives an often kick them off to silencer opinions, and intellectual voices. Facebook as any leftist fears the truth oh, and they don't want other people to hear the truth. Truth to the left and Facebook is like Kryptonite is to Superman
Well trump...you didn't fix snything...and fuker up just about everything...shithead
2. Day 731 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency - Halfway Point) - SICK! The VP of USA Mike Pence comparing Donald J Trump to Martin Luther King. That is SICK! REMINDER - Mike Pence has the same ideology as ISIS. Mike Pence would be throwing gay people off the top of a building in the name of Jesus Christ if he could get away with it (We have laws). REMINDER - Mike Pence is just as wretched & vile as Donald J Trump.   https://www.rawstory.com/2019/01/eve-mlk-day-pence-says-trump-like-martin-luther-king-jr-inspiring-us-border-wall/
I want Trump to shove the wall down all the Democrats throats just like Obama and the other evil San Fran Nan shoved Obamacare down ours!!!
We have to many illegals in our country. Working low qualification/manual labor jobs citizens could be working. Theyre hired because theyll work for less. This depresses wages in the entire area if high pops of them reside there. They get any type aid the state/county offers the same way they fraudulently get jobs, using stolen identities. These programs were meant for citizens truly in need. Not illegals here adding it in to their income. This needs to stop.  #deportallillegals
You moron!
shut the border down nothing crosses build the wall
🔴🔴CRISIS ALERT: 🔴🔴 Annual cost of illegal immigration is the crisis: OVER $84 BILLION. Yet Democrats will NOT spend 5 BILLION to keep Americans safe & stop drugs. Wake up Taxpayers! #BuildTheWall 🇺🇸

Open the Government, you greedy, selfish, childish little GOP bastards.
Our tax dollars go to fix infrastructure and walls in other countries, but not here in America.  Build the wall and fix our infrastructure.
A million vehicles pass the border everyday raise the fee from 44 to 46 dollars the extra 2 dollars at around 700 million per year can pay for and maintain the wall..enough bullshit already that cunt wants to resist at all costs..Pelosi skeleton bitch
Illegals are killing 12 Americans daily and they are not stopping to ask are you Democrats, Republicans, conservative or liberals..This is why I don't understand why anyone would be against adding a strong wall to stop these killers
That kid taunting the Native American with that MAGA hat is quickly becoming a steadfast symbol of hate in America. You can’t spell “hatred” without “red hat”
It is interesting to me that there are 23 million Trump followers and only 4 thousand comments on this thread screaming for a wall and some how you think you are the majority or that this is what people want... it's not!  The majority of people recognize that 3 years of DACA in exchange for 5 billion for a wall (which is grossly underbudget to complete, estimates are upwards of 30+ billion BTW) makes about as much sense as pissing in the wind... they only reason he made this offer is because it is a meaningless gesture that he thinks he can use to paint democrats as not caring about Dreamers.... he is the one that unilaterally dismantled the program.  SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP MR PRESIDENT.  We aren't as stupid as you are.
Melania is trumps main bitch
Democrats have become a socialist party. They no longer care about Americans. Democrats want power in order to stay in power they need illegals votes even tho they shouldn’t vote or get social security, or welfare they do.
BLAME THE TRAITOR DEMOCRATS FOR FIRST FAVORING AND PROTECTING ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH A SANCTUARY STATE LAW. NOW ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CAN COMFORTABLY DO A CRIME.

You are a liar
Idiot
Most of the people that are bitching about the cost of border security don’t pay taxes anyway. They either don’t work, they get everything they paid back on their tax return, or they are just low life thieves who go around stealing from others.
Why don't you crack down on the American employers that employ illegal immigrants. If there are less jobs in America for illegal immigrants than they won't want to come here .    a wall is a stupid idea.
POTUS;   At least you speak crap only and not write it.   Would take me an ETERNITY and SOME to see all  YOUR MINIONS' POSTS. Their LAZY-AMERICAN-WAY of writing ENGLISH is DESPICABLE.   "I AM" going to see you sooner than later HATER.   In the name of LOVE, "I AM" COMING PERVERT.  P.S.        A MEXICAN can write better ENGLISH; that is not surprising at all.  "I AM" "Always and forever" Omar Martinez

Your promises, Mr. President,  do not make things better for Americans....only worse.  We have people lining up at food banks so their families get a decent meal, people have no money for gas for their cars, you have no idea how wrong you have been against our citizens....the pain and suffering they are experiencing is YOUR FAULT and not the Democrats. Own up to it and stop your vindictive behavior to all of us.  Your poor little rich guy attitude is disgusting and will be your downfall eventually, at the voting booth.

Look at the influx coming in and we can't find jobs for our children coming out of school. Too many pushing our system and they know they can get free money if allowed to stay. Then they send it back ,tax free to their country. Bank of America and Wal-Mart helps them do it too.
Such a very low, dirtball approach to getting what you want, Comrade Cry-baby! As always, you suck. Go directly to jail!
If he wants to stop all the drug trafficking and all these drugs that day busted all that money that they show that They confiscated why they do not use all of that money toward the wall a lot of money they show that they got from Chapo why don't they use that money as well we as American shouldn't have to deal with the price of building it
Never. Lier

Don’t give in Mr. President.  No $5.7 B, no deal.  This is 100% on the left.  Pelosi and Schumer are only the head of the snake.  Maxine and Schiff are the tail.  Everyone in the middle are still snakes.  Worthless Republicans aren’t much better.  The Swamp deepens.
My neighbor was killed by a white male with an AK automatic weapon. In fact so many more have been killed with assault rifles that trump and the GOP are ignoring the REAL security crisis.

The wall is a symbol of fighting against socialism ... don't let drunk pelosi & nasty shumer ruin our wonderful country ... Build The Wall!!!
So dumbass's late night tweet storm was a gem, literally threatened the safety of 11 million people if his tantrum goes unanswered. This is exactly how fascism starts. Enjoy your dictator and traitor in chief, and wait til youd next on his purge
When you finally declare an emergency!   Build the wall. We need to bury barbed wire fence and other damaging materials all under the ground near the wall to also keep the illegals from tunneling
So why are you wasting time negotiating with the devil?  Get it done!  Your base didn’t elect you to meet the lunatic left halfway to hell!  They are going to bitch no matter what you do, so let’s quit waiting.  The wall needs done now and need to focus on healthcare reform, people paying way too much for crap policies!
Trump should have a sit down with El Chappo. He would perhaps find it educational except Trump would likely “fall in love” with him as he did Kim Jong Il. It’s always the worst of the worst who impress Trump the most.
Keep standing strong, get the wall built!!  Thank you.  The democrats r so desperate to stop it cuz they know they got nothing of real value to offer voters, and they can only keep themselves in power by buying illegals’ votes by giving them free stuff with taxpayers’ money
Build the wall and MAGA!!! Drain the swamp and lock them up!! Thank you, Mr. President!
I pledge to speak up about your absurdities and bullshit until you quit, are impeached, imprisoned or gone some other way. You trump, are a ridiculous human, a clear and present danger to all and a fucking fool.

****Think about This!!**** When Trump was originally going to run for office people told him to bring up immigration reform.  They felt it would be a good campaign platform to run on.   But he kept forgetting it so they told him to use the words “Build a Wall” because it’ll help you remember immigration reform.  He liked it so much that he decided to start spewing those words at every rally he had and that became his campaign slogan.  Pretty sure he was never really intending to actually build a wall.  Oh Look a fucking unicorn, meaning a made up thing that turned into him suddenly building a wall!!      Ask your self this question.   If Trump and the Republicans had actually wanted to build a wall, why didn’t they do it while they were in full control of all three branches of our government??   Obviously they didn’t need the Democrats help to do it.   They did the supposed tax cuts which was not popular with the Democrats due to it giving tax breaks for the richest people,  if they could do that then why couldn’t they do that with the wall??   Oh wait that’s because it didn’t really matter to Trump, and the Republicans in office didn’t want the wall!!    The Republicans  in office all sat on their ass and did nothing about the wall!!!  Blame Trump and your party, They had full control of our government and they squandered their chance away to build it if they really wanted it!!    Trump own this shutdown he has caused  and he is doing damage to our people and country all for a lie he created!!
Curtis Rudisail not sure whether you really don't know or you are trying to be a smart ellic. I will accept it as the first one. It is someone who has a family member, most often child killed by an illegal immigrant. Most of the time it is not the first time the illegal immigrant has committed crimes before besides being here illegally.
There is no doubt that Pelosi will reject the President's latest offer. That being the case I would:   Immediately proclaim a national crisis and get the military building barriers.  Secondly, I would let ICE loose. By that I would have them raid thousands of businesses and immediately deport any illegals found. As a nice measure I would give a 1 week notice that these raids are about to begin. Thirdly, along with deportation I would arrest either the hiring HR director, or if no one fits that description, arrest the front line supervision for hiring illegals.   Lastly, I would implement a 25% fee on ANY monies wired to Mexico and Central America.   If the President would implement a get tough program I would guess Pelosi would come begging to finally get this immigration issue solved once and for all. This crap needs to end.
Make now the LAST STEP on your way to Suicide, Dumb TRUMP !! FU !!!
Wall or no wall trump is crazy fool of hate
MR TRUMP man, you should stop fighting for ur “wall.. find another way,cause it’s not going to be money well spent anyways. Get a gun hun. your about to make the poorer poorer. And keeping the govt shut down is very stupid,people need jobs and babies need food. No one should live off gov’t assist,but for the ppl who work & can’t make ends meet,they need that lil help.  OPEN THE GOVT  while you argue about your bill to be passed for your wall, no need to hurt other ppl cause you aren’t getting what u want. Be a president not a baby!

You need to fix the Irs problem as well! Immigrants getting thousands of dollars in returns for claiming children not even in the us is ridiculous!
You are a liar and a fascist. We don't want your wall for a fictional crisis, we don't even want you as president.
Do you know how many AMERICAN BORN KILLERS ARE SITTING ON DEATH ROW EATING THREE MEALS A DAY GETTING MEDICAL ATTENTION.  You will not save this country with a wall period.  DONALD TRUMP "FOLLOWERS" OPEN YOUR EYES AND WIPE YOUR OWN ASS AND THINK FOR YOURSELF AND YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY AMERICANS ARE, ARE CURRENTLY, SUFFERING NOW OVER A WALL. THE HUMAN TRAFFIC SCANDAL IN ARIZONA ALLLLLLLLL AMERICAN BORN POLITICIANS!!! CRIMINALS COME IN ALL NATIONALITIES AND THE BIGGEST CRIMINAL OF ALL IS IN CHARGE OF THIS COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T CARE WHO HE STEPS ONNNNN!! NOT OVER ON!! This is a political statement.  This wall is the most ridiculous thing ever.  "Followers" who can't wipe their own ass and who are waiting on Donald Trump to tell them when to jump and how high voted for this terrorist because they can't think for themselves.  DONALD TRUMP is a TERRORIST: a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
Please stop listening to anyone but God and yourself!  Hold the line!!  I know they are hammering you but they always have.  Democcults want our nation overrun with criminals and drugs.  Start looking for the money and bank accounts they keep it in for selling our nation and our citizens out and then return it to the American Taxpayers they stole it from!
Kim Nielsen STFU and learn English you window licking idiot!!
IDIOT all this BULLSHIT from you i lie and lie and lie, you are really ill i youre head, and im so sad that there are so many sick Americans who are voting for you, they have apparently forgotten that the United States arose because of immigrants, even your own wife is not real American, so you are so far out. Is your wife also a criminal and a drug addict, just like anybody you mention now, maybe she is since she is married to someone like you
The FINGER POINTER! ...As Usual, playing the "Blame-Game" on others for YOUR OWN Nasty & Vile actions! ...STARVING America & Holding Us HOSTAGE For YOUR OWN Dark Purposes Is NOT Okay! #LockHimUp #ImpeachTrump #NotMyPresident
Mr. President:  The demand by Democrats that you re-open the government BEFORE negotiations begin on securing the border is a TRAP!  Don't trust them, Sir.  You MUST get funding for the wall before re-opening.  The monkey is on their back, now.
You are ignoring those killed by home grown white supremacy who killed more Americans than any other group.  Only 1% of crime is committed by illegal Immigrants.  Manipulating the statistics is evil and wrong.
Then stop talking about it and just Do it! Declare the Emergency, put up the wall and increase border safety and shove it up Nancy's senile nose....
How about parents of the children killed at Parkland? Or any of the other mass shootings?   Illegal immigration is at an all time low. Mass school shootings at an all time high. Kids have to grow up practicing active shooter drills. Any Republican that pretends that the wall is for the safety of kids, but in the same time does nothing for the safety of children gunned down in mass shootings is nothing more but a hypocrite.
Hey pussy-grab, if you really believe undocumented immigrants are so dangerous, why do you keep hiring them at your hotels and resorts?

It is so disgusting and embarrassing that the USA has a PROPAGANDA STATION! Who pays for this PROPAGANDA STATION? Who pays the daughter in law's salary?
The fact that some undocumented immigrants have committed violent crimes is no justification for demonizing all undocumented immigrants, anymore than the fact that some American citizens commit violent crimes is justification for demonizing all Americans.  Besides, your simpleminded solution of a wall won't eliminate the bulk of undocumented immigrants.  https://www.npr.org/2019/01/16/686056668/for-seventh-consecutive-year-visa-overstays-exceeded-illegal-border-crossings
Americans now issue new compromise proposal.  Screw the Democrats.  No Amnesty.  Have the Military START BUILDING THE WALL, but do not announce it.  We don't give a damn about what the Democrat criminals say.  Build a WALL, not steel slats.  Keep the government shut!  Do not let the pressure off of the Democrat criminals. Start deporting the 11 million ILLEGAL ALIENS brought in through no fault of the American people.  And by the way, its more like 35 million, not 11 million.  This is our final offer.  The next step is to put Chuck and Nancy in prison in Guantanimo.
How about the AMERICANS you put out of work! You want them to do a job for FREE! If it was me I'd walk in and be like your a fucking joke and a pos. You'd take it like the bitch you are
Donald, shove your wall up your arse!  Glenn
Contact Senator Kaine....Phone: (202) 224-4024 Senator Kaine, I heard you speak on the floor (1/18/19) how you empathize with the Government employees who are not receiving their paychecks. How a woman with a small baby was in tears as she missed her baby because her mother in another state had to baby sit her baby since she couldn't pay for day care while not receiving her govt pay. How moving it was to hear that mother's pain. Yet, what is more moving is the pain that Americans have been forced to feel every moment of every day because an Illegal has killed their loved one. So many American mothers miss their children whom they will NEVER see again because they were murdered by an illegal. The pain that Millions of Americans experience because an illegal has maimed them, raped them, attacked, harassed, stolen their ID, their property, their quality of life. I believe the pain of these Americans, at the hands of illegals, far exceeds the temporary "pain" expressed by those who aren't getting a paycheck as our President fights for ALL Americans by securing our border. Our President fights for ALL Americans, while you continue to fight for illegals and only a few Americans during this shut down. Fund the wall, build the wall, and fight for U.S ALL!  Respectfully,  Ms dawncee
I do not agree with one party or another 100%. No one should. Sadly, people just align with one side or the other despite any logic or critical thinking concerning all of the issues we face. Face the Nation and other credible shows can help broadcast what makes sense for the USA. I did not catch her name but a politician stated today that if we all invested a percentage of our income in health care coverage like we do with SS, we could help solve the health care issue. I totally agree with this and have stated it myself. The key issue is that all or MOST people need to be investing in it. The amount of people getting free health care for them and their ever growing families while on welfare, have increased health care costs. In addition, the amount if people getting SSI for themselves and for their kids (for just about any reason under the sun) is robbing hard working individuals of their financial futures. Why is this allowed? Why do so many welfare recipients continue to have baby after baby while on welfare, getting free everything, raises, free food, health care, housing then get SSI checks for their kids? This lack of requirement for so many to NOT be productive citizens is atrocious. Require people to contribute! And making sure all get health care for a fair percentage of their income is a logical idea as long as all able bodied people contribute! We can not allow open borders until welfare and SSI are revised!
You are the swamp. Give it up, Fatty. The majority of America is against you and your cronies.
sad democrats would rather destroy our country rather than have President Trump help U.S.A Citizens.  Amazing the praise muslim hussein received while taking our rights away.  Now we pay two cops 24/7 to block muslim hussein's street at both ends, even though he has built a wall around his house.  Didn't he tell you that?, while he condemns our President, for wanting to protect us.  Anyone that does not want the wall, please remove all locks and fences and walls from YOU house..  Open boarder Open your home.   idiots.
You’re an idiot
build the wall most important i even saw iris kids say brexit they like it.  your father in law is for the people he will get re elected stay with the base. that is why like him he knows what democracy is  look after your own people first you cannot look after the world.  yes angel families must speak more for their family sake. i heard cher and her son where letting refugees come live with her hiding them closets when ice came in. now my husband said cher on his side. movie stars should not be speaking out against trump makes us people dislike them like carrie underwood. like madonna saying she wanted to kill trump  that is awful thing to do or say . your father in law is good man needs protection
This is an open and public letter to the duly elected president Donald J Trump, from William Sharpe, citizen of the United States of America.  Dear Mr. Pres. you are in a very unique position as president of the United States, whereas only three other presidents have been placed into this position throughout the history of our nation, James Madison, Abraham Lincoln, and John F. Kennedy, two of the three were assassinated as you well know.  James Madison was fighting for the survival of our nation during the war of 1812, Abraham Lincoln was fighting for the survival of our nation, through the Civil war of 1860,  and John F. Kennedy was assassinated before he could fight and save America from the same foes, that the formal two presidents and yourself know so well.  Mr. Pres. you are in a unique position to be in a minority of great presidents and great leaders, and your challenges are no less than the challenges that these president faced, and probably because of technology today your challenges may be greater.  Mr. Pres. we are at the pinnacle as a nation for survival, I don't think anyone needs to tell you this, but I will tell you that a majority of the American people stand behind you,, and are willing to sacrifice all to defend this nation from the tyranny coming from the Democratic party.  Mr. Pres. if we do not stop them here and now, we the American people will be forced into a unCivil War, and that is what these individuals want.  I would ask you to use the power granted to you by the office, to take these individuals involved in the destruction of our nation's Constitution laws our heritage our liberties and freedoms, into custody for trial as domestic terrorist, plotting the overthrow and destruction of the United States of America.  If we the people, common men like myself understand these things to be true and factual, we cannot wait any longer for our nation to be eroded away to be the equal of some substandard nation of crime and larceny.  The American people did not sacrifice their lives in all the battles and wars to defend this Republic to let it be taken away by pedophile, serial killers, rapist.and murderers, and we the people are ready and willing to stand with you and fellow countrymen to stop the destruction of our nation!  If we take these individuals in for trial now, we will have stopped the next violent Civil War in America!  Their public statements and actions prove without a shadow of a doubt that they stand against the American people, and have larceny and ill will in their heart for the will and safety of the American people.  Sincerely citizen William Sharpe of Delaware.
She won’t listen, she is brain dead
You’re a lying fraud and a coward.  You don’t care about America. If you did you wouldn’t have done the Russian Treason.  Hiding behind families.  Propaganda from Putin’s little puppet!

Trump is not holding federal employees as ransom.  illegal people should take the 3 years and then apply like all the legal immigrants had to do.  Why should the illegal people get free education, free housing, free food stamps, free health care and then brag on social media that they never worked a day in America?  Trump is exposing what has been going on for years.  The legal Americans should be getting some of these free programs.  Instead legal Americans are coming out of college with big student loans and debt WHILE the illegals DACA are coming out with $0 debt and loan.  Enough already.  Let President Trump do his job.

United States does not negotiate with terrorism.  Donald Trump is a terrorist holding this country hostage for f $5.7 billion.  Don’t give in to this motherfuckers demands.
I dont thank God for him but rather pray that God would get this turd ball out of office as this country was and will always be known as the melting pot country and Donald Duck Trump sure knows how to perfect the temper tantrum and truely is making a mockery of our country's political system . It's bad enough he threw a temper tantrum when the vice president took his bouncy ball away from him I could just imagine what's gonna happen when he gets his official eviction notice from the white house. And I also pray the courts take his properties away from him as he needs no power to return as he is trying to create a situation that will bring about martial law and put all of these wal mart stores that have been converted to holding centers into active status and this God for saken wall that he is pushing to build is gonna do one thing and that's lock us in and imprison us supposedly free Americans that are working so hard for him to take our tax money and play a brain game with it just the same as he did with his fake bankruptcy filing to get 2 trump towers in New York City. So please people look at the TRUE facts not fiction before you go supporting a liar , a cheater , and a thief.
We do want save boarders, but spending g money on a wall will not keep the terrorists out. In case no one has mentioned it, we welcome legal migration here in the US. Fix the system. Hire more people. People will come here legally if the system is safe, efficient, and effective. We need workers!
Donald Trump is guilty of treason.
Gail Church a little proof reading might help some of us to believe your babble.........nahhhhh
But not at your expense, holding the American people hostage is not making America great again. Leave my people alone. Pay the federal workers, stop playing Hilter, I am tired of your lying, cheating ass. You are an humiliation and a joke. Honorable men don't hold families hostage

You're stupid and donkey.
President Trump knew they would reject his proposal....he is showing the Latinos ...(he was already up 19 poll points by Latinos before the speech) that the Dems aren’t there for them. Like he is showing Black American they have been fooled by the Dems for decades. Just give him a chance. He knew that he was going to use the military all along to build the wall. This is all to expose the Dems corruption. He had to wait for 30 day shutdown to get rid of deep state DEMS WORKING in the Government that he couldn’t fire. Now under RIF he can. I bet he brings back only half of the 800,000 that have been laid off. And Obama brought Muslim Brotherhood into the Government that Trump couldn’t get rid of. Just trust Trump he is smarter than you think. He is exposing the Dems and the Media to the American people about how corrupt they are. Just relax it will turn out ok. Just take a breath.
President Trump 20172025 I believe  most Americans  wish you  will suggest that the Despicable democrats fire bitch pelosi and  put a speaker in  who will put  Americans first,  We also want a balanced budget clause and  the elimination of the  discretionary spending clause,  no more cr' s  we also want  a smaller government and  cuts in spending, in order to reduce the Despicable debt dramatically so America's children and grandchildren  are not slaves to the debt , Tomorrow  hopefully will begin the firing of government employees:  ( the worthless incompetent government  employees)  We all are grateful and thank God you are President : 2 years since you took the oath of office.  Yay,  ;)  Thank You God's speed and God bless America and your family
Just shoot a few dozen and we wont need a wall
🎼Don't back down🎶 🎧Stand your ground🎶 We pay taxes for protection and we demand and deserve it. ✅Thank's a lot Democrats,Hollywood and bias media.✅I'm sure everyone knows some one who over dosed on fentanyl lace heroine.It's killing Americans and 90 % of it comes over the southern border and so does 75% of the heroine. Think about that every time you stick up for the Democrats.Build the wall or let more kids die,plain and simple.
Came in to be a nude model. Then you brought her parents in. Tell me trumpy 🐷, what makes them better then the poor people trying to get to the U.S..  You are disgusting. 😉
Build the wall. Deport them ALL, with a democrat under each arm.
We need to re-brand Mr. Fibb's slogan of "Make America Great Again" into "Hugs from Thugs"... Admittedly,he will sell out the will of the majority of country for $5.7B....take hostage a whole level of or workforce and not even mention them, create crisis and then take credit for fixing the crisis, and he will sell us out abroad... All it takes is an admiration letter or say you admire him. Aren't you glad you don't live in a dictator country where they can make you disappear, execute you, or starve you to death, deny you your legal rights??? America help feed those that are unpaid, unable to go to work population and thrive.. don't let the hostages suffer..give all you can, if you can..
And they come in holding their flag....how crazy is that.....stay and fight for your country.......democrats are to blame because of they are promissing all free living.......all paid by us.......our president is 100% right......not fair to american to have to support all illegals.....some gangs....killers.....money is so needed here !

Actually he made a couple of promises  Hes having problems with the wall An the deep state an left's are keeping him so busy putting out fires that he has forgot the one promise he made he can do  Make everything declassified on all of the  Deep state and the dems  He may not win the next election but he will go down in history as the man who really cleaned up Washington  An that includes the dems sending  That's wat he should go for Forget the cat an mouse games  They want that  Go big or go home mate  Clean up Washington an you will go down in history forever You dont need to do 2 terms  Try telling the people  That u may not be able to give them all you promised because of the obstructionist but you can get rid of the swamp  Do it  Do it now
A wall won’t work AND it will take at least 15 years to build and no less than $25 BILLION.  Prevention by fining those that house and hire illegals (your resorts might be fined though). No birthright for babies of non citizens. Rescind financial aid to these countries that continue to allow this. Why send our money there if they are just going to send their folks here? Why are we being held hostage for a wall instead of the talks happening with leaders of Mexico, Guatemala, or wherever these folks come from? WE should not have to deal with this due to greedy employers, American drug users, and egos from Washington!
Democrats hate so much President Trump that they do not see how stupid they look and sound when using the same words like they have been given order what to say...this is a communist tactic .Adults that claim that are educated but do not understand that border security  is a complicated issue ...but before everything  else you have to have a barrier to establish where will be a port of entry. Democrats want open border and like illegals and ignore American citizens...They want to open the government and than discuss border security....are they serious about it ?????. They had 4 weeks to discuss ....did they ???....With this being said we the people have to support our president.....
What are you going to do about the illegals using their ITEN numbers and filing tax returns, using their children back in Mexico as deductions!!!! It's costing billions of dollars of Americans tax money for their illegal refunds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Open the government back up you dick biter
Don the Con is the worst president ever. Not even a POTUS, just a little, impotent, POS!
What does that have to do with hurting 800,000 of your own employees. Stop this insanity. What a moron.
Sigh, how many times to we have to tell you, the wall is not going to stop terrorists or drug smuggling!  According to Justice Department public records, no immigrant has been arrested at the southwest border on terrorism charges in recent years.   And most drugs are smuggled into the United States onboard fishing boats, trains, tractor-trailers and ordinary cars that come into the country at legal ports of entry. The wall won't stop any of this.  The wall is a scam and a distraction!

President TRUM P you have the power to put these Hypocrites Wicked Devil Worshipping Witches & Warlocks in Prison for multitude of murders, kidnapping & selling children & adults into slavery.... Why aren’t they Arrested & Locked up? A dog can pee on the side walk but if I did they’d lock me up & these people get away with murder, rape, & crimes so unspeakable they defy ones imagination. I speak to you devils in Jesus name you will not succeed in your plots & plans! You will fail & fall into the holes you dig for others! AMEN. PUT them in PRISON where they belong where they cannot do any more harm to PEOPLE! 🧐
You're likely going to need to call a State of Emergency to get the wall funding, Mr. Trump. These Democrats are nothing but obstructionists and subversives, who care not one iota about America or the American People. They care about getting back in power, period, and they see a huge influx of illegals in here as undocumented future Democrat voters. They scream about Voter IDs, borders, they want sanctuary cities around the country - their agenda is obvious. #BuildTheWall
TRUMP IS, "INDIVIDUAL 1" and implicated in 2 felonies in court documents. BEWARE the Trump Low life cheesy lying UnAMERICAN crime family.  MORE MANAFORT INFORMATION WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL. Michael Cohan has set date to testify in congress in open session. 😂 Grab your popcorn, Walnuts 😂  Trump has been being investigated since before inauguration by the counterintelligence division of the FBI (ongoing).  Allen Weisselberg and David Pecker have given up all they know including videotapes and documents about all his filthy dirty dealings.
Keep sucking trump Fox News
Tired of all this Collusion questions.  President Trump said himself  "I have never been more insulted by any question or statement "   well I really have to disagree I think Stormy Daniels said worse " He has a mushroom for a dick"  so it's toss up.  I don't understand why they make a big deal that DJT has met with Putin 5 times already and many times in private again I am less concerned with Collusion than I am of Penetration !!!  Putin has to be the pitching and Trump the catcher !!   Firm believer for a wall as it will get people working and there should be no interference from immigrants as they just entered Arizona via a Tunnel found too late.  I know the President is doing his best to end the Shut Down but Melania won't budge as she got on a military plane to Mar Lago  good for her.  Let's hang in there and continue to support the President, for me getting together with neighbors today to go down the Coast Guard Food Pantry setup so these kids and families can eat and save what they have saved for rent  elec etc.   After all these are the people that save lives at sea and confiscate most of the drugs trying to get into USA.  The same people who actually MAKE AMERICA GREAT.   MAGA !
Nancy you dumb fucking cunt built the mother fucking wall
That batshit crazy woman won’t speak with Angel families because the left side hates the truth. I’m sure that with her acting like a bitch to these families, it will be more votes for Trump for 2020.

To visi protecting illegals and criminals and stealing taxpayers money
I want Pelosi on a stick. We don't always get what we want. That is a lesson that is hard for people to gbrasp. They have been coddled so much, even allowing men in dresses to pee with our children in public restrooms. Finally, a strong man who doesnt bend when folks don't like him. He doesn't care! He is not president to bend, break or hold you when you whine. He is more likely to whoop your ads and invite you to get up or get out. Its hard to be told no I guess. People has lost their moral compass. Pesident Trump is about leading with a firm hand.
We need illegals deported just as, if not more so than the wall.
Go the he’ll around these lowlife Dems quit playing games with our security build our wall now before a Democrap gets in office

The Dems have rejected your very generous offer. They now own this shutdown. Close the border indefinitely, including legal ports of entry.  Declare a National Emergency. It is not fair that illegals are jumping ahead of legal applicants to get into the U.S. , where they will be released. American taxpayers are tired of supporting illegals. Government-dependent illegals and refugees are going to collapse the economy of this country. That is the goal of Democrat Socialists and Globalists who are trying to implement NWO.
Nancy is a Fk Bitch send her ass to Mexico for ever
Hey here's an idea to pay for your damn border wall. How about you decriminalize marijuana and use the profits to fund the building. Instead of fucking over the American people with this shutdown
we want Pelosi to leave and take her useless democrats with her
What kind of evil cold blooded politicians can not feel the pain of so many moms and dads who have had children murdered by illegal immigrants. The kind of politician that I would not want representing me. Pelosi and Schummer could care less about anyone other than themselves they are both to vile to serve American citizens. People from California and New York should be very proud of Nancy and Chuck no one else is.
you need to SHUT DOWN your social media and go back to NY.
I never saw so much hate in my life for a President , that shows what the Democrats are! Vile ,liars , low ! so many families lost the loved ones ... committed by  Illegals,  and more millions more   want  to invade  to  our Country ,it is outrageous !
To all you libtard Dem morons out there — THE WALL = WINNING.  Got it? 🤪
President Trump is always two steps ahead of Pelosi & Schumer. Let's take five billion out of the Congress's pension fund -- like they did with our social security! Congress is useless anyway! 🎯💲💲🔴

Pelosi is one sorry ass individual.  She cares about no one in this country.  Pelosi is against a wall but the first thing you notice at her house is a wall with a gate.  Trump actually cares for the American citizens, unlike that useless whore.
Way to go, Mr. President, shining a flashlight on the cockroaches Pelosi and Schumer.  They don’t give a damn about Americans or DACA kids.  Greed, power and the votes.  They are exposed for the trash they are.  We see them!!!!!!

I feel for National security reasons , the speaker of the house needs to step down.  It is so obvious that they are just holding out until something happens so they can blame the President for the shutdown.  Someone, Vice President,must have the authority to force the speaker of the house to step down for national security ??  Open the government now, please.  “Even before Trump officially made his speech and put protections for young immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on the bargaining table, Democrats denounced the offer, saying it wasn't enough to end the historic shutdown.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Trump's proposal "unacceptable" and said it was a "non-starter" that wouldn't pass in Congress”.  The government shutdown is almost a month, maybe ask her what would be a starter?  Order her, speaker of the house, to stay at the negotiation table until a deal is made.  Cut her off from whoever is telling her what to do and have them sign a deal to open the government this week please.

THERE WILL BE MANY AMERICAN CRIMINALS...FORGET ABOUT THE MEXICANS...THIS WILL CREATE AMERICAN CRIMINALS...ALL YOU MUST BE RICH.....I VOTED FOR TRUMP REGRETFULLY.....THE POOR ARE COMING TO YOU....HOPE YOU RICH CATS ARE READY....
I don't believe Nancy Pelosi should even eat in office. She has proven that she is 100% Democrat doesn't care about our country and who voted her in or total idiots. Can't wait till vote again get rid of Nancy Pelosi
Nancy Pelosi will not meet with the Angel families that lost loved ones because of illegal immigrants because they do not fall into her delusional and misguided political agenda. It just shows how screwed up her and the democratic party are. They support illegals more than they support the American people. It is pretty pathetic.
THESE TAX PAYER TRIPS MUST STOP. YOU WANT TO TAKE A TRIP DO IT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, PAY FOR IT YOUR SELF. YOU WANT TO GO SEE YOUR GRANDMOTHER IN ANOTHER COUNTRY [MUSLIM CONGRESS WOMAN] FINE YOU PAY FOR IT. YOU WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH TERRORIST - DON'T COME BACK. EVERYONE WRITE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP THESE CONGRESS, SENATE AND SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE TAXPAYER TRIPS. THAT'S MONEY $THOUSANDS THAT COULD GO ON THE WALL AND HELP AMERICAN'S. STOP ALL THIS THE TAXPAYER PAYS FOR EVERYTHING. THEY GET PAID A SALARY. THEY CAN PAY THEIR OWN TRIPS, VACATION'S AND EXPENSES TO AND FROM WASHINGTON. TAX PAYER'S PAY FOR THE 1ST FAMILY ONLY. PASS IT ON. WRITE PRESIDENT TRUMPS FACEBOOK. THIS IS MONEY THEIR SPENDING FROM SOCIAL SECURITY THEY KEEP TAKING. PEOPLE DO SOMETHING,  HELP BUILD THE WALL.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT.

Here's an idea dumb dumb, crack down hard on those who employ undocumented immigrants, shut them down and send them to jail. Once the word gets out no one here will hire them they will stop coming and the 100's of thousands that fail to honor their visa commitments will leave. But then we will have to convince all your trumpkins to go to work
You are the devil
This President, has never stopped yet on making our country proud ! And as for you , Pelosi & Schumer, neither have you , at trying too destroy it ! I say , they need to go 😡so let’s start our own campaign, to rid our government of them 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏They NEED to go 😡😡😡😡

Do some research on your own and see how much has been donated to those countries over the last 20 years...that hasnt changed anything..only thing that would do anything is to go in by force and remove their goverment in a all out war...until people in those countries stand up to their own goverment nothing will change.. 80% of the worlds population according to the UN lives on less than 10 dollars a day...is it sad yes but we cant support the whole world
? People are fleeing their countries because they are afraid they are going to get raped or killed., right? Or to get a better job or education?  —why don’t the higher ups or leaders in those countries do their jobs! and make it a safe and prosperous place for their people to live!! Instead of building a wall...Use the money to make those countries civilized instead of acting like barbaric assholes!  I don’t get it. Enlighten me please.

And that is a surprise how? Pelosi is a Democrat. Quite simply, they don't care!
DACA is disappointing. First: We've had 7 amnesty programs since 1986. If ANYONE was had the opportunity at amnesty and didn't take it - then it should be off the table for them (for kids, I'd give it 2). Second: Anyone that has been here 5 years or less does not have ties to this country - they still have ties to their former country - deport them! So you are dealing with people from 2000-2013. Then ALL DACA applicants must be vetted - if they have committted ANY other crime - they are deported. Third: They should NEVER gain citizenship, a green card to allow them to stay maybe, but not citizenship. Breaking the  law should never be rewarded like that. Fourth: They should be ineligible for welfare. Fifth: Their ability to stay should not be the reason for parents, siblings, aunts, uncles to stay....it should not be a means to chain migration. We, as a country, need to send a strong message to the rest of the world - we welcome LEGAL immigrants, but if you come illegally you WILL BE deported!

We, as a country, need to send a strong message to the rest of the world - we welcome LEGAL immigrants, but if you come illegally you WILL BE deported!
CALL NATIONAL EMERGENCY, REMOVE ALL ILLEGALS FROM OUR COUNTRY AND STOP THROWING DEALS AT THE WITCH. GROW SOME BALLS PRES. TRUMP AND PUT NANCY IN HER PLACE ONCE AND FOR ALL.

PLEASE READ....VERY IMPORTANT!!!!I just saw a report from Corey Woods where illegal immigrants are filing tax claims on children who do not live here in the US. They are claiming multiple nieces and nephews that are out of the United States and have never lived here. We have to have social security numbers to claim our children. Why aren't they receiving a number for their children that they have in the United States for them to claim? Why do they not have to prove that a child lives here? The amount of money they are receiving on the child tax credit is insane and should be stopped and some kind of proof needs to be provided to show that that child lives here. 😖

Do work on immigration and border security AFTER restarting the government.  This crippling Trump/McConnell Shutdown is causing more harm than the few illegals you claim are criminals and drug dealers.  Shame on you and all who think that any wall is worth this chaos caused by your selfish unwillingness to compromise!

Hey nancy u dumb cunt BUILD THE WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!
Democrats. I’m tired of you telling me and the country lies about that the wall will not work. You say people will just dig under it. Well I say, the amount of people digging tunnels under the wall is going to be so minuscule to the amount of people it deters in the first place. Also the new wall I’m sure will be going down in the ground deep enough to discourage tunnels. It will also discourage people from making that very dangerous trip to our border. I’m tired of hearing about technology yet nobody says what kind of technology that you’re proposing. Is your technology going to stop them from stepping one foot on US soil, because if it doesn’t then we will be chasing them down and then they will be getting all the benefits & rights this country has to offer. It will also be adding to the all ready back log of 900,000 immigration court cases that are already pending. So if your technology it’s not stopping them from coming across the border in the first place then it’s just bullshittttt. Walls work, and walls are in 40 some plus countries used for protecting their borders. They are around prisons, the Vatican, the Facebook man and all the rich peoples houses.  Why do Democratic politicians have walls around their house ???  So I’m sick and tired of hearing you say walls don’t work. That’s bullshitttt, and all you liberals know is your Democratic talking points and they don’t make commonsense. Only a few years ago the Democrats voted for a wall, and there are plenty of videos to prove it.  It is only now they don’t want it because Trump campaigned on it, and it would be seen as a win for him, and Democrats can’t have that even though it makes our country safer. Democrats know that would hurt their re-election possibilities. Democrats only care about the votes that illegals can bring them. Ask yourself this question, if illegals voted for Republicans instead of Free Stuff Democrats, would that wall already been built by Democrats by now !!!!  😂😂😂. Democrats would love to take away our Second amendment constitutional right of bearing arms if it could only save just one life yet they turn a blind eye to the thousands and thousands of people that have died because of a unsecured border. Can you say hypocrites !! The truth is Democrats learned over the last decade that they gained 3 million new voters if they allow illegals to jump the border. Lets not be stupid here. At some point Democrats have to see the elephant in the room.!!!  Ps. They do see that elephant but they are telling us there is no elephant and yet people believe it because they have the News Media on their side. You might ask why then is the News Media on the Democrats side??  Easy, because the Media are 90% liberal. Open your eyes to what lies you are being told. By only watching one source of news you are self censoring yourself. Out of all the news going on in this world you only here 24/7 negative news on Trump. It is impossible for anyone to do that much wrong in a booming economy. The liberal media is taking us for suckers.  How much good could we be doing for our country if Democrats were on the side of the American people and working with Trump. We are all on the same team. We are not supposed to be two separate football teams fighting each other.  We should be like ONE Football team that has a offense and defense trying to win the game together. I can’t believe how half this country can’t see this.  Jack Schoch. Yes, I wrote this and I approve my message. I’m sick of this Crap.

It is sad when the president must fight for the rights of citizens over the rights of those who want to invade our country illegally!  Meanwhile the Democrats are more concerned with rights of illegals!  As a voting citizen, I expect my representatives to protect us and maintain law and order in our country.  The path to freedom was given to us by men and women who fought for us.  Those who want to come here need to come LEGALLY!

Mr President,  You’ve done an amazing job . But many things still need to be imploded. CAIR must be removed from these shores. They do not have any desire to coexist. Lastly, we must demand they either assimilate or leave. This religion is not one of peace. It is political ideology using a religion to slowly conquer a town, a state, a nation, the world. This is beyond debate.   Education in this country is a straight “build a Marxist sheep” program at every grade level. This is by far is your most important task and perhaps longest  lasting move to ensure the radical leftist globalist never drive the country into the toilet again.   I do trust the plan. I know that where we go one we go all. However, I do believe that many American loving  patriots will totally lose faith in you and our nation if the criminals are not brought to justice in a public and big way. How are we going to prevent American Politicians of the future from becoming Clinton/Obama criminals who hate and destroy America. We must have a visual Nuremberg - A watershed moment where traitors, child killers, and their ilk meet MAGA justice.  Deep state justice is a massive part of the MAGA patriot’s expectation.  Furthermore , pedophiles and child killers should be dealt with as prescribed by the Bible. A rope, a millstone, and a body of water. Those that would harm a child deserve the darkest justice our nation can offer.  You are a master level troll. I suggest you take it up a notch. Education debt is killing this country’s college graduates. Can you imagine how a college graduate’s life might change if they were informed that their eighty thousand debt was reduced to zero? Imagine what that might do for our economy.  But there’s a catch. They must donate two thousand dollars to the building and or maintainance of our southern border wall. If a person is unable to pay that amount then they can pay monthly for five months. Finally, every person who donates to the wall gets 5”x5” sign with their name. They also rescieve a photo of their sign on the wall and its precise mile location.  Many thanks and may God continue to bless and protect you.  Sincerely,  The Garners
She's a drunken coward
God bless these fallen heroes and their families, thank you from all Americans!!! This is a Manufactured, obstruction of the TRUMP presidency, this is tyranny, against us and our elected POTUS.

Why does Nancy and Chuck hate you so much to deny America its security?  When they approve the taking care of Illegals in the amount of what?  $138 Billion PER YEAR.  When All they have to do is do what AMERICA wants, that is build the wall, or should I say FINISH the wall for a one time price of $5 billion.  So why do nancy and chuck HATE America so much?
Two years ago, I was at the Inauguration of the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump. The train going into DC was delayed on the tracks. We were told that there was a problem ahead, but that it would be taken care of ASAP. I remembered how I had read of a threat from ANTIFA - that they would block the tracks leading to the Capital, and I wondered. Arriving at street level, all that could be seen were masses of people - lines upon lines of people - winding around every block and down every street, as far as the eye could see. The lines were incredibly slow. Each person had to go through tight security prior to entering the mall area. College age people kept trying to push their way through. I blocked many of them as I suspected who they were. A story filtered through the crowd that security checkpoints were being blocked by ANTIFA protesters. I realized that much of the ceremony might be missed by just staying in line and blocking ANTIFA one at a time, so I walked many blocks laterally to reenter the line close to an open checkpoint. Arriving on the Mall, the air was electric! People were ignited with joy! As President Trump spoke, the atmosphere itself changed, and the sun burned through the threatening sky. The spirit shifted. I'm not talking about what was happening in people's hearts. There was an actual change in the air - as if it had been cleansed and released. There was a palpable change in the spiritual authority over Washington. As soon as our new President was done speaking, I rushed to the parade route on Pennsylvania Avenue, only to be greeted by more security lines and checkpoints.  Blessedly, I got through in time, and was given an unexpected seat at the top of some bleachers. There was a great commotion about two blocks up, and there were DC police, military equipment, fire engines, helicopters, and Army personnel everywhere. It turned out that Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA were rioting only two blocks from where I was. The rioters and their supporters who were not apprehended, moved to the area next to our bleachers! They began chanting, yelling, and disrupting. I couldn't stand it! How dare they steal the joy of our day? I started answering each of their chants with a counter chant, and the rest of the people on the bleachers joined in! The Army presence increased around us and the police lining the street began to appear nervous. The rioters started chanting "Black lives matter", so we shouted them down with "Police lives matter". As we did that, the police relaxed and became friendly toward we, the bleacher people. The Army dispersed, and the protestors quieted. Unfortunately, President and Mrs. Trump did not walk past where we were. They rode by in the Beast. I'm sure our "battle" and the riot two blocks away caused that. As I watched his car drive past, I heard a warning. "The weapon that they will use against him, is to try and separate him from the people, to isolate him". How true that prophesy has been. Praise God, they have not succeeded. Thank you President Trump. May God go with you, and may you go with God.

‘Twas during the shutdown ….And the speaker of the house,  Tried to leave town ….quiet as a mouse.  Pelosi was packed … She was ready to go.  But Trump sent a letter,” I don't think so ...”  “You can't use my plane,” he said with Glee, “ You must stay here and negotiate with me !” She said “What nerve.  What gall!” Trump said: “Tough sh%@#! I'm getting my wall!!!”
We’re with you! Government employees can draw on their 401ks tax free during a shutdown and pay it back out of their back pay. Also they should plan for these shutdowns and have at least a 6 month nest egg saved. Keep it shut until immigration is FIXED! #CONGRESSDOYOURJOBS!
There's another Caravan coining 5,000 and behind that one there's another 7,000  when asked that they won't be allowed in the USA  just because they want a JOB THEIR ANSWER? WHOCARES..

President Trump you know you can not make a jackass budge.
I read all of the comments here and it makes me embarrassed to be a Republican... everyone is just name calling like our President. No wonder nothing gets done if this is the mentality of our party. I was hoping we would MAGA again but I am beginning to see that Trump is just a clown and a joke as are his supporters. I am embarrassed that I voted for this fool.  #TurningBlue
If this administration truly wanted to do something about immigration they would do something about the Dreamers and they would come up with some solutions for processing immigrants at the border. A huge wall is a waste of taxpayers money! Repair the fences that already exist first. Add more border control, drones, cameras, etc..

WHY IS THE OUR MONEY WRITTEN IN LATIN? WHY DOES IT HAVE THE YEAR THE ILLUMINATI WAS CREATED 1776. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. Donald J. Trump  I CHALLANGE YOU LOW IQ BUSINESS MEN.
Do not want the wall if Trump is going to give away our country to get it.   Pelosi and Schumer are working for illegal immigrants, DACAs, and the citizens of foreign countries. Nothing is on that negotiating table but our  Taxpayers' dollars and a welcome mat for all future invaders and breakers of our laws  at our expense.  It is obvious that our immigration laws mean nothing to those coming over our borders or to those who came over illegally in the past. Pelosi's and  Schumer's demands are excessive since they are representing non-citizens.  What is next?  Another amnesty like the one in 1985  that will only encourage further breaking of our laws and actually encourage illegal immigration?   Even if negotiations end, the barriers will not be put in place.  We are being controlled by  the bullying and demands of non-citizens.
The wall will do nothing you have to go to there tunnels and flush them out. The people coming to the wall are families and people trying to escape cartel.
REPUBLICANS DO NOT CARE about children’s BRAINS being splattered on a school chalkboard what makes you think they care about children being RIPPED FROM THEIR MOTHERS ARMS……Illegal immigrants do have limited rights; the right to a fair trial is one of them.This is A MINOR TRESPASSING CHARGE that they not yet even been convicted of and the IDIOT REPUBLICANS think you can KIDNAP THEIR CHILDREN Hold the children HOSTAGE in a TRUMP ORPHAN CAMP to pay for for A WALL that some other country was supposed to pay for… AND THEN LOCK THE PARENTS UP for life,,,,, for the first commission of any such offense, be fined under title 18 or imprisoned NOT MORE THAN 6 MONTHS,,, or both, TRUMP and JEFF SESSIONS have publicly stated that if TRUMP WERE TO GET HIS WALL the separation of the families would be stopped IF THAT IS NOT TERRORISM in its purest form tell me what is....  These kids are going to be SOLD through RELIGIOUS ORPHANAGES for a PRICE. Any idea what a healthy pre teen child goes for on the black market ? THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE A FORTUNE even if they had to pay for their room and board which YOU and I  are paying for as TAXPAYERS,,or WORSE they may be sold for BODY PARTS,,,
Pelosi needs to be tried for treason with all of her cronies...
Pelosi needs to be tried for treason with all of her cronies...
What happened to Mexico paying for your stupid monument to idiocy? And hey, what about your taxes? Asshole dotard fool.
Alright, let's clear some things up about this shutdown. My job literally requires me to monitor the government funding process, so let me explain what's happening here.   There are 12 spending bills that make up federal government funding. Five of the 12 were passed by the House and Senate last fall, but seven of the 12 were still pending (hence a partial shutdown).   Between October and December, key House and Senate offices met and negotiated details of the remaining 7 spending bills. When those details were worked out, they were ready to go. A two-week extension was agreed to (by both chambers) in early December to work out the final details.   In mid-December, the Senate took the first step and passed all  7 spending bills in a UNANIMOUS decision. That's right, unanimous. 100 - 0. All Republicans and Democrats voted in favor. The package gets sent to the House.  The government could have been funded here, at this very moment, had the House just passed the Senate's unanimously agreed-upon spending package. Shutdown completely avoided. But House Republicans chose not to do that.   Instead, right before the holiday break, the House decided to change the agreement (and add funding for the wall).  They passed an alternative spending package in a highly partisan vote, one that contained funding for the border wall.   So now the Senate and House have two different spending bills (that's not allowed, obviously). Government shuts down. The holiday break happens. January 3rd comes. And then we have a new session. Legislation resets.   Now read carefully because this point is very, very crucial.   Speaker Pelosi could have promoted a "liberal agenda" and advocated for a new spending package that completely gave Democrats everything they wanted. However, she chose to respect the Republican-led Senate's spending package from December. So she left 6 of the 7 spending bills the exact same, word-for-word, as they were in the Senate. Again, the Senate had unanimously voted in favor of these bills just a few  weeks prior.   The sole remaining spending bill was the one with the border wall funding. Speaker Pelosi simply issued a temporary extension on this bill so that the border wall funding could be debated without the government shutting down. Again, she didn't pass a spending bill that said "no funding for the wall". It was a temporary extension to work out the details and ensure negotiations didn't harm workers.   This solution would have, at the very least, kept most of the federal departments unrelated to the border wall open. It would also have kept DHS, TSA, etc., open throughout negotiations, at least until the extension deadline approached.   But Trump and Mitch McConnell are not letting this happen. They are advocating for all of these departments to remain shutdown (even departments that have NOTHING to do with the border).   Since then, Democrats in the House keep passing bill after bill to reopen the government, pay workers while the government is closed, etc. Mitch McConnell is not allowing any of these bills to come to the Senate. All because Trump told him to do that.   These men are monsters. And, by extension, if you support this, you are a monster. These families have become Trump's pawns. And they are suffering because of it.
"Trump Touts Border Wall In San Antonio, Which Has No Wall And Isn't On The Border" ... you're worshiping an idiot.
Require every illegal immigrant pay $500.  Multipy that by 11 million illegals thats $5.5 BILLION!  The wall gets paid for by the people of MEXICO living in OUR country!  In exchange they'll receive ONE YEAR SOVEREIGNTY in the US.  Share & visit www.paytostay.us TY!
It’s easier to tell Trump to end shutdown than to stand up to Tyranny and Tyrants. Get a backbone people. Our forefathers went through far worse to give us this country and you don’t want to be inconvenienced. Pack your kids lunches. Use your credit cards, do whatever it takes but don’t give in.

Mr. President, While I agree we DO need a good wall on the Southern border to help BP, the biggest issue with immigrants living here ILLEGALLY is the VISA OVERSTAYERS, that come in & refuse to leave when their time is up, they KNOW when they get that visa that it is a TEMPORARY VISIT but our Gov't has done NOTHING to them for violating U.S. Immigration LAWS! It's been a big problem for DECADES, it's not new & STILL in 2019 thee is no solution to this?? DACA protection will NOT solve anything either! Is it ONLY for those who have it now OR would you continue to grant it to more? Reagan gave the Illegals a path to citizenship & all it did was start the massive problem we have now :( They get welfare & food stamps for the ANCHOR BABIES & some even get SSD for them, we give them FEDERAL TAX ID NUMBERS to work ILLEGALLY in the USA, many "lawmakers" have enacted "Sanctuary Cities" protecting ILLEGAL CRIMINALS, my question is WHY have OUR top Gov't officials done this to Americans? And WHERE DOES IT END? Until ALL these things are addressed & stopped, Americans will continue to suffer & be robbed while those in DC, Governors Mansions, etc. are NOT affected :( SHAME ON ALL WHO LET IT GET THIS OUT OF CONTROL!!!!!
NO WALL! I HAVE NO IDEA OF what you think America was because the America I grew up with was harsh. Health care was waiting all day food was unavailable and remember sleeping in the bus station as a child. A little better now and you want to return to That hard time. You ARE AN IDIOT! IS
Over 300 illegals broke into my state of AZ this week. After attempting to dig under our pathetic little wall and getting caught, the gates were thrown open for them when they asked for asylum. 😮 This is the most messed up thing I can imagine! Trying to break in, then being allowed in when caught?! 😡
Do not give in,  finish showing their corruption and build the wall.  We are with you

It was gross seeing NANCY put out a screw you letter to DACA AGAIN and the workers BEFORE you ever spoke... but this is what the next two years will be like. Total obstruction at the expense of Americans.

What about all those families impacted my good old American born killers with guns?
I bet the group of families of children killed by inbred, flag waving, fake patriot extremists with war weapons is a MUCH bigger group, Having a pissing-pain contest to get yourself on Faux News and grab the orange imbecile's attention is a waste of their efforts to curb senseless murders.
A great negotiator would not need to hold over one million Americans hostage, causing them financial anxiety and pain in order to “negotiate.”  If that is the best approach to “negotiating” you have, you are certainly NOT even a good negotiator, let alone a great negotiator.  You told us your “strategy” in your book The Art of the Deal: “I play to people’s fantasies.”  Grow up. Stop hurting our fellow citizens to get your way.  Open the government - NOW....  Then start genuine open give and take negotiations in Congress to ID smart and effective enhancements to our border security, coupled with permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship for the DACA folk......  It is terrible for you to be hurting over one million Americans as part of your “negotiating” strategy.  No wait, it is worse than terrible. It is IMMORAL

The Democrats supported “Border Security". along with a complete overhaul of our Immigration Policy, so dust off Schumer’s 2013 Bill (that the Republicans killed in the House), have Trump sign it and get Win Win Wall!!  On June 27, 2013, the Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act by a 68-32 margin ... The Bill was Not Considered by United States House of Representatives and Died in the 113th Congress!
Hey Orange 🍊 do you really think I’m stupid enough to accept your cat fishing friend requests from gorgeous women with fake profiles?  You’re dumber than I thought.  You don’t have to work for the NSA to know how to type the word netstat into cmd line

Illegal immigrants are far less likely to commit crimes  than native-born Americans.  The number of illegal immigrants has decreased over the past 10 years.   Dare to learn the truth  and not believe Trmp's lies.
Is the pledge the same as the one where you said Mexico will pay for the wall? You do know walls won't stop this from happening, dumbass. 🙄
Our borders need to be secured (Wall) & all those incentive's for Illegals to come must be removed now. Otherwise we'll find ourselves in this mess for the 3rd time. It sounds like there is 5,500 people in these 2 Caravan and another on it's way. I'm hearing more to come in Feb first wk. Congress Wake Up!! Call 1-800-350-6647 then press 1 it tells the government We want the Wall.
Dear Mr. President, I applaud your speech yesterday.   You have shown that you are willing to compromise.   The democrats have shown that they don’t care about compromise at all.   They care about the 2020 elections! Not about American citizens.  Nancy Pelosi accused you of acting childish.   Well, SHE is the one being stubborn and acting childish and dare I say, acting like a bully!  I’m sure there are democrats who would sit down with you and work out a deal but they dare not do it because of the expected “wrath“ of Nancy Pelosi.  Here is a solution : end the shutdown and put these innocent government workers back to work immediately.  HOWEVER,  ask Nancy and Chuck and ALL OF CONGRESS to halt their pay AND THAT OF THEIR AIDES AND ENTOURAGE until a deal is worked out! Then everyone needs to work non-stop, 24 hours a day, until a mutual resolution is found that will protect US as American citizens.
PUT THE MILITARY ON THE BORDER WE, THE MIDDLE CLASS - YOUR BASE- SPENT $1.5 TRILLION FOR THE MILITARY. IF YOU LOVED THIS COUNTRY, YOU WOULD NOT ALLOW ENTRY OF THESE MONSTERS COMING FOR MORE MONEY FOR BEING ON THE DOLE THAN WORKING AMERICANS MAKE OR THE AVERAGE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY LIVING FROM PAYDAY TO PAYDAY. No one in your family pays taxes and I hate you for it now. I hate you for allowing Caravans to destroy our Country on the Cheap. I hate you for not putting the Military at every inch of the Country to protect it from garbage to support forever.
You notice the people most vocal against the wall are people that are nowhere near the southern border?!
Cult talk 60% of your undercover welfare receiving Cult members don't work anyway their lazy asses blame immigrants and anyone else why they're so lazy. They don't care about work only a Irrelevant Wall.
As the Trump administration demands funding for a border wall, a new study finds that for the seventh year in a row, visa overstays far exceeded unauthorized border crossings.

we the people of america don't need a compromise on any illegal immigration what we want is no more illegal immigration agaist our laws . comprimises on illegals who tell us what they will do and invade our border  0---no thanks . how does that rational protect our country ? what we want is for our elected presaident to do his job as his oath says protect our people and country fom invasion of our borders .no more games with congress the law is being broken by invaders their oath also says they woll protect this nation . nobody has honored that oath yet the same thing goes on for years . you people of congress have a duty fo the citizens of americaand nobody else .
Sir, with more caravans careening toward the U.S., with Mexico "helpless" (and no will) against stopping them, with Pelosi's stubbornness at the expense of Dreamers, PLEASE 1) stop ALL monies, foreign aid, etc. to Mexico and Central America until they stop offloading those they don't want onto us, including Child Tax Credits. Defund any state who uses fed gov $$$ for sanctuary or welfare for illegals.  2)  Tie the Ninth Circuit into knots if necessary; it is unconscionable that one court is the tail that wags the whole nation with injunctions. Let Jay Sekulow loose on this. Alan Sears and Mat Staver, too.  3) Prevent all money earned in the US from being wired to Mexico and Central America.  4) Since Congress has failed miserably to stem the influx or to stop their entry, do whatever it takes to repel at the border; let Mexico arrange the trips home for the illegals. "This far and no farther" at our border. 5) Discover who is funding the transportation for the illegal caravans; drag them into court, sue into oblivion. Charge for enabling crimes against the citizens of the US.  6) Allow no amnesty except if begun properly in the homeland.  7) Use cash and property seized from Mexican cartels to secure the border absolutely.  8) See if the FCC can demand the faces of the 4,000+ killed by illegals recently can be scrolled across the bottom of every screen in the nation. Enough is enough. This far and no farther.
When will you protect our children at school? At the synagogues? At church? At bars? At work? At music festivals? At movie theatres? All slaughtered innocents by American white men w/easy access  to military weapons
Not only do I want the wall built and maintained I want Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of these traitors to be removed from our congress for crimes against our country and our constitution.

How about the mothers and wives of those killed by gun violence in the USA? 14,400 Americans gunned down in 2018? Are they angel mothers too? Any death is horrific. But: to exploit these women as a bargaining chip shows how little morals you people have
Trump tweet: "To have a little of that good old fashioned global warming right now." This is the president of the United States. Mocking global warming. First of all: this is a weather event less than a month into the winter? Hello? Plus: do you understand science? You are a clear and present danger to my grandchildren. What a jackass. And folks, spare me the "cycle" bullshit, because that is nonsense. Greenland is melting now.  Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tons of ice since 1970. Ocean at record warmth. Forest dying from excessive heat/ocean pH dropping.  Fish species disappearing. “Be careful and try staying in your house,” the president tweeted. “Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right.
Just like the Orange Monster’s lie that Latinos like him, Jews should have the same concerns when embraced by the Crime Family:  “Conservative friends, a lot of you voted for Trump because of his support for Israel.   During his presidency there have been multiple acts of terrorism against American Jews, including this latest shooting in Pittsburgh. All of these actions have been taken by far right extremists (the Pittsburgh shooter blamed Jews for assisting the migrant caravan in Mexico).   My question to you is, are you willing to accept that the rhetoric of violence and hatred that Trump embraces is, at least in part, to blame for the rise in antisemetic terror? Is your support of Israel a genuine act of solidarity with the Jewish people, or are you simply choosing a side in your greater battle against Islam? Because as someone with very recent Jewish ancestry, I can assure you that the far-right has never been a friend to the Jewish people.   American Jews stood hand in hand with African Americans in their fight for equality, American Jews are an ethnic minority STILL fighting for civil treatment in this country. 71% of American Jews voted for Hillary Clinton and an even greater number will vote against Trump in 2020.   Conservative and Republican friends, the Jews are not your allies and you have proven that with your continued support of the alt-right and Donald Trump, so please do not use them for your political agenda any longer.” - Carlos Brandon, posted October 2018
Don’t back down. It’s time to break democrats once and for all. Build the wall!!!!
you are a failure you need to quit you have bankrupted yourself you're a liar a phony a cheat and there's nothing new to describe how disgraceful you are please leave America go to Russia where they have the best looking prostitutes in the world according to your buddy
Can we go around Nancy Pelosi? Can we go straight to the House Democrats, or is Nancy Pelosi the only one that can bring a measure to the floor and have it voted on?
Mr. Trump, please know that there actually really are Federal Workers who want the barrier and understand that Nancy and Chuck are the demons here. If we don’t get our next check, it’s on batshit Nancy.
But you did NOTHING in your first two years in office! Meanwhile, more than 1,500 criminal aliens were CONVICTED of homicide and more than 3,700 CONVICTED of sexual assault. (SOURCE: Dept. of Homeland Security, testimony presented to Congress in an open hearing. July 2018) ... But you and Jared focused on getting the prison reform bill passed -- which was a high priority for Dems -- without demanding they provide funding for the wall. Pathetic.
You bumb ass inconsiderate incapable unaware of you who pissing off mc Donald’s sponsoring half dead muthafucka get on my last nerves If u want a wall so bad u go over there and build that mf yo damn self ol pissy pot bitch ass nigga!
Reading the holy Gospel according to saint John (2, 1-11)  Glory to you, Lord.  There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding. When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him,  "They have no wine."  And Jesus said to her,  "Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come."  His mother said to the servers,  "Do whatever he tells you."  Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus told them,  "Fill the jars with water."  So they filled them to the brim. Then he told them,  "Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter."  So they took it. And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, without knowing where it came from ---although the servers who had drawn the water knew---, the headwaiter called the bridegroom and said to him,  "Everyone serves good wine first, and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the good wine until now."  Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs at Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him.  Word of the Lord. Glory to you, Lord Jesus.
God bless our President. He certainly did not need to put himself and family through all of this but he works tirelessly for the good of our country. The Democrats and the leftwing media constantly bash him and lie and spread false stories.  The media does not report the GDP is way up or that wages are up... unemployment is low and record low for the black community. They run with every lie and then talk about it as an impeachable offense. You’re fed this day in and day out. Sick of the lies !  Can the Left see for them selves ? Wake up for goodness sake! I hope something happens that the left wing media is forced to admit truth and stop lying! What miserable people!
Latino support for Trump on the rise? Not so fast: PLEASE READ THIS!  BY RAUL REYES The Hill  With an odd echo of Sally Field's "You like me!" speech at the Oscars, Donald Trump on Tuesday touted findings from a poll that he viewed as showing a surge of approval from Latinos. “Marist/NPR/PBS Poll shows President Trump’s approval rating among Latinos going to 50%, an increase in one year of 19%. Thank you, working hard!” he Tweeted. The president also bragged on Sunday about his support from Hispanics, tweeting,“That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.”  What’s wrong with this picture? Just about everything.  If you find it suspect that Hispanics would be warming to the most anti-Latino and anti-immigrant president in history — during the government shutdown over the wall, no less — you’re right. Trump’s reaction to this polling, as well as the poll itself, does not really reflect an accurate snapshot of Latino political views.  In his Sunday tweet, the president asserted that Hispanics “know the Border issue better than anyone.” This is a presumption without evidence, and may come as a surprise to the millions of assimilated, U.S.-born Latinos who do not live anywhere near our southern border. Although Latinos certainly care about immigration, immigration issues are not necessarily the same as border issues. The questions surrounding DACA and the Dreamers, for example, have little to do with the border.  With respect to the Marist poll cited by Trump, its findings about Hispanics are worthy of some skepticism. The poll was conducted in English, which suggests it may have excluded the 36 percent of U.S. Latinos who identify as Spanish-language dominant. It was conducted only in the contiguous U.S., meaning Puerto Rico was left out. Although Hispanics constitute 18 percent of the U.S. population, the poll used a data set that was 15 percent Hispanic.  Breaking the numbers down, the poll of 1,023 people included about 154 Latinos. Think about it: 154 people were used to draw conclusions about a demographic that the Census Bureau reports numbers 58.9 million. As the website Latino Rebels commented, “We’ve done Twitter polls with more respondents.”  There is nothing wrong with including a proportional representation of Latinos in a national poll. The problems arise when a small sampling of Latinos is used to extrapolate findings about the broader Hispanic population. In statistical terms, allowing 154 individuals to stand in for 58.9 million people results in a margin of error of eight percent — a figure outside what many pollsters would consider reliable.  For what it’s worth, the same poll showed that 58 percent of Hispanics did not plan to vote for Trump, compared to 27 percent who did. Funny how the president left this finding out of his tweets.  Controversies around Latino opinion surveys are nothing new, most notably in the 2016 presidential election when Hispanic support for Trump was hotly disputed by experts. Nate Cohn pointed out that pollsters tend to sample a disproportionately Republican group of Hispanic voters, leading to results that skew right. And it is not easy to compile accurate data about Hispanics. The Latino community is diverse and surveying it requires sophisticated methodology. That’s why there are companies and organizations like Latino Decisions and the Pew Research Center devoted to this complex task. A 2018 Pew survey on the Latino community, for instance, was bilingual and used 1,501 Hispanic adults.  True, there are Latinos who support Trump, for the same reasons that other Americans do: because they are steadfast Republicans, because they admire his business background, or because they like his policies. But they are a minority among the Latino community. The best evidence we have of this can be seen in the 2018 midterm results. An estimated 69 percent of Latinos voted for the Democratic candidate, Pew reports, compared with just 29 percent who backed a Republican candidate.  Just like a majority of other Americans, a solid majority of Latinos pushed back against Trump and his policies.  In our current political climate, it’s doubtful that Trump’s approval among Latinos is soaring. While the president can still count on support from his base, it doesn’t include most Latinos — and that is not fake news.

Deport your illegal alien wife, parents and birther son
Screw them.  Deport ALL ILLEGALS and build a WALL.
That is why I voted for you and will vote for you again!  Please fix this country’s serious problem with illegal immigration!  I am all for people applying for citizenship.  If they are sneaky enough to come here illegally, what else will they be sneaky about!  My son works full time plus overtime and still has to live in my basement as this state has insane rent rates!  Why is it he pays for health Insurance, can’t afford a decent apartment, has to buy his own food yet an illegal can walk right in and have all that on my son’s dime when he can’t have that himself?
How do you control China’s illegal immigrants?
Fight Facebook’s targeting and suspension of users who call out the left for hate speech against the President. Facebook allows trolls like Jere Gallimore to bully and harass with impunity. Post names of all trolls who bully and harass and report these trolls en masse.  Trump supporters on Facebook must organize like they do and fight back.
I WANT YOU IMPEACHMENT MOTHER FUCKER.
If that’s true, then arrest Shmuker and Palosi for treason and not performing their oath of office. Need to get this party started.
God bless all the Angel Families. I regret that Nancy Pelosi chose to dishonor you and your loved ones. You have the majority behind you.  Of course Nancy Pelosi does not recognize us either.  Stand strong.
Build the wall protect American s
Get rid of Pelosi she is a jerk
Build the wall! We just had an illegal immigrant murder 4 innocent people in our area. Could have been prevented.
Your not fixing anything your just making a jackass of yourself and of America
We need the damn wall up put it up or close the border.
I want USA safe and free from socialism, communism and other threats. Build the wall.
I have an idea President Trump, why don't you threaten to tear down the walls at the California and Texas borders.  Then we'll see just how quickly Pelosi (and all the American people that cannot see the value and necessity of having walls and security) realizes that we need them...  Anyone is welcome into our country as long as you are vetted, non-criminals, healthy, and legal.  The same process our grand, great grand, great great grand parents had to go through.  Filled out the proper paper work, quarantined until well, became legal and paid taxes, and turned away if they were criminals.  It is much, much easier for the Cartel and terrorists (from all over the world) to get into our country from Mexico.  This is really scary America!  We need security at our borders, people!
No, we don't want your stupid wall!
WE WILL CONQUER THE COMMUNIST!
You self-centered ignorant sorry excuse for a human being federal employees in soup lines are you serious may God take your sorry ass out amen
Shut down Congress's pay until this government shutdown is resolved. They should not get played to vacation while the government is shutdown, shutdown Congress.
There is nothing funny about this. The families deserve respect and know the American people care. Really? Someone is going to laugh when someone has been murdered? Murder in itself is illegal, illegal immigration is illegal. Everyone in government jobs will recieve back pay. You can't bring back the dead. You can only fight for the dead and realize that their life mattered.
You haven't done squat except deprive families of their paychex - WORST president EVER
Mr Donald  here is a easy solution for the wall.  There is 11,000,000 plus  illegal  immigrants in USA. Give them ID, S.S# to do taxes. Permit or resident card to get a job. Good behavior  in exchange of  $3,300,000,000.00 every year. 11,000,000 immigrants  each immigrant  willing to paid $300.00 a yrs  to maintain  their papers.  11,000,000 X $300 =$3,300,000,000. Now in 10 yrs do the math.
Keep that government shut down. Democrats are too stupid to come to the table ... let them own every further day of shutdown.
Resign you dirty grifter.
Phuck you!!!!! Your a disgrace to our country!!!!!!!
Put the illegal aliens on a chain gang to build the wall they force America to need!
Stop the iligals criminals!!! Build the wall!!!
Why Liberals just don’t understand these Trump Supporters   A question asked by a Trump supporter: "Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid?”  Here's what we really think about Trump supporters - the rich, the poor, the malignant and the innocently well-meaning, the ones who think and the ones who don’t...  That when you saw a man who had owned a fraudulent University, intent on scamming poor people, you thought “Fine."  That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, “Okay."  That when you heard him proudly brag about his own history of sexual abuse, you said, "No problem.”  That when he made up stories about seeing Muslim-Americans in the thousands cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center, you said, "Not an issue.”  That when you saw him brag that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue and you wouldn't care, you chirped, "knows me.”  That when you heard him illustrate his own character by telling that cute story about the elderly guest bleeding on the floor at his country club, the story about how he turned his back and how it was all an imposition on him, you said, "That's cool!”  That when you saw him mock the disabled, you thought it was the funniest thing you ever saw.  That when you heard him brag that he doesn't read books, you said, "Well, who has time?”  That when the Central Park Five were compensated as innocent men convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and he angrily said that they should still be in prison, you said, "That makes sense.”  That when you heard him tell his supporters to beat up protesters and that he would hire attorneys, you thought, “Yes!"  That when you heard him tell one rally to confiscate a man's coat before throwing him out into the freezing cold, you said, "What a great guy!”  That you have watched the parade of Neo-Nazis and white supremacists with whom he curries favor, while refusing to condemn outright Nazis, and you have said, "Thumbs up!”  That you hear him unable to talk to foreign dignitaries without insulting their countries and demanding that they praise his electoral win, you said, "That's the way I want my President to be.”  That you have watched him remove expertise from all layers of government in favor of people who make money off of eliminating protections in the industries they're supposed to be regulating and you have said, "What a genius!”  That you have heard him continue to profit from his businesses, in part by leveraging his position as President, to the point of overcharging the Secret Service for space in the properties he owns, and you have said, "That's smart!”  That you have heard him say that it was difficult to help Puerto Rico because it was the middle of water and you have said, "That makes sense.”  That you have seen him start fights with every country from Canada to New Zealand while praising Russia and quote, "falling in love" with the dictator of North Korea, and you have said, "That's statesmanship!”  That Trump separated children from their families and put them in cages, managed to lose track of 1500 kids, has opened a tent city concentration camp in the desert in Texas - he explains that they're just "animals" - and you say, "Well, OK then.”  That you have witnessed all the thousand and one other manifestations of corruption and low moral character and outright animalistic rudeness and contempt for you, the working American voter, and you still show up grinning and wearing your MAGA hats and threatening to beat up anybody who says otherwise.  What you don't get, Trump supporters in 2019, is that succumbing to frustration and thinking of you as stupid may be wrong and unhelpful, but it's also...hear me...charitable. Because if you're NOT stupid, we must turn to other explanations, and most of them are less flattering.  (Author unknown)
This man is the most hated in the WORLD LOCK HIM UP

I can’t believe our Current members of Congress do not care that citizens are being killed by illegal immigrants. We need to recognize the sea change in the Democrat Party and demand answers.....

Now here is an idea. How about we stop handing out free health care  food stamps  and housing to the ones who come here illegally!!! I believe this would greatly reduce the flow of illegals coming here to live off the working Americam citizens.  Then maybe we can start caring for this countries homeless and hungry people.
My son Jake pass away in 2015. He had seizures that killed him,  but it was from a drug called Death Ice too. That drug came across our borders that was part of his passing. He would of not been killed if the illegals did not bring drugs from Mexico. Please build the wall for him and all that has been killed. God bless!
Take five billion out of the Congress's pension fund for the wall -- like they did with our social security! .. Congress is incompetent anyway! 😡🤡💩🔴

4 elderly people in Douglas and Washoe counties here in Nevada, were murdered in there homes in the last week. 19 year old illegal alien has been arrested for it. Please Mr President. Vindicate these murders. Build that wall.
Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace. She should have met with the Angel Families. Unfortunately, she doesn't care about these people or anyone else for that fact. Nancy is only interested in Nancy.
4 murders in our community from guess what.....an illegal immigrant.
Donald J Trump...Mr President Trump,  The Democrats and all your enemies may seem like "many" because they are loud, obnoxious  critical, disrespectful, fit-throwing cry babies just like when one tiny baby can cry, whine and throw fits and drown out an entire family. WE, the Republicans and all your supporters, may seem like "few" because you dont hear much from us. We dont act stupid like the Democratic rioters, looters and cry babies. BUT, WE ARE "MANY"! We are as strong and as mean as they are, and we CAN and WILL get loud if need be. We want you to know that we strongly beside you, solid as a rock, through thick and thin. We see and understand all your efforts to make America great again. We continuously pray for you, your family and your presidency. We love you and appreciate you. We won't let let you down. Keep going strong! In Jesus' Name. IN GOD WE TRUST!!!
Spineless Trump: according to the latest e-humnt in me. I believe, I will make you inverted to. since you like dick in your mouth, now ill see that you swallow it.  strong for venezia
Thank you Mr. President. We watched your speech yesterday. It was fantastic. Build that wall! Sick of these Dems putting illegals before Americans.

It's time for American people to pull Nancy and Chuck out of their "Rat holes" to do what taxpayers have been paying them to do. People are power, they are our servers. We all should stand behind our President Donald Trump and raise our voices to demand Nancy Pelosi to BUILD THE WALL with any cost from our tax dollars or step down. We don't need a Speaker who act and behave against American people. The Rats should get over the fact that President Donald J Trump is their President, stop playing political games that only TRAITORS do. Trump 2020🇱🇷
How many trillions have been spent on wars, and now socialists want to open the boarders and invite the war here. My small community was pummelled with rapists and murderers because LEGAL immigrants came from WAR TORN COUNTRIES and bring the hate and violence with them. WHO SCREENED THESE PEOPLE?!?!
What about all the lives lost I. These mass shootings that have taken place in movie theaters, concerts, high schools and elementary schools, colleges, churches and bars. ALL COMMITTED BY WHITE MALE Americans!!! Why doesn’t he EVER talk about that?! He talks about the officer that was killed by an illegal immigrant the day after Christmas. But has he even spoken of the Officer Natalie Corona only 23 years old who was shot and killed two days later by a white man who was American?! Why hasn’t he addressed that? Because it contradicts everything he stands for! This nation is built on imagination! His own grandparents are immigrants! But of course they are the right color of immigrants. This is indigenous land!! Yet he makes every white person feel entitled to treat anyone of color horrible. Just like those horrible kids mocking a Native American veteran out of pure hate. That’s is what this man is doing to our country. He is filling it with hatred.
Open the government and stop being such a coward.
So... you want 5.6B... and for that you shut down the USG, and by doing that, put our securety at higher risk then before?? You must be a special kind of stupid, ain't ya?
I could really care less just open the freaking government you stubborn bastard!
I could really care less just open the freaking government you stubborn bastard!
Americans want a wall just like the one in San Antonio that Trump says works so well.
We, the People, agree that we need to "fix our broken immigration system"  However, We, the People, will NOT tell Nancy we want the wall.  We, the People are telling YOU we only want the wall that is funded IN ADVANCE by Mexico. Our money should not be spent on an ineffective wall that can be dug under, climbed over or flown over or that can have drones flown over.     A better use of our money would be to create jobs by increasing Border Patrol agents and the staff to process refugees.

Take the welfare and tax return s they claim kids still in Mexico
Now what do you say Democrats?  How do you look at a mother and tell her her child doesn’t matter because an illegal alien killed them?  I’m waiting...
Stay strong build the wall, drain that swamp and maybe you can even help those democrats clean their house
The Democrats don’t care nothing about this moms son that got killed my and they don’t care how many men and woman die trying to keep America safe only the Democrats care about is the 2020 election 🗳 and gaining there control back and there power back that’s all people wake up and take back your America god bless America
The government needs to stop paying out to illegals by giving them welfare, jobs, etc. And instead use the money they'd save on the wall!!! Illegals shouldn't be receiving welfare, getting jobs, receiving tax refunds or any thing period.
That is enough, the dumb bitch. Should be ran out of Washington and removed from Speaker at least !
Anyone gots facts?
How much does it cost tax payers for just one year to support the illegals we have now?
Expel every single one who is here illegally. Let's start there!
SENT THE CROOKED MAFIA BITCH TO GITMO
It’s pretty shameful that the dems were calling for more border control when they had a president in the White House , but now they are so butt-hurt that they lost, they don’t care about anything except going against what our current president asks for. Even at the cost of our own people. When does it stop?  These people need term limits. They’ve  had too much power for far too long.
They are filing taxes I'm Indiana an other states with fake social security numbers getting over 10,000.00 back in taxes claiming over 10 kids in Mexico. An they don't even have kids. Stop giving our income tax money away. Build a wall. Stop the flow. Most American don't get but 3 thousand back in taxes. The Mexican are stealing our tax dollars in all lower state the proof is on whistle blower.
STOP ALL AID $ being sent to Mexico. They are using OUR tax $ that is being given as foreign aid to HELP these illegals get to the border! We can USE that money to build the WALL!!!!!
That dumb cunt wont listen
David Williams , FACTS Printed, able to verify asking because worked in that field for 20 years . How about 4 generation in one family milking the system that fine with you , getting benefits just by getting a doctor signing a letter another mom and 4 kids collecting money they never paid into making more money in a month then I did $4000 and then being told that if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have a job last name Conner
3 billion in tax returns to illegal aliens with no social security number under child credit act, billions In social services to illegals, Billions In aid to countries that don’t help. Politicians getting paid while front line doesn’t, What a screwed up system, 4 billion for a wall can’t be anymore ludicrous then the other stupid crap going on.
Declare state of emergency & close the border. The Republicans need to fix this without Dems support
Exterminate the Satan Evil axis Kim Jong Un. Never co-operate with the demons. I said this more than 1,000 times.
Build the wall and fix immigration
Build the Wall, Tall and Beautiful , the Democrats better start working as a team to negotiate or I can tell you this much, either way they have no chance against my man Trump in 2020, but they will just look like even more of fools come next election .
Build that wall, keep us all safe!!!
DemocRATS are as evil as you can get.  They hate Trump and are trying their very best to make him fail. Most of the country is behind him. This man is behind him 150%. Go Mr. President go!!
President Trump is the GOAT.  If he keeps going like he's going, he will be the GOAT of the GOATs. Short of Jesus of course.
Bonnie Massey how do we tell President Trump we want him to resign I think that there should be a petition for all Americans to be able to sign
How do we tell Nancy and Shurmer we want them to resign I think that should be a petition all Americans should be able to sign also because every where I go it's all I hear people saying they.  Want these two idiots out

You are an abomination. Just go away.
You are an abomination. Just go away.
Mr. President we stand behind you in this effort.  Please stop these caravans and every incentive that brings them here. Find and arrest those who are funding this attack n the United States under the guise of oppression....every country in the world has oppression and we can't fix all their problems.  We need to start helping U.S. citizens first!  So tired of our money given to sanctuary cities...abortion rights groups.....and  supporting those who come here illegally and thrust their flags and middle fingers in our faces!.   I would like to stop all aid to these countries who don't take care of their own people. Stop the anchor baby program......no other country has this! Use your executive privilege soon before it's too late. Our people need to go back to work and shouldn't suffer another day w/o paychecks.
There should be a law forbidding shutting down the government.  Those in violation of this law should be removed from office and jailed.
Pay no mind to these leftist lunatics. Build that wall!
The DemonRats are like major obstacles & dead ends in Trump's way.They know the truth & they know what's going on at the southern border, but Nancy & Chuck the schmuck, want Trump to fail & that's why they're saying NO to everything he wants. I believe Trump will do what's right for his country because unlike the DemonRats, he really cares & will do what he has to do, NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!
The Statue of Liberty welcomed every ship bound for Ellis Island, it’s size and position in the harbor shouted Welcome to the United States of America.   Those emigrating  to this country PAID (yes, paid!) to board a ship as a passenger at their port of departure. There was never a guarantee that their paid passage would not end up with one or all of their family members being returned. They were not required to have a passport or visa. However, they were REQUIRED to enter this country LEGALLY. Incoming ships to the port of New York were stopped at a small island off the coast of Staten Island prior to being received at Ellis Island. Inspectors would board the ships to vet passengers who were deemed mentally or physically ill or any who were involved in criminal activity. Those passengers deemed a threat to the well being of our country, were NOT gained entry. The remainder of the passengers were forwarded to Ellis Island where they were processed. Thousands of immigrants arrived daily to Ellis Island and in most cases their processing took only a few hours and then immigrants were released to acquire citizenship (which most did) Those who were cleared to enter the USA were directed to rail transportation in order to connect with their DOCUMENTED SPONSOR. Immigrants waiting to be processed were afforded the opportunity to BUY ( yes buy - not given) food at the Ellis Island commissary after exchanging their currency.  Those who were detained for health reasons were placed in a holding pattern and were given food and drink for free. If a child over the age of 12 was denied entry due to illness, they were sent back to their country of origin ALONE via ship. Those under 12  who were not deemed healthy enough to stay were SENT BACK to their country of origin with one parent. Children and adults requiring any type of medical attention were sometimes held in the infirmary and were CHARGED A FEE (Yes they paid) for any medical services. My great grandparents along with millions of those who emigrated here from various countries did so by LEGAL means and were not afforded a free ride, nor did they expect anything for free except entering a country where all citizens lived freely.  When they arrived, family took care of family. I am proud of my Italian/Irish ancestry. Reopen Port(s) of legal entry similar to Ellis Island and apply those same rules. In addition, those who fail to enter legally through the legal port(s) of entry will be denied citizenship forever and remain deported.  Allow all illegals presently living here to be processed in a similar fashion.  If they have been receiving assistance from the government and have not obtained work,  make a mandatory military service of 2 years minimum to gain immediate citizenship. Any new citizen convicted of a major crime within one year of obtaining a citizenship will be deported. As an employee working at the World Trade Center, I survived two terror attacks. How I remember the flags waving and the “we will never forget” signs, post 9/11. How quickly everyone forgets. I will never forget the numerous funerals I attended, nor the fear I still live with to this day from what I witnessed. Welcome to the United States of America to all those who wish to do so legally and are willing to give back to this country by working and making this great land of immigrants a prosperous and safe place for future generations.   God Bless the USA!!
both of you are stupid cunts
I am sick and tired of illegals coming into this country and using the system to their benefit.  Don't just build the wall, deport any and all illegals the hell outta here, they are a stain on the underlying pants of society.
OK. Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are not going to give in, even after the offer of the DACA compromise, so now it is time. Declare the State of Emergency due to our unsecured borders. More caravans are coming. Stop this madness. We are all behind you, Mr. President. Do it now or at the State of the Union address, just do it. Our nation's security depends upon it. Build the wall!
We need to fix our broken Democrats too.
During his sad speech Trump cited his usual impeccable sources: "some say", "many people say", "the voices in my head said", "Baby Ann Coulter said", "experts who don't exist said", "a Mom in Wyoming who I just invented told me" and "the genie who lives in my golf bag testified"  https://twitter.com/PaulRudnickNY/status/1086743098850533376
Our country will go to hell if we don't close our borders.  Nancy Pelosi wanted closed borders back in 2008.  She hates President Trump so much that she will fight him regardless of what he wants.  She has to go along with her gang of idiots.  She doesn't care about us, she only cares about herself and her selfish ways.  How can someone change so much?  She couldn't face the Angel families, why is she embarrassed to face them because she knows what she's doing is wrong.  She's acting like an over privileged spoiled brat.  I have NO respect for her.  She has a WALL around her home for protection, maybe we need to take her WALL down if we can't have our WALL to protect us from illegals.

Check this bullshit out share share share
You’re all so blind. Fuckin Idiots
Two more caravans on the way . Someone is funding them and need to be prosecuted. Millions estimated to arrive on open field this year according to Spanish media last year.
Go Trump go! The blame for the government shutdown is no longer on you! It’s on Nancy Pelosi! Some times, when you’re dealing with cold hearted people, you have to get rough in order for them to see your meaning! She is definitely anti-Christian and DOES NOT stand for our country. BUT...PRAISE GOD THAT WE HAVE A MAN WHO WILL! Thank you #Trump for everything you’re doing. Right now it may hurt some people, but in the end it’ll help EVERYONE! Thank you, GOD for this man! Continue to use him, Lord!
illegal immigration equals democrat votes...Thats the only reason Nancy wants open borders...She does not care anything about their well being...Mt President Donald J. Trump. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
All people coming here should  have to have a sponsor to help them . No gov assistance .we can't hold all the people that want to be free and must help fix their country .WE have the greatest country in the world lets not let college educated idiot's destroy it!!!
Fix our Broken Corrupted Government First .
Pelosi is a major player in the destruction of the democratic party.  They do nothing for the people and eventually the brainwashed masses we realize they have supported the wrong people for a long long time.
TRUTH - It is terrifying to think that almost every single air traffic controller in the United States is currently distracted at work because they don't know when their next paycheck is coming. Think about that the next time you get on an plane. Oh, and how do you think TSA workers are feeling, working without pay?
Also made a pledge that Mexico  was paying for your stupid wall!
25 million illegal immigrants are in the United States it's time to find them all tag them all and ship them back or place their asses in life imprisonment
After what they just turned down Don't give them anything. Nothing
Well how about telling the President to stop babying the Dems. Open up the government and put a freeze on all spending and hiring.  Close ALL THE borders until the immigration laws are changed by congress and start DEPORTING everyone who is here illegally.
In Fla Illegal aliens stole  children raised them for slaves or prostitution
Surely their is funding somewhere for the completion of the wall and a military presence there, and get people back to work without having to depend upon the Deplorable Dems. Those who came illegally should be deported unless they apply for asylum at THEIR US embassy where they can be heard quickly and be housed and protected in lieu at that site until their onsite asylum hearing.NO BENEFITS for those who cross illegally, they should be deported to their local US embassy immediately.
American's be reminded Hairy Diarrhea Mouth Baboon Trump caused the shutdown, same Bill last month,he signs yesterday,what stuns me your information,that Democrats did not talk to Angel Families,also all the information about Democratics,media,your negatives to everyone that disagrees with you and Hairy Diarrhea Mouth Baboon Trump,campaign promise Mexico will pay for the wall.
Worst fake trump news, impeachment  needed
Lies and the liars that lie them.
Your a fuckin clown you disgusting person
SHOULD BUILD A WALL AROUND YOU
Our border (the Southern one) is safe and secure. THERE IS NO BORDER CRISIS. Looks like you intend to continue to hold federal workers hostage bc you are NOT getting an insanely expensive, unnecessary and useless amount of money for that damned wall.

Why can’t we use Thoughts and Prayers to protect the border?  It’s what we use to protect our schools.
****"A Leader Fight For His People At Best ,killary must known it,mad opera or michel has to ask votes of "Americans"not isis terrorist 's or drugs/underworld gang's votes ,Guys vote power with us ,nancy and team has limited time power only ,Think....!!!! 　 " ****
Do you not realize that this happens with legal Americans as well? It is a flaw in our justice system not a flaw because it was an illegal immigrant. This is a judicial flaw not an immigration flaw. Fix the problem with our courts so that all repeat offenders and law breakers are stopped not just illegal immigrants.
Build the wall! America needs this to protect ourselves.
Build the wall! ALSO institute legislation for immediate death penalty for anyone attempting murder on a police officer! I am sick of seeing the death of our LEOs at the hands of criminals! PLEASE, please put this at the top of your list POTUS.
The Trump crowd thinks taking a knee at an NFL football game is disrespectful to veterans. Yelling build the wall at them, well that is just good old Christian values at work.

Build the wall. Do not let these caravan people into our country.
My dad  may have it right. Makes sense! His comment here is from another post.  It is clear to me now that it's all about the 2020 Election.  His comment:  What the wall and sanctuary cities and states are actually about is filling the states with bodies for the 2020 census. States get representatives based on the number of people -- legal or illegal -- in their state every ten years. The more people the more seats in Congress a state has. States also get money for projects based on the census. Democrats as a whole are digging in on the immigration problem as a whole only because this year is the last year they can stack the census with bodies. Although, it doesn't hurt that they can make President Trump look bad in the process. Don't look for the Demoncrats to cave on the wall or any illegal immigration issue this year.
Comment by Virginia's husband a 22 year Navy veteran. In my opinion, instead of canceling Pelosi and her gaggle's departure flight to Afghanistan....it would have been more effective to cancel their RETURN flight. MAGA...BUILD THAT WALL!!!
Build the wall, vatican has it, rich have it, White house has it, you lock your doors hine, in car, why? You think is why and know why. Common sense. Let them come legally.
Hey idiot.....most that live on the border don't see a crisis.  You can dig under a wall or fly over it.  Most drugs come in through checkpoints.  Most illegals don't come from Mexico.  You are the dumbest and most evil president ever.  You and your family need to go to Russian where you belong since you are all Russian Agent Traitors.  Most hated presdient ever.  There - you are the greatest at something.  Being Hated.
MAGA shitbags.  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6612571/He-just-blocked-way-Native-American-elder-Vietnam-veteran.html
This is what its all about. Yet the obstructionists on the left claim that its a manufactured crisis while ignoring the family members of relatives of people killed by illegals. Its just shameful.
I'm from Canada and it's not hard to see who the issue is!  That old Pelosi bitch should go out to pasture!  It would be nice if our young  Trudeau bitch could go with her!!
No,us citizens have taxes too high now. Can't affort a wall
Build.the wall around MAGA brats disrespecting American Veterans
Have Nancy and Chuck met with any of these victims to console them?
stay on them till they puke folks!
Why are we letting one crazy idiot woman hold all of America hostage. Keep calling her out somehow she has to go
"no tickee no shirtee" from a 1920's movie. no paychecks-no work...put the people back to work with due pay--no negotiations until that is done. Sick of you people holding the "peons" hostage ...using them like a bargaining chip.
‪Trump has a history not paying workers. Withholding wages to make demands.‬  ‪Now he’s trying his ransom tactics as President.Taking federal paychecks as hostage. Using Americans as bargaining chips.‬  ‪For or Against a Wall,‬ ‪He is WRONG!‬  ‪No “negotiations”‬ ‪He must End his shutdown!‬
lets also make sure we stop giving financial aid to non citizens and make sure OUR money goes to citizens FIRST, cut off all foreign aid
You guys can take the walk and shove it up your candy ass
Good morning. Mr.  President. I pray that the  democrats will see that what we need is the wall not only to protect. America but to also protect the people who want to come here legally and have a better life..the ones who are fighting you on everything are selfish and greedy and have been in the government to long.they need to retire and stop being so nasty about everything..  God is watching and they will answer for it on judgement.day just like us all when we stand before. God..there is. Nothing in this world worth going.to. he'll for an eternity..to me they are evil and don't care about anyone but themselves... I thank. God for.you and your leadership ..  I just hope you don't give up on us. I will pray for.you.and our. Vice. President that. God.will give you strength to carry one. His will
If running the government is your job and the government is shut down doesn't that make you a failure? Asking for a friend.

Nobody wants open borders, that’s just another political lie from Trump.  His “wall” is impossible to build and will accomplish nothing, that’s the truth.  You should fear a leader willing to terrorize his own people - you may be next.
30 days,  R.I.F. time. Cut the Federal Fat!
I just heard on the news another illegal immigrant that's been here for a year illegally has killed four people in Nevada so you lefties want open borders
We don’t need a wall. The majority of American don’t believe we need it. Time for you to give up Trump. #TrumpLies
Nancy should know better...as a woman looking in these moms eyes and seeing the pain...and many more to come if we dont put up the wall stop letting more criminals in this country we have enough already
Lying fool keeps repeating himself.
This hussy has not got time for the angel moms but she has time to tell people that we need to give more money and put these DACA kids through free schools now I think it is time we impeach the skanky Broad and do not give her any pensions put her out to pasture and put her out of office and anybody that follows her goes with her.
Nancy is not listening. And hasn’t been since 1981. She needs to be removed.
Build the WALL, anything less is unAmerican
You made a promise to your base..not all Americans
Impeachment / indictment is your future.  Most of Your minions are just too stupid to realize they been had by a NY charlatan.   Hopefully they will get pissed off and move somewhere more to their liking,  Siberia !
Reno Nevada just had an illegal brutally murder 4, 1 man and 3elderly women and rape them! And Jerry and Sherri were the most amazing and giving people!Build the wall Mr President! And stop Steve Sisolak from making our state a sanctuary state! My friends who were murdered by this scum need vengeance!!!!
Trump is a lying scammer. Can't trust him with anything.
Quit using us. We are not your pawns   https://www.facebook.com/142380607326/posts/10155924403507327/
Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace to our country, and the same goes to Chuck Schumer...
Nobody wants open borders, dumb ass. The crisis is fake
Build the wall.  If you have to declare a National Emergency, do it!  Whatever it takes to get it done.  Not next week, not next month, or next year.  Every day that is delayed gives Pelosi and Schumer that much longer to dig their heels in.  She has already said even if the government shutdown ends, she will still oppose funding the wall.  What more does the President need?  Speaker Pelosi is going to do whatever she can to see that her party gains full power for 2020.
Build the wall we the people want the wall 👍
Build the wall we the people want the wall 👍
I will vote for a temporary wall in exchange for a temporary extension of DACA
There are many ways to fix the immigration system. You are unwilling to listen to all of the options you insist on a wall

Most people who oppose the wall are doing so because we know it won’t work and is a waste of money. Our money. Your money. Do some research on the real reason Trump wants this wall. Never forget that wealthy people help other wealthy people and have no qualms about doing so from the sweat off your backs. Also look into our current border deterrents and the terrain over which he wants to build the wall. Please also consider that drugs are being smuggled in large shipments, by freight lines and other commercial transports that are coming through ports of entry, not in the backpacks of individuals crossing the border looking for asylum. This isn’t about left or right politics. It’s not about race (unless you make it so) for the opposers. It’s about common sense. Don’t waste my hard earned taxes on this eminent failure and symbol of hate.
It’s time for Pelosi to go. The women is off her rocker. I truly don’t understand how anyone can take her serious or back her.
Fix our broken immigration system. No Wall
I hire illegal immigrants in my business.
This lady and others lost there Children and there are ones on here with there laughing emoji ‘s.  How sad and pathetic these people are who send these , not a laughing matter . You may not like the truth as it is told to you, or Our President but have some common decency
By the way, I know you hate FACT CHECKING, but San Diego does NOT have a border wall, and that is NOT why it is such a safe city! Idiot! I cannot believe #45 is "in charge" of this country. To the Trumpers- how much ignorance can you actually put up with>????? it is pathetic when you have people like Ted Nugent saying to "shoot Democrats like coyotes". (Newsweek) YES, he said that and he is the one who has much for brains, not the Parkland students! This is one of the people that #45 listens to, but oh it will not be his fault if some nut case takes a gun and starts mowing people down. And, it is a 98% chance it would be a WHITE male between the ages of 19 and 26. Again, that is a FACT, and I know you hate that word! Get a damn clue!
Enforce our laws on illegal aliens, no jobs, no welfare! They will go home!
Don't give up and don't give in . No deal with our some sort of wall/barrier . Can't trust the democrats to deal after government is open , and the can will continue to be kicked down the road .
You know I don't care about the freaking wall anymore or any of their proposals or plans! I care about the American people. Isn't  the lower and middle class taking  the hit for this they are the ones suffering from this dag burn government shutdown. I wash my hands of the republicans and democrats.   What's going to become of those surviving off of food stamps?  What's going to become of the multitude that have basically lost their job due to this shutdown? They may be working but they aren't reaping no benefits. I mean if it goes on that's a lot of loss and destruction for so many many families, single men and women, children, etc.. oh well I babbled but my heart is heavily burdened and restless over this.
Welllll...... You're failing. Worst president in U.S. history.  LOCK HIM UP!!!
How do we in America have politicians that are anti-America, ad refuse to protect our citizens from illegals crossing our borders ad allowing them to take what we worked for and make it theirs, assaulting, raping, murdering innocent Americans by protecting the illegals and demanding OPEN BORDERS?  This is just a deliberate act by those Democracks, to flood America with foreigners and giving them the right to vote for them without being citizens.  This is an atrocity to Americans, and abomination to our country ad the lives of our AMERICAN CITIZENS.
Build the Wall Sir and no Amnesty
If I were you I would give those DACA idiots permanent residency to shut dems mouth and then see what will be the arguments not to give you the money for border security and the wall!!
Liar Fraud  Traitor  Thief  Criminal  Moron
Well...  STOP THE INVADERS BEFORE THEY CROSS OUR BOARDER.
Trump shouldn’t have to fight for border security - it is the only decent thing to do. Pelosi is immoral and I believe she drinks too much. She does not serve the people - she only serves the illegals and criminals.
Build the wall. No amnesty for those who started here illegally. Send a message. Do it right
Build the wall ! Leave the Democrats out! Build the wall , call our Military out Build the wall!
Build the wall, deport all illegals
But most people with a brain don't Donald, only you and your minions!
Build the Wall! Stay strong Trump!
Thank you President Trump! We are supporting you 100%. Shame on Pelosi and fellow democrats for not wanting to protect their USA citizens. Who cares who pays for the wall?  It’s costing us billions of dollars to pay for illegal immigrants NOW! They are scamming the IRS receiving thousands of dollars with fraudulent claims and IRS knows this but won’t stop it!
On Judge Janine last night she show a picture of the Angel Families holding pictures of their lost loved ones as the families were trying to get in to see schumer....he refused to see them. On the other side of the tv screen there was a picture of schumer and one of his cronies holding pictures of 2 federal employees (I presume) who have been furloughed. HOW IS GODS NAME CAN HE EQUATE THE TWO LOSSES. THAT BASTARD HAS NO CONSCIENCE.  SORRY rant over..but he made my blood boil. 😡😡😡😡
trump’s temper tantrum shut down is not helping our great country or our people....He is a disgrace....
You need a mental checkup.  Losing a child is bad hand Americans are killing more often than immigrants.  This is false equivalency. You are always lying . Your Pinocchio nose is longer than your red ties.
Why are you making harder for people who aren't white to come to our country? If you streamlined the system then a lot of the people could be legal. People who want to be here to make a living and make our country better, like the immigrants before them. Making it harder causes more people to feel like the only way out of their horrible situation is to sneak into our country. We are not a big friendly neighbor anymore. We are the big bully who lives next door who has poisoned the water and killed the parents! Our history in Central and South the United States of America has caused a lot of these people's pain and suffering. Before any of you reply with your snowflake, right wing, whining agenda, try studying about what has happened since Reagan was in office. And try using actual facts. Not Fox, Breietbart or other federalist nonsense!
Deport Melania since you hate immigrants
No wall. Better security measures are available. Experts tell you. You are such a stupid man.
🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕FUCK TRUMP THE RAPIST .....
Lara Trump I want a wall. I also wish you would see the HSUS and GREY2K for the scumbag liars they are, and break from their propaganda based destruction.  Greyhound people have lost their way of life and the dogs they love. And so many potential  future greyhound owners won't have these amazing pets. LOOK FOR THE FACTS!
....And meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi is having 3 illegals arrested for trespassing on her property. What a 2 face POS. !!!!! (Smh) 😛😛😛

Pelosi is out of touch with reality.  She must be sent for a mental evaluation.  The safety of our country is at stake.  Democrats must rebel and oust her immediately
Just go to her FB page and comment on it!
I’m just curious.  Would a wall have stopped the criminal gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, from fighting? (No) https://youtu.be/uVspqShcXSA

Dear trump and his supporters:  Just in case you forgot, in the USA, there is a process for bills to become laws.   Laws are not made by one party writing a bill, and simply expecting the other party to fall in lockstep, and sign the bill without research, debate, expert testimony, public testimony, amendments or changes, acceptable compromises and other measures.

Build the wall. It is a necessity if we want our children, their children and the future generations to have a chance at a drug free life. It will also help contain human trafficking. There will always be crime, yet this will have a crippling impact on crime. Linda, Texas
Why is anyone blaming Trump? He is at work in the White House .... Our representatives should be required to work too or no pay... I can’t tell my boss I’m not gonna do what you want or negotiate with you on what’s expected and still get paid! It is a shame that workers are caught in this but blame who is at fault, Trump has made several suggestions to open and start negotiations... I don’t know one person that does not have a fence around their property ! Secure the borders, and let people enter legally....
Pelosi and Democrats should not get a paycheck until they resolve this broken issue! Bet that would be fixed quickly.

We need barriers of some type in more areas, Nancy.  Four more American citizens dead because of one illegal immigrant.  Wake up, grow up and start thinking of the U.S. citizens instead of your own selfish fears of irritating your socialist congressmen and women.

There are more people who want a border wall then who do not! Immigrants who have come to this country do the front door want border walls. The only reason why the Democrats do not want a border wall is so that illegals can come here and vote Democrat so that they can turn this amazing country into a s******* socialist country. We need a civil war to make this stop

That hag isn't going to listen to anyone  that wants the best for all Americans. She is so delusional in her way of thinking yet she has security and walls that keep people out.  We all want security for ourselves and our families because too many nut jobs out there ready to pounce and take what isn't theirs. Why is it so hard to understand what our President is wanting? God help us all.

My heart goes out to the Angel moms for the loss of their family members...regardless of the circumstances. It's a shame Trump is using their pain to further his agenda. How many of the parents whose children were killed in the last 2 years by American citizens has he met. The parents of the children in school shootings, the innocents killed by police. He had no problem parading Bill Clinton's "victims" around when it benefited his agenda..but how many real victims of sexual crimes including trafficking has he met.....how many of the families going without pay during this shutdown has he met? 800,000 plus their families are at risk...he does nothing to save them.... Failure does not look good for the leader of this country...

No to Donnie Trump's vanity wall! Donnie Trump sign the bipartisan legislation to reopen the government and pay our first responders their earned salaries! We know you like to walk away from responsibilities and not pay salaries to workers you owe! How many times did you declare bankruptcy and stiff employees? I think the shutdown is your way of trying to prevent congressional oversight! It's not going to work Donnie!
My total opinion about Nancy Pelosi and why she does not want the wall is because behind the scenes I believe she's working with the drug cartels just like the other Democrats that are involved and not wanting the wall because if a wall goes up that's less money they will be receiving from the drug cartel from bringing in the drugs into our country I think she's also my opinion a part of the human trafficking that's going on in this country they don't want to give up all the illegal money blood money that they're getting off these drug cartels the people involved in the human trafficking so we'll never see the wall cuz they will fight to the end because they will be losing millions and millions of dollars every year just my opinion

Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

I’m currently watching a tv show called  border force America’s gate keepers. You should be ashamed as you are locking up unaccompanied children crossing the border from Mexico, I understand that you don’t want or need drugs and weapons crossing the border, but these are innocent children, and you decide to lock them up. Shame on you trump 😡  You are the most corrupt person currently on this planet, you need to be taken out of your position, and very soon
Although the Trump administration has called immigration at the southern U.S. border a “crisis” that has a deleterious effect on public safety, unauthorized border crossings are currently the lowest they have been in decades and studies have consistently disproved links between immigration and crime. Further most of the families who crossed during enforcement of Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy were charged with misdemeanors.https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/have-undocumented-killed-63000-us-9-11/

Mr. President, you went on tv yesterday and attempted to negotiate the safety, security and sovereignty of the United States. These are NON-NEGOTIABLE🇺🇸.  BUILD THE WALL. You work for the American people, not for the "right" of illegal aliens. It was also made clear yesterday on national television that Democrat "leaders" represent the illegal aliens, not the American people. Impeach them. Furthermore, an estimated 22 million + illegal aliens are already in the United States. This proves without exception that having NO WALL DOES NOT WORK!!!  AGAIN, BUILD THE WALL. 🇺🇸 #MAGA

Let's not forget 3 things. 1. A bipartisan DACA deal was already on the table when he walked away from it. 2. The shutdown started under a REPUBLICAN Congress. 3. The only person keeping the government shut down right now is Mitch McConnell, who refuses to hold a vote.

Places like your Mar-A-Largo which hires illegals should be given stiff penalties. If places like Trump Enterprises are given huge fines for hiring them they will stop entering the US.

Spare us your bullshit please Donald.  You've had two years and have done NOTHING.  This is an obvious sham to distract from the investigation AT YOUR DOORSTEP.
What I want is Donald Trump to develop a basic understanding of the pros and cons of erecting additional barriers along the southern border. It is easy to repeat what you have said in the past, instead of developing that understanding. If you can be educated, start to try to understand what will be required to ensure border security - instead of spending millions of tax-payer money on a worthless campaign primise that will never achieve the objective.

If not for the protection of the Office of the Presidency, Donald J Trump would have been arrested and there would be a mugshot of him for HISTORY to record...  https://www.wonkette.com/relax-everyone-donald-trump-is-still-a-f-cking-criminal
Seriously?! Work permits and social security numbers for illegals so we can attain the border security we want and demand?! NO! Do not cave to the dems!!! You KNOW what we the people want and deserve!
No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.   STOP hurting our own citizens - it is IMMORAL.

Partisan people like myself can defend our party and our elected officials for their occasional missteps, but my conservative friends are finally starting to express disgust at their Republican Party and how it does not represent them or American values anymore with these scandals recently in the news:  1. The slow unfolding of the Robert Mueller investigation proving Russian assistance to the Trump campaign. 2. Maria Butina, a Russian spy who infiltrated the NRA to redirect a $30 million contribution from Russia to the Trump campaign.  3. Wisconsin and Michigan Republicans dismantling democracy as a lame-duck power because they lost an election.  4. Election fraud in North Carolina that totally eclipses anything any other group has ever done — to the point they realize they will have to repeat the election.  5. The local Tarrant County GOP attack against one of their own Republicans for being Muslim — totally anti-American and ignoring our Constitution.  6. The Texas GOP's attack on our LGBT citizens with ridiculous bathroom bills that are being resurrected for 2019.  To think that the biggest scandal of the Obama administration was the fake story he was born in Kenya.
Stay strong Mr. President. The majority of the American people are with you. TRUMP 2020.
I have the opportunity to share with you the wise advice=if you want me to.My heart aches for the safety of world civilization=but I am very poor financially.You might want to give me some personal help =as a charity for the orphans I'm raising.Write to me, do you have the desire to provide me with financial assistance?
The establishment Republicans and Democrats are paid by globalist to stop the wall from being built.  No matter what you do or offer them, they are going to hate the President.  BUILD THE WALL because your refusal to build it will cause those that supported you to walk away from you.

America must have border security which a wall is a major part! We have seen lying politicians for years from both parties promise border security since Regan! We are sick of being lied to. We have your back, stand strong.
Be careful with how you treat People
Nancy knows we want the wall..is she in charge ? Is she in the White House? No ? Then what are we waiting for ? Stop prolonging this circus of the left.Prove to the country that she is irrelevant..
Please list the laws that citizens can ignore and get a pass for breaking. I’ll wait. Hussein Obama’s dreamers are America’s nightmare. Deport them all.
Mother your children calling you long distance answer please mother we got discriminated again .please help them
You only want a huge monument to your ego.  It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
U.S. citizens with guns kill more people, but all you’ve got for them is “thoughts and prayers”. Why aren’t the families of school shooting victims “Angel Families”? What about the families of all victims of all the shootings that occur every single day, regardless of the citizenship of whoever kills them?  Truth is, you have no more sympathy for these families than you do for anybody else. They are just pawns in your ongoing power play.
Actually, Trump is probably a BIGGER law breaker than ANY illegal.
Nancy is a Soros paid traitor...you will have to bypass her!
When you salute an northern Korean general, bow to a Saudi Prince and don't not question a KGB president and does everything he tells you on a dime. You're not a Fkin American president.
And most of America is with you.
Who are these angle families? Like you "have an angle to spread your partisan bullshit? The only angel family are those family's shattered by police violence. You don't care about actual issues though.  Just fabricating fear to spend your ignorance.
Obama has a Wall and much more than that around their house.  We the Tax Payers are paying for it. https://youtu.be/tT8sNIgF1oA
Putin, Pence, McConnell, Deripaska and Trump walk into a bar. There is no punchline. Your conned trumpsters are the punchline. You were duped by a man with 5th grade vocabulary.
NATIONAL EMERGENCY 🚨 NATIONAL EMERGENCY 🚨 NATIONAL EMERGENCY 🚨  Don’t let that traitor stop you from protecting America .   BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL !
Sir, that sounds comforting to American,s,dont mind enemies of progress,the democrats,americans are feeling the impact of your work ability.
You cannot have border security without a strong physical barrier.  Do you remember 9/11?  We've gotten too complacent.  Do we need another terror attack to get you people to understand that?
@realDonaldTrump To all of the great people who are working so hard for your Country and not getting paid I say, THANK YOU - YOU ARE GREAT PATRIOTS! We must now work together, after decades of abuse, to finally fix the Humanitarian, Criminal & Drug Crisis at our Border. WE WILL WIN BIG!

A wall isn’t going to stop climate change which does far more damage to America than immigrants...yet you do everything you can to defund efforts to fight climate change while wasting money on a wall that can be easily circumvented. 🙄

WE NEED TO START THE TRUMP PARTY AS A PRIMARY NEW OPPOSITION PARTY AND LEAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THUS MAKING REPUBLICAN PARTY ITSELF THE THIRD PARTY. WE CAN USE THIS NEW OPPOSITION PARTY STRATEGICALLY TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS. IF TRUMP VOTERS WALK AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THERE IS NO REPUBLICAN PARTY.

Gary,you must not live by the boarder?Tell your Nancy to meet with President Trump,in stead of taking all her vacations.The shutdown is in Nancy hands.

What a joke of a president you shut down the government now people like myself can’t get paid what a clown 🤡
This is now the Chuckles and Nonsensy shutdown. They refuse to negotiate, refuse to even discuss and debate, refuse to use the same rhetoric they used in 2013 that there is a crisis at the border. This is the Schummer Shakedown of the federal workers, and the Pelosi putdown of federal workers where she chooses illegals over their jobs.

How about you tell MEXICO you want the wall.
Please resign. You are neither fit, nor well. Children were kidnapped because of you. You will get what you deserve.
YOU ALSO PROMISED OR MADE A PLEDGE THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR THE DAMN WALL "NOT" THAT YOU WOULD HOLD 800,000 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES HOSTAGE IN ORDER TO GET YOUR DIAPERS CHANGED!
So Stumpy, if you want to secure the southern border with your folly of a big beautiful wall then explain how 367 refugees were able to tunnel under your magnificent all? And, not one word about the 1 million Federal employees and their families who have had to suffer because of your petty partisan politics. Yesterday afternoon you sounded desperate and you appeared to be weak. It's time for you to resign!

America is willing to come together and raise the money out of pocket if someone would get something legitimate started!
President Trump asked Pelosi if he stopped the shutdown today would she be willing to negotiate the wall in thirty days and she said no.
use  FBI and CIA and Police to stop drug trafficing these criminals break law and commit murder
I'm so sorry Mr. President but the "art of the deal" only works when you are working with sane people. The DNC is now a matter of the lunatics are running the asylum. We must not ever let these people win, ever. Where was the RNC during the mid terms, they did no get out the vote efforts, no voter registration, and did nothing to stop ballot harvesting in nursing homes, and did not challenge provisional ballots. The RNC fails us continually.

Exclusiveness is a form of white arrogance !!!
Since Pelosi and Schumer refused to meet with Angel Families in their offices, BRING THEM TO THE STOTU AND LET THEM TELL THEIR STORIES.
Careful conservatives. TROLL Is a new word to get banned on FB. 72 hour ban for saying troll.
Trump,  Anne coulter should negotiate with Democrats.  She seems to be your boss as well as Hannity and rush. Low life people.
Mendoza was killed by a drunk driver as were 10,496 other people in America that year. Wouldn't banning alcohol be a better argument since in that same year only one person was killed by a drunk illegal immigrant.
Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
You bring out the absolute worst in people
You bring out the absolute worst in people
So do your JOB! Use your authority to send the military to secure the border and build the wall! The military just got a huge 745 Billion dollar budget! The non secure border presents the threat of terrorist crossings, and no telling how many already have, while we're being jerked around on the wall issue! This is a matter of National Security, and reclaiming our Sovereignty as a free and independent Constitutional Republic! You do not need congressional approval to secure the border! This is a matter of National Security and the safety of the American public! Stop jerking us around!
Tell Trump to resign someone make a pledge!
"A shutdown falls on the President's lack of leadership. He can't even control his party and get people together in a room. A shutdown means the President is weak" -Donald Trump, 2013.

You naver did any good in your sad life pig
Establishment Republicans are paid by Charles Koch/others not to support building the wall.  BUILD THE FREEGGIN WALL OR LOSE YOUR SUPPORTERS.
Hello, Do you wish to be rich, famous, wealthy and powerful and have numerous benefits? Be part of this elite organization called Illuminati filled with world leaders, business authorities, innovators, artists, and other influential members of this planet....to apply for membership message us now with your name, age, country.   Your welfare is our aim  With us you financially free and stable.
Where's the Mexican cash?  $0.02?  Where's the "greatest negotiator"?  We all know that hurting and holding millions of American's hostage is the strategy of a simple minded fake! Extorsionist! Humpty dumpty trumpty will fall 2019!
..and while tyrants like Pelosi are trying to steal our gun rights by saying if we give you a wall, there will not be a need for guns, just remember the 2nd amendment wasn't intended for defending yourself from others, but for defending yourself from a tyrannical government!!!!!
I'm telling Nancy and Chuck to keep knocking your demented ideas out of the stadium. We all want border security that actually works. Walls didn't work during medieval times protecting castles and they don't work to this day. You can go over, under, around or through ANY wall. A wall still needs manpower and technology power to be secure. You're all a bunch of uninformed children of immigrants, EVERY ONE OF YOU!!!!
Send me a friend request.
Maybe. Trump should fine everyone who doesn't want the wall...kinda like Obama did with Obama care !!!

#TRE45ON!  You lack a fundamental understanding of America’s documented ideals.  That makes you dangerous.  And it means you have to go.  Impeachment, indictment, incarceration, and annulment loom larger than ever.  Soon...
Perhaps you should Rephrase that statement to say... " I will not stop till All American's are Safe and Secure." rather than just the Freakin Boarders Donald J. Trump
you also said you would show your taxes.  Mexico would pay for the wall.  Not enough time to list all 7,538 lies.
At the cost of making the average American people suffer right, your wall is NOT more important than American lives. You're basically engaging in war with the middle and lower class and pray they bring it to your doorstep.. remember there's only a couple hundred of you but millions of us!!
She is a reptile.
Go President Trump! Be strong and courageous for the Lord your God is with you!
Yeah but you don't give a damm about all the government people that YOU PUT OUT OF WORK, BECAUSE OF YOUR TANTRUM OVER THE WALL. PLEASE STEP DOWN MR FAKE PRESIDENT

Why negotiate with this idiot? He changes what he wants daily!!! Who ever said he was a great deal maker? Oh yeah, he did. That has been proven false!!! Last year he could have gotten 25 billion for his wall. All he had to do was give in on DACA. Now he wants 5.8 billion in exchange for DACA. If he is on the other side of negotiations you have to be happy. You’ll be able to get anything from this BABY!!!
If Trump gets his wall, he holds his campaign promise and will probably get elected again because of it. This is why the Democrats are not funding the wall. They care more about bringing Trump down, then national security.  They are going to rely on the youth to start voting in 2020. The youth want to start a revolution and can't even start a lawnmower 🙄

Seeking a Declaratory Judgment... The minority leader in the Senate and the Speaker of the House have made it clear that they will not budget funds requested by the President regarding the southern border and the safety of American citizens and legal residents of the U.S.  Under the Constitution the President has the obligation of protecting American citizens and legal residents in the country.  Further, the minority leader in the Senate and Speaker in the House have made it clear that not only won’t they support what the President says is necessary but will oppose the President in court. Therefore, we recommend that the President through the Attorney General, seek a declaratory judgment from Federal judiciary on an expedited basis that he is entitled under the constitution to use available funds to undertake protective actions along the southern border.

Democrats as of this morning will not talk with any Angel families. Terrible, you don't have to be on either side to see that Democrats have there own agenda in getting power no matter what it takes. They're not America's friend, and if you stand for the Constitution of the United States their not your friend either. And I might add there not Christianity's friend either.  Reading and researching from the early years tells their true story about there agenda to change America.   The Christians will win this war in the end though when the ultimate Holy War breaks out in future time. God will always protect the United States Of America. O:) 🙏💒

Robin Barnhill, but since you say Trump can’t be trusted, then you accept you couldn’t trust him to reopen the government either? That means you also accept a very long government shutdown
Robin Barnhill, Democrats would screw up a wet dream if they understood what one was
Bob Segal LOL nice try.  Trump is a liar and untrustworthy

Dear President Donald Trump unlimited amounts of Thank you to you , love ❤️ you ! you are the only Billionaire President in the History of the USA who protect the safety security and interests of the citizens of the USA only! Absolutely no compromise on building of the southern borders wall! USA is unable even to take care of its very own citizens!
FACT: A WALL IS NOT SECURE: 1. Despite a wall, on Monday last week, 376 Central American immigrants dug their way under the wall and illegally entered Arizona. 2. DHS testing on wall prototypes showed the steel slats can easily be cut with an ordinary household saw. IT IS NOT SECURE. It is only a campaign promise.
The guy that ran a Campaign about AMERICA FIRST America First America First America First  Does away with 800k American JOBS that held key positions in our government that made us all a little safer. The Heartbeat of America.  Then realizing he had to have a few hundred thousand working. ORDERED them back to work with NO PAY. Like they are his subjects working under him in a MONARCHY. . America First for a promise to the people just does not jell with his actions.  I say, put them all back to work with back pay. Then when back to work, Talk about spending money on the MEXICANS.
If he can't go down in History as the best President.  He would rather go down as the worst.  It's all about what HE can do. If you haven't figured that out, you are the problem.
Shannon M Kent was killed in Syria this week by the ISIS Trump claims is defeated. Two years of lies and one manufactured crisis after another .....as for agenda , still waiting for much better and much cheaper healthcare.
Don't give in Build the wall the CA Dems need to get there state in order before they talk about the way President Trump is doing.
Meanwhile, mainstream news outlets are not reporting that homelessness is “exploding” out on the west coast.  For instance, we are being told that there are “1000's of unauthorized tent camps” in the city of Seattle alone…  Housing prices are soaring here thanks to the tech industry, but the boom comes with a consequence: A surge in homelessness marked by 1000+ unauthorized tent camps in parks, under bridges, on freeway medians and along busy sidewalks. The liberal city is trying to figure out what to do.  But I thought that the Seattle economy was doing so well.  I guess not.  Down in San Diego, they are actually scrubbing the sidewalks with bleach because the growing homeless population is spreading hepatitis A everywhere…  San Diego now scrubs its sidewalks with bleach to counter a deadly hepatitis A outbreak. In Anaheim, 1000+ people sleep along a bike path in the shadow of Angel Stadium. Organizers in Portland lit incense at an outdoor food festival to cover up the stench of urine in a parking lot where vendors set up shop.  Over the past two years, “at least 10 cities or municipal regions in California, Oregon and Washington” have declared a state of emergency because homelessness has gotten so far out of control.  Nice Job Nancy?  Lori Williams posted 1/19/2019-  We have a huge homeless population here in the Antelope Valley, California's high desert. Every under/overpass, vacant field, and any place they can pitch a tent...not to mention store fronts. They're begging in parking lots, gas stations, medians, and even coming into the business where I work. Our homeless shelter closed for lack of funds, and I won't go out after dark anymore. If they do manage to move them, hazmat has to come and clean up after them. But hey, let's allow even more people in that we can't care for, sad.  -------------------- That is all.....
Trump`s so-called fighting has only created a major crisis at our southern border....Now he is trying to use "Angel Families" to correct the crisis HE created....It takes a special type of low-life like Trump to do something like that low...

President Trump,  if you read the comments of your postings then you know you have many Americans who are so incredibly proud to call you "our President".  Thank you for all you are doing to keep America safe. May God continue to direct your administration and keep you and your beautiful family safe.

As Trump drags us into week 5 of the #TrumpShutdown, it's important to remember that he is holding 800,000 patriotic American workers hostage because he wants us to pay $5.7 billion dollars for a wall he promised repeatedly that Mexico would pay for!  Tell the Senate to pass the House spending bills and re-open the government here: http://bit.ly/2TtVTwr #NoWall
imma telling nancy i want to see your tax returns...and whats up with all this money your making on the backs of the us taxpayer....among other things

You do not Negotiate with a president when he has the country hostage!!
What did TRUMP pay this stooge@
No Donald, this is a phony "crisis" you created and have continually lied about. Get Mexico to pay for your imbecilic wall like you said you would. You told the Democrats that you would proudly close the government and not blame them for it. What happened to both of those things? This is your mess. You are solely to blame.
Relax, the shutdown will be over in a few days.  Pres Trump needed a 30 day waiting period before he could fire all the useless employees and saboteurs in the bloated bureaucracy.
Mr. President, 800,000 Federal employees and their families are being harmed by no fault of their own.  It has been 30 days or more since many of these government employees have been paid and many are required to work without pay.  That means paying for gas to go back and forth to work.  They are being held hostage in a political battle not of their making.  Many of these government employees work to secure our border, now without pay.  Please end this shutdown.  I support you on a strong border, but this is hurting our fellow Americans.

Have ALL you whinging Remoaners read the Lisbon Treaty, if you haven’t, here’s a taster for you!  WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE LISBON TREATY, THE TREATY THAT COMES INTO FORCE 2020, ITS WORSE THAN THE SO CALLE DEAL, IF 99% OF THE BRITISH THINK THIS THE DEAL IS BAD JUST LOOK AT THE LISBON TREATY. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW, LEAVERS AND REMAIMERS..“What will actually happen if we stay in the EU” is a question no remainer will ever answer but here it is warts and all.  1: The UK along with all existing members of the EU lose their abstention veto in 2020 as laid down in the Lisbon Treaty when the system changes to that of majority acceptance with no abstentions or veto’s being allowed. 2: All member nations will become states of the new federal nation of the EU by 2022 as clearly laid out in the Lisbon treaty with no exceptions or veto’s. 3: All member states must adopt the Euro by 2022 and any new member state must do so within 2 years of joining the EU as laid down in the Lisbon treaty. 4: The London stock exchange will move to Frankfurt in 2020 and be integrated into the EU stock exchange resulting in a loss of 200,000 plus jobs in the UK because of the relocation. (This has already been pre-agreed and is only on a holding pattern due to the Brexit negotiations, which if Brexit does happen, the move is fully cancelled - but if not and the UK remains a member it’s full steam ahead for the move.) 5: The EU Parliament and ECJ become supreme over all legislative bodies of the UK. 6: The UK will adopt 100% of whatever the EU Parliament and ECJ lays down without any means of abstention or veto, negating the need for the UK to have the Lords or even the Commons as we know it today. 7: The UK will NOT be able to make its own trade deals. 8: The UK will NOT be able to set its own trade tariffs. 9 The UK will NOT be able to set its own trade quotas. 10: The UK loses control of its fishing rights 11: The UK loses control of its oil and gas rights 12: The UK loses control of its borders and enters the Schengen region by 2022 - as clearly laid down in the Lisbon treaty 13: The UK loses control of its planning legislation 14: The UK loses control of its armed forces including its nuclear deterrent 15: The UK loses full control of its taxation policy 16: The UK loses the ability to create its own laws and to implement them 17: The UK loses its standing in the Commonwealths 18: The UK loses control of any provinces or affiliated nations e.g.: Falklands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar etc 19: The UK loses control of its judicial system 20: The UK loses control of its international policy 21: The UK loses full control of its national policy 22: The UK loses its right to call itself a nation in its own right. 23: The UK loses control of its space exploration program 24: The UK loses control of its Aviation and Sea lane jurisdiction  25: The UK loses its rebate in 2020 as laid down in the Lisbon treaty 26: The UK’s contribution to the EU is set to increase by an average of 1.2bn pa and by 2.3bn pa by 2020 This is the future that the youths of today think we stole from them?  They should be on their knees thanking us for saving them from being turned into Orwellian automatons, if we escape from control of the EU.

So I know that if you want to buy a box of cereal, you have to have a voter ID and that Donald gave our soldiers a 10% pay raise. Mexican drug smugglers throw sacks of drugs over the fence and our people get hit on the head with 60 pounds of stuff.  I know the deep state has access to weather weapons capable of not only creating tornadoes but also moving them around, on demand.  I know that the government is using chemicals in order to turn people gay, using a mysterious "gay bomb" devised by the Pentagon. I know that no one died at Sandy Hook Elementary School because the Uniform Crime Reports showed no murders in Newtown for 2012 and the “victims” were child actors.  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/alex-jones-5-most-disturbing-ridiculous-conspiracy-theories.htmlAlex Jones' 5 most disturbing and ridiculous conspiracy theoriescnbc.com

Nearly 60,000 immigrants with arrest records -- including 10 accused of murder -- have been allowed to stay in the United States under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed Monday.  According to DHS, 59,786 DACA recipients have been arrested while in the U.S. -- approximately 7.8 percent of all who have been approved to remain in this country under the program since it was created in 2012. Of those, 53,792 were arrested before their most recent request for a so-called "grant of deferred action" was approved. Another 7,814 were arrested after their request was approved.
Obama shoved ACA down our throats..so you need to return the favor and build the wall..my insurance is now 2100 per month for a house hold of 2.how can anyone afford 24000 in health insurance.. it's the first time in 55 years I have not own health insurance.. and I don't even have any preexisting condition.. this is crazy.so shut the government down as long as need be.please get the health insurance under control.fire all of Congress and start over and make health insurance affordable again..

If you defund planned parenthood you could pay for the wall in 30 years without even changing the budget... just saying.
Democrats are trying to get people back to work and paid because their allegiance is to America. Republicans have showed they don't care about workers because their allegiance is to Donald Trump.
Democrat want’s to be like communist that they care nothing but their on way. They are working only to cater illegal and big drug dealer. Those are the people are in their list. So the Democrat voters  they elected them Demorats congressman just to punch them and laugh at the voters. Unless they all cheat.
You made a pledge Mexico will pay for the wall too!
Liar
Now he wants to negotiate if you would stop holding American people at hostage then maybe a lot will get done. I do admit that something has to be done with our Borders he has great ideas but he's going about it the wrong way stop holding American people hostage. In the shutdown.

People keep talking about the executive order but it isn't that easy. Even if he does it, the Dems, Nancy and Chuck will fight it and mingle with some Dem judge who will just throw it out. Trump is trying to do it the mature way hoping Nancy and Chucky will come around and come to their senses but that probably just isn't going to happen. In their eyes "Trump wins" in that case, and they just can't have that.

The Democrats have a plan to fix the immigration problem, Trump just wants a wall
Newsflash. Illegal immigration can be solved without an expensive wall in which the money can be better used. Get tighter security, 24-hour surveillance, identify problems areas and times, and/or create a special task force designed just for that purpose. If that doesn’t work ask NASA since they figured how to fly to the moon surely this is an easy feat.  Take that money and cure cancer, improve public education, fund studies for mental health and substance abuse, or even fund St. Jude so they don’t have to beg strangers on tv.

Donald Trump declared today (Jan. 17) he was grounding Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s upcoming trip to visit troops in Afghanistan “in light of the 800,000 Great American workers not receiving pay,” alluding to the expense of flying military aircraft there.  Hours later, his wife Melania Trump was on board a US military plane to Palm Beach, Florida, where the couple have a private club, on a flight that Quartz calculates cost US taxpayers $35,000.
Trump to Mexico: Climb my wall and you get to stay #AmnestyDon
Trump cares about a few specific dead people who support his talking points, but the vast majority don't interest him. Like the people killed by people who need mental health care, the people killed by guns, the people who die because they can't afford their medicine, and so on.
Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the professional politicians are enemies of the United States and should be held accountable.

DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old. Here are 30 ways Americans are feeling the pain:  1. 450,000 public workers are being made to work without pay, including members of the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, Border Patrol, FBI, and Secret Service. 2. 350,000 public workers have been temporarily laid off. 3. Tens of thousands of federal contractors have been laid off for a month, including janitors, security guards, and cafeteria workers. They are losing up to $200 million a day. It is unlikely that they will ever receive pay for the time they have missed. 4. Nearly 10,000 companies that do business with the U.S. government are losing money, according to the Washington Post. 5. Pop-up food banks have opened up to feed unpaid government workers. 6. The four week shutdown is costing the U.S. $200 million a day, or almost $6 billion so far according to analysis by The New York Times. 7. Unpaid TSA workers have been calling in 'sick' or quitting, leading to longer security lines and missed flights. Some airports have begun closing terminals. 8. The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9. Air Traffic Controllers, who were already suffering a 30-year staffing low, have been feeling the strain of going unpaid. Some have begun quitting. 10. With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21. The FTC's identity theft reporting system is shut down. 22. Student loans are being delayed as universities are unable to verify parents' income with the IRS 23. Small Business Administration loans have been delayed. 24. Domestic violence shelters that receive federal funds have been forced to cut services. 25. Highway and transit projects are being delayed or canceled. 26. Wildfire preparations in western states are delayed. 27. The National Hurricane Center's research has been delayed 28. The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo are closed. 29. Funding for Section 8 housing assistance has lapsed, placing low-income families at risk of eviction. 30. Civil cases in federal court have been delayed. Lawsuits against Donald Trump in federal court are on hold.
We’re just at the 30 Day mark of the government shutdown. Once that happens, President Trump can get rid of or downsize departments & programs that waste our money and resources through Fraud and Abuse:  Government investigators and private watchdog groups uncover fraud and abuse in the federal budget on a regular basis. There are three common problems: ineligible individuals and businesses receiving benefits, bureaucrats who abuse the public trust and members of Congress who abuse their privileges for private or political gain. In the first type of problem, fraud artists are attracted to the government because there are billions of dollars in contracts and grants to take advantage of. Here are some examples uncovered by the GAO and other investigators in recent years: ● Medicare. Erroneous and fraudulent payments to Medicare providers cost $20 billion annually. The program is vulnerable to an array of different scams such as inflated billings, claims for phantom patients and phantom procedures, and billings for services that are not supposed to be covered. The fraud goes on year after year and Medicare administrators are unwilling or unable to stop it. Experts are predicting that the huge new Medicare prescription drug plan will be particularly susceptible to fraud and abuse. ● Medicaid. As with Medicare, inflated billings and bogus claims under Medicaid, waste billions of dollars each year. The GAO found $1 billion of fraud in California’s portion of Medicaid alone. After a year-long investigation, the New York Times reported in 2005 that from 10 to 40 percent of the state’s annual Medicaid budget of $45 billion may be siphoned off in fraud and abuse. The paper found that outrageously bold rip-offs have proliferated due to the indifference of New York and federal policymakers. ●Medicaid-Nursing Home Benefits. These benefits are supposed to be for the poor, but financial consultants help higher-income seniors hide their assets in order to qualify. This scam imposes $10 billion in extra costs on taxpayers each year. ● Post-9/11 Grants #1 Much of an $8 billion federal program to help repair damaged New York offices near Ground Zero ended up going to build luxury condos and to projects outside Lower Manhattan. ● Post-9/11 Grants #2 A federal program to hand out free air conditioners to New Yorkers affected by the collapse of the World Trade Center ballooned in cost from $15 million to $100 million because of management failures and bogus claims. ● Housing Subsidies. Overpayments in federal rental housing subsidies cost $2 billion each year. ●HeadStart. This $7 billion program is rife with misuse of funds.  ● Social Security. Social Security pays out about $1 billion in fraudulent disability benefits each year. ● Farm Subsidies. The Department of Agriculture pays out millions of dollars—perhaps as much as half a billion dollars—of improper farm subsidies each year. ● Food Stamps. This program pays out about $1 billion annually in erroneous and fraudulent benefits, although problems have been reduced in recent years. ● Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA has a reputation for being sloppy with its disaster aid. It tends to hand out money indiscriminately after hurricanes and other disasters, and it loses millions of dollars to fraud because of its poor management. ● Earned Income Tax Credit. Almost one-third of EITC payments—about $9 billion annually—are erroneous or fraudulent.
“Trump suckered the Democrats into a battle royale over the southern border wall Trump has proposed.  By refraining from declaring a national emergency and then building the wall (with Department of Defense funds saved from the withdrawal from Syria), Trump can simply bypass Congress.  He can order the Army Corps of Engineers to build it.”
these families need to get more FaceTime. But we know the MSM will try to keep their stories from the public.

TRUMP needs to pull the obama...at 1 minute past midnight on Friday Executive Order the funds to build border wall & massive security updates...as it will turn into human crisis once the liberals instigated caravan reaches US BORDER TOWNS!
Stay the course Mr. President.  The Democrats are playing partisan politics.  They will put our country’s security and sovereignty at risk to serve their political agenda.
Is Pelosi in a drunken stupor that she can’t hear people telling her “Build the wall”?

Since Israel built their wall, terrorism in the Jewish state has decreased by 99% which proves that walls work, even the least intelligent among us understand that.
Except the wall won't work.
As President, you made a promise TO ALL Americans, not just your far-right base.
Ann Coulter‏Verified account @AnnCoulter · 16h16 hours ago   Trump's solution: Let's just amnesty them
Why is most people against the wall think about all the job security it will bring to the people in those states
Dude is trying to protect USA not get rich on us. Give him the darn money to do it.
Nothing says unbiased reporting like your daughter in law reporting from the Eagles Nest- oops- I mean Trump tower

WHAT DO YOU WANT???????????
Fred Leenhouts democrats only condone violence they themselves create to incite panic so they can continue to take away privileges that was never supposed to be able to be amended. I am of course referring to our Bill of rights that they have in fact effectively changed to a bill of privileges that they can take away at anytime without notice, cause, or due process of any kind.

Pelosi is not going to let Trump have the wall, she's not going to negotiate. He should give her 1 more week to come to the table & if she doesn't he needs to do it on his own. DO NOT OPEN THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL WE HAVE THE WALL. NO MORE NEGOTIATION, SHE HAD MADE HER POINT, NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP NEEDS TO DO WHAT HE HAS TO WITH OUR WITHOUT HER.
Propaganda for the trump regime. Regimes only exist in dictatorships. You have no idea how to govern a nation. You only know how to RIP off customers, workers, and how to sell snake oil to your cult45.  Resign and make America great again and again and again (ad infinitum).
In 2020, Americans would still need you! And in 2024 you gonna have to rerun.

I am from Australia and have watched some of the cnn news reports and numerous other news. Wow! There are clear and present agendas with reporters. Many are not reporting the news in an unbiased way. The way they accuse the President of so many things is appalling. I believe if people over there are accusing the leader of the country without evidence of what they are saying, should be charged with slander. It seems they are accusing with only opinions..theirs!  Wow...show some respect people.
You also made a pledge to all Americans that their #2A rights were safe.
What about the angel moms whom have also had their children MURDERED by gun violence? Where’s your voice for them?? Is it about money? The money you all receive from gun manufacturers? The crisis is within our borders, and although there may be a crisi at the southern border, children, AMERICAN children are being murdered inside their classrooms!!
President Donald J. Trump if you give in and give up your given up on us n that includes the already thousands of immigrants who already snuck here.
Democrats want POWER...nothing matters but POWER....they will sacrifice their own for POWER OVER THE PEOPLE......
Nonsensical to the issue.
I wish you would put all this fear mongering behind our students who are more at risk then anyone. But that's right you really don't give a crap about them
OPINION ONLY. MEDIA CORRUPTION? Let’s face it! And what to do about it?   We have a corrupt left-wing media with an agenda (to destroy our President?).  Transparency of ownership of the media is a must! NOW! We have a handful of media owners. Yes, including Newspapers (who owns yours?).   Our hometown newspapers are owned by a paltry few mostly left-wingers (Gannett?, etc. owner of USA Today+) also with an agenda hell-bent on removing President Trump?  Truth in reporting does not appear to be part of their Business Model? Monopolies?  FINANCING MODELS ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE ISSUE OF OWNERSHIP.   PUBLIC & PRIVATE ownership, the media sector’s growing reliance on non-traditional sources of revenue (i.e. not physical sales) makes it vulnerable to undue influence through new funding sources.   Whether state subsidies or private contribution, media companies’ reliance on funding streams TIED TO SPECIAL INTERESTS is a real challenge to the integrity of their journalism.

FAKE NEWS WITH A SPRINKLE OF OUTRIGHT LIES.
When something so rudimentary seemingly can’t be fixed we must acknowledge that it is no longer about the survival of a constitutional America, but the survival of the swamp dwellers and the club they have in Washington. #buildthewall
There are already extensive fences and barriers along the border. A new ‘wall’ (that can be tunneled under, climbed over, and sawed through) will not stop illegal immigration. Most people who don’t have legal resident status work hard and pay taxes through their paychecks and on the products they buy, yet get no medicare or social security in return. Stop the fear-mongering and posturing. Cut the crap, forget about the pointless wall, and pass a budget that rebuilds US infrastructure and improves education.
the art of the deal LOL trump cant get a deal but you think he's a clever cunning man LMAO only morons and idiots read trumps book
The art of the deal is being played out and its obvious Pelosi didn't read the book lol.How can people of this country not see how Pelosi doesn't care about her own state all she cares about is attacking Potus.
Four more Angel Families———20 year old ILLEGAL ALIEN , Martinez Guzman, was just arrested in Carson City for the murder of 4 elderly Reno and Gardernerville Nevada residents last week. This POS is suspected of murdering a beloved 80 year old couple who were prominent members of our community. He also murdered two single elderly women.......each living alone. What kind of monster preys on the most vulnerable in our society? ANSWER: AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ONE. These murders are further proof that there is a real danger having unvetted illegals in our communities. Those who insist upon open orders and sanctuary cities ....appear to have more blood on their hands this week.    BUILD THE WALL NOW.....Before any more innocent lives are taken.
If you cave and give amnesty you will lose my vote along with a majority of your voters. Stay the course Mr. President.
NO Politician should be Allowed to Leave, Be PAID, Until a Resolution is Made in the Anti-American democRATic Shutdown. Pres. Trump Should have Cancelled Pelosi's Military Return Flight. BUILD the WALL, PROTECT America/AMERICANs..
President Trump, don’t surrender the United States Capitol to Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer go there speak to the American people. We don’t care if no one shows up as long as you do don’t let them do this to you this is why we elected you because of the kind of man you are and because of the kind of strength you have! Do your speech to the nation from the US capital! Maybe the supreme court the Republicans and others will still come but even if they don’t it would be a great and awesome thing for youTo do this and we will have great respect for you as we do right now! Don’t surrender the US Capitol building that belongs to the people not Nancy or chalk! We’re praying for you!
It is not your pledge, but your method that sucks.
Demacrats only have one goal!! That is to. Bring down President Trump!! They dont care about the American people!! They are obsessed with impeaching Trump!! Finding anyway they can to do it!! That is their only goal in life!!
what  about  the  people  the  blew up  the  buiding  in ok

You ran on Mexico paying for the wall so quit asking us for money. Or are you not a man of your word.
Mother Nancy Pelosi (March 26th 1940), we want the wall - Most of Americans want the wall.  What do you want exactly? 🧛‍♂️🙋‍♂️
Letter sent. God bless President Donald J. Trump
Question: Which Party Platform is egotistical and which is Altruistic in nature? Politics are very simple to understand. There is a balance in between "The needs of the many out-way the needs of a few" AND "A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link" If we find the sweet spot in those two things we will live in heaven on earth. President Trump is thee closest we have come to this line of thinking in our history as a country.
I thought Mexico was going to pay for the wall. How many times did you get your mindless fools to chant that in your fascist rallies?

This is what the public should know but the Liberal in Washington, DC and the Media don't want you to know.  I ash America to put the Liberals out and back our President Trump in fighting for America not for the Liberals who are getting rich from US and built the WALL NOW

DACA was an Illegal Law by EO by obama who had no authority to create a Law, only Congress can create Laws and DACA was never voted on by the Congress therefore it is an Illegal law and Trump should be getting it to the SCOTUS to overturn it not give those who are in America Illegally Social Security. Period. #NODACADeal

The meeting, which took place on June 23 in Kiev between ConverDyn external link and Ukrainian officials, is another indication of Kiev's attempts to diversify its future energy needs and distance itself from Russian-produced energy, reports pro-Ukrainian news website UNIAN.
Trump, why did you confiscate the translators notes?  Did you destroy them?  Why did you order the translator not to speak with anyone from your staff?  Why did you not have any members of your staff or other American officials present during your meeting with Putin in Helsinki?  Are you in debt to or being manipulated by the Russians?  Did you direct Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump tower?  Why are you attempting to ease sanctions on Russian Oligarchs? Stopped by bi-partisan Congressional efforts.  Why do you continue to act like an asset of Russia?
God be with you . Its for damn sure, the Democrats dont care for you or this country and its citizens.
You offered nothing new, you simply suggested what you have suggested before, and that keeping Dreamers here for 3 year extension would give them time.  These are people who have jobs, education and lives to live, how does this help them plan for a future.  Angel Families... give me a break. You are a horrible negotiator, and your wall has only 29% approval by the American people. Trump Tower has its own news studio, now that is just wrong, news like that is dictator news. Spin it Trump, but the facts are still the facts.
I have the opportunity to share with you the wise advice=if you want me to.My heart aches for the safety of world civilization=but I am very poor financially.You might want to give me some personal help =as a charity for the orphans I'm raising.Write to me, do you have the desire to provide me with financial assistance?
President Trump why do congress and senate get paid during the shutdown? To be honest they should be the ones not getting paid at all till things are resolved. The shutdown should mean Pelosi and everyone else not get paid at all. The workers at the government agencies like the fbi and every where else should never be affected by this. If they want food to eat make them eat a mre during there breaks.

Prey. TRump - I hope all republicans will let people know - especially those people who elected a Democrat in the house - that They elected a phony for Border Security person / they are Open Borders at heart - Like Nancy Pelosi Border Security is just lip service to them the Dems. This is what is on display right now. They fool them that they are not like Nancy Pelosi - now these people are being fooled and being lied to
I hope and pray that you’re hands are tied over this. We are all ready to blow a f- ing cork. We have also reached our limit on this border crisis. Shut it the f-!! Down until further notice!!
Stay Strong President President Donald J. Trump
Everyone needs to call their congressman and demand that she be removed as speaker of the house. This can be done by a majority vote. This woman is a clear threat to our nations security, and is unfit to serve. PLEASE CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN AND DEMAND THAT SHE BE REMOVED!!!!!
Temmie Redoble Dunn WHAT?
Pelosi is scared to meet them,one reason why she wants President Trump to postpone his state of the nation address.President Trump don’t let her stop you the people want to hear from you!You can deliver it anywhere we still will listen to you
It’s there jobs and the RNC to start making that known to the American public. This is the type of thing that Sarah Sanders should highlight during WH Briefings.
Nancy pelosi is a republican too btw so please stop calling her a democrat...... this wall showdown is just for show because it’s the only issue her and trump differ on so they’re playing it up to the max
All bets off Trump. They do not negotiate...the rules have been made...negotiating is off the table now..they made that decision. This is National Security at issue. Envoke your power...they are clearly representatives of foreigner immigrants and elite foreign donors, but not US Citizens.

Build the damn wall !  Use crisis or military to build, or at least have large numbers of military patrol open areas.
Hang in there Mr. President. We're with you. At some point you might tell the people who aren't getting paid that it may be in their best interests to take advantage of our awesome economy to find a job in the private sector. Keep the gov't shut down, privatize those agencies that are necessary and let the departments and agencies that are proving to not be essential go away.
The socialists want the votes of illegals. That's the basis of the problem. Until we repair the voting laws in this country that problem will remain the same. Let's demand proof of US citizenship before anyone can vote. That proof cannot be anything from the DMV.
The December 2017 draft memo—which Merkley shared with NBC News after receiving it from a government whistleblower—shows that Trump administration officials wanted to deport children more quickly by denying them asylum hearings after taking them away from their parents.  "It appears that they wanted to have it both ways—to separate children from their parents but deny them the full protections generally awarded to unaccompanied children," concluded ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, who led a class-action lawsuit on behalf of migrant parents.  President Donald Trump's "child immigration strategy is immoral and comes from a dark place in the heart of this administration," Merkley declared, responding to the revelations on Twitter. "Children are NOT expendable commodities in political battles."
So what made you change your mind on immigration system mr trump , i truly suspect your caving in sir lol .. funny man you are .....
No body invite them come USA that why they alive or they die is not concern America . Why they don’t come or stay mecxico because they want welfare medical do you pay tax for them
Pelosi is not the President stopping treating her like one.  The people elected President Trump.  Build the WALL.
Like always Don the Con hasnt fullu thought this through, if the borders are closed how is he and his businesses going to hire the illegals they depend on?
how anyone says anything negative about a human who have lost lives of their loved once... Jesus Christ what's wrong with you people ? are you that brain washed and angry .. get a life. seriously get a life.  my heart goes to that mother . your son was a guardian angel on earth .

Good speech yesterday. Most people found it to be common sense, although common sense isn't very common in democrats. I would put a timeline on it though and declare an emergency if they don't react. A lot of Feds are behind you, but we can't hang on forever. Build that wall!

The bill that would have kept the government open was voted on and passed by the Senate on December 19, 2018. It was sent to the House. The House added $5.7 billion to it for the boarder wall, voted on it, passed it, sent it back to the Senate. It has sat there on Mitch McConnell’s desk where it was last considered on January 2, 2019 with McConnell refusing to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote. This shutdown is squarely on the shoulders of Mitch McConnell.  , wtf
Not happening. The US does not negotiate with terrorists, this man is holding the American people hostage and the wall is his ransom.

What can we do to help "our" citizens who are without right now, because "our" government sure isn't gonna do anything... Inslaving people... People "protesting"/"begging" to work because we live in a system of "work" and "money". vs self reliance, know how and bartering... Please write... Do not let your voice go unheard!!! If we don't fight for us... No one will??? The time is now... I guess inslaving people, while watching them lose everything, go hungry and possibly die without medical for appropriate medical care... Is how "he" was going to make America great again. Is it not enough that our school system suffer and we are one of the most illiterate countries on the planet, but now you want to cut funding. The rich will remain rich and poor will remain poor, no matter how great your credit is the 1% is running it's own people (per usual) into the ground.... Literally!!! #Speak #Amendments #OneLove #Freedom #SilenceKills #OneForAll
Oh so much bullshit. All security agencies are working without pay to protect Americans and Trump plays political games for a wall that Mexico was promised to pay for. How many lie can a Trump supporter support? Millions because they can't read about history.
Build a dome. Only way to keep America safe, and military patrolling g the streets like in Israel.
The only pledge he made is to some big corporation that they can build the wall

Pelosi was just getting ready to leave the Country for a family vacation on your dime!  All the while people aren’t getting paid!   Build the Wall Now!
Trump and Republicans had $25 Billion for their wall last time but it wasn't good enough! Trump wanted Stephen Miller's (Fantasy) 4 point immigration plan that even most Republicans said was too extremist. Trump got himself into this mess by owning it and we aint saving him! Republicans in the Senate will have to fall on their swords to open the government by bucking Trump. Otherwise they can rot in hell till the next election.

You have my full support. The disrespect of people infiltrating of southern border illegally needs to be punished. They laugh at the US’s weak laws and enforcement. The Democrats are complicit. Why? Because building up the obedient, completely dependent underclass is how they stay in power. Half the population keeps voting them in. The fix is in!

Donald J. Trump‏Verified account @realDonaldTrump   Don’t forget, we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly, and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building, after all, is what I do best, even when money is not readily available!........Of course it would cost less if you're not building a concrete wall from sea to sea....DUH.   Also, Contractors have replaced miles of dilapidated fencing with more modern alternatives, but they haven't built barriers anywhere they didn't exist already. When money isn't available you just don't pay the contractor, like you have done previously in your life.
Thank you President Trump !!  We need the Wall.  WALL is CHEAPER !  The additions and upgrades proposed by the Democrats will incur Information Technology infrastructure costs that will eventually exceed the cost of the wall. New digital sensors, cameras, outdoor wireless repeaters, expensive servers to monitor the new equipment, expensive switches to carry the network load. Remote hardware stations needed to allow access to sensors in remote areas.  Digging to extend hard wire networks.  Server updates, sensor and camera firmware updates, switch firmware updates.  The IT costs alone are mind boggling.  THE WALL IS CHEAPER !!!!
Thank you Mr. President.   Pelosi's home district in San Francisco is in disorder.  Homeless people sleep in the street and use it for a toilet.  Men walk around nude trying to attract other men.  Now she is trying to turn the whole country into a wasteland.  We all must let her know that we want a Wall on the border.  Go to her website and get her addresses for her offices and send a letter there so she receives a huge volume of mail to let her know we don't want to be like San Francisco.
Mr Trump:  What you need to do NOW is open the government and bring those workers back to work, they are being used as hostages for your agenda, & that is not fair.  How would you feel if the shutdown affected your family?  But then, it doesn't, they are going on with their lives, not missing a meal or worried about how they are going to pay their mortgages, or rent.  Meanwhile, your wife is flying to Mar Largo on government plane while TSA & ATC personnel are not working or working without pay.  Mr. Trump:  You say you are all for the American people and put Americans first, well, what about those federal employees, are they not Americans?  Think about it, do what is right!!

Don't back down from these fake leaders who are only concerned with their wants and not the people. But please, do not punish our government workers who deserve to be paid. We need another way to get this accomplished. What are we saying to the people who work hard every day? That a wall is more important than they are? I want the wall. I will even vote for all Americans to pay a special tax to fund it. But Pelosi could care less about our people--her unwillingness to talk and negotiate proves this. Lock all of the Dems and Reps into a room and no one comes out until a decision is reached. No baths, no sleep, just negotiate. This is a national emergency--and it needs to be handled as such.
https://canadafreepress.com/article/itin-the-massive-tax-loophole-allowing-illegal-aliens-to-defraud-american-c  Please fix this mess! 4.2 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. As an American we do not get to claim 20 children not living in our home. We as Americans must show proof if we make a mistake we are fined and penalized. This is not fair close the loophole.
Why are we letting Pelosi rule this country? She is not President and yet she is saying no to things the Democrats would like to compromise on and get this country moving again. She needs to resign due to selfish, over bearing, mental problems that we can all see in her. She is overstaying her mental ability to be worth a nickel. I am ashamed of her and I am not a Democrat.

It’s not a crisis.  President Reagan implored Gorbachev to “ tear down this wall.”   No to building communist walls.
Biggest group of illegals are Canadians overstaying their visa. You're not even barking up the right tree
No wall ever
Don’t use the words Americans in your statement because majority are not what you pledged to, only the people with the same behavior and personality you possess claiming to be Americans. All of you are not Patriots and loyalist to our Country.

Let me say this. If I demanded that she speak with me, she does not get to refuse. We are her boss. Not the other way around. We the people tell politicians what to do. The rest of you that stand idle so not count. Ur cowards
If I want to know what Putin's ass tastes like. I'll ask you. Because that's the only thing that you're truly good at.
Go on Mr President with God you will achieve your aim it is for the good of your people God bless you president trump
Democrats have rejected a perfectly reasonable offer by Trump -DACA and TPS protection for 3 years in exchange for a steel barrier slat-fence (wall, whatever). Furthermore, not one damn Democrat politician gives two greasy craps that essential employees (ones made to work throughout the shutdown) are not being paid. We were supposed to validate our time this past Friday. Now, it’s two pay checks  that we will have missed. Retroactive pay is BS; We have bills NOW!    Do me (and other essential employees) a favor and call your Congressional representatives now!  The following bills get us paid now, but are languishing in Appropriations Committees. Refer to the bills below:  Senate Bill 111 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/111?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S+111%22%5D%7D&s=1&r=1  House Bill 371 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/371/text  House Bill 301 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/301?s=1&r=55

Your own speech and behavior influences some people to behave very poorly.  You set a very weak example.

Why would she meet with them? Unlike trump Nancy doesn’t want to use these devastated families to make her point.  trump keeps banging on about promises kept, but he hasn’t.

trump made the system worse - he unilaterally ended DACA & the TPS system.
USA Tax payers have been financing their very own demise. STOP doing that. Start by confiscating George Soros asset and his dark money and deport him, his family, his supporters and beneficiaries if you wish to keep your country.
Great post from Christina Henderson, the colleague of a friend who works in Congress:  A year ago, Trump was offered by Dems $25 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA TWICE! Let me repeat this part — $25 billion for the wall today, in exchange for a 10- to 14-year path to citizenship for 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were young. And twice Trump agreed to it before turning it down 24 hours later (thanks Stephen Miller and John Kelly).  The THIRD time he could’ve had a deal, a group of bipartisan Senators came up with another offer which could win the support of 60 Senators. A path to citizenship for DACA recipients, $25 billion for border security, and it prevented DACA recipients from sponsoring their parents for legal status. Trump was on board in theory to let the “King of the Hill” plan play out (4 immigration bills on the floor and let the best man win), but the morning before the vote, Trump threatened to veto this bipartisan bill. As a result, it failed 54-45. The night before, there were 60. The Trump favored bill, which gutted legal immigration to the US and provided $25 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA, only got 39 votes that same day, to be clear. The lowest number of votes of the 4 immigration bills voted on that day.  Months ago the Senate approps Committee passed a bipartisan $1.6 billion for border security—no new barriers could be constructed. That’s what DHS asked for in the appropriations process. And in the 11th hour, Trump said that wasn’t good enough.  Sooooo this idea that some how Democrats are being unreasonable here is laughable. Every time they think they have a deal he changes his mind on the terms. Staff meets but everyone knows no one but him at the WH is authorized to agree to anything. It is like negotiating with Jell-O. And he has already said he is not willing this time to trade for anything — DACA, TPS, etc. He wants $5 billion, no strings attached. And when your friends ask, why Democrats won’t agree to that after being willing to give him $25 billion a year ago — say these three words: elections have consequences. The makeup of the House and Senate has shifted and so have the votes.  Trump could’ve had his wall, but he’s not a good negotiator—he walked away from the best deal he could’ve had a year ago. Who knows what he’ll say at 3pm today, but at this point it looks like the national emergency is the only way he can save face. Because when he says I’m waiting on Nancy to call me to make a deal, what he really means is I’m waiting on Nancy to come and give me exactly what I want. That may have happened with Paul Ryan, but it’s a new day. And let’s be real, there aren’t even enough moderate, red state Senate Dems left to reach 60 while a third of the caucus seems to be flirting with a run for President.  {fin. leaves soapbox.}”- Christina Henderson

Ann Coulter‏Verified account @AnnCoulter · 16h16 hours ago   100 miles of border wall in exchange for amnestying millions of illegals. So if we grant citizenship to a BILLION foreigners, maybe we can finally get a full border wall.
At this point, is there any difference between a red MAGA hat, Swastika, or white robe with a pointy hood?
You promised a 1900  plus mile Wall!!!! Looks like you caved for a 300 mile fence and putting the dreamers on this side of it!    I hope a true conservative runs against you in 2020, all you have done is compromise and attacked our 2nd amendment and due process rights!😢

Mr. President, this phony Mueller investigation is unlawful. Big Tech censoring conservative voices is unlawful.   We see thousands of conservatives taken off various platforms for "hate speech", the nature and definition of which is continually fluid and indefinable.   I don't understand why you allow all of this unlawful behavior from people who are clearly in the wrong.
We know Sir that you keep your promises. You will get our southern border secure. You do whatever is necessary. We who voted for you stand with you.

Why woud they even want to meet with Pelosi?  It's obvious that she and the rest of the liberals don't give a crap about them or their dead kids.  They simply don't want Trump to get any credit for cleaning up this nation, no matter who it hurts.
Trump said he made a pledge to Angles Families. Was that pledge anything like what he said about the Gold Star Family Khan or the Gold Star Family that Trump said " he knew what he was getting into, when he signed up ".
No more negotiating with these people. Shut the border down completely and we'll see how fast they want to come to the table.
THEN STOP ALLOWING DEMOCRATS TO DELAY THE WALL BEING BUILT... BUILD THE WALL NOW
Trump, I'm telling you I want the government reopened first... Do your freaking job and keep the government open...

Ukraine mulls cooperation with ConverDyn for construction of conversion plant project A private U.S. nuclear energy company could begin helping Ukraine in the production of enriched uranium, the fuel in nuclear power plants, according to a statement on Thursday (July 2) from Kiev's nuclear authority, Yadernoye Toplivo. The meeting, which took place on June 23 in Kiev between ConverDyn external link and Ukrainian officials, is another indication of Kiev's attempts to diversify its future energy needs and distance itself from Russian-produced energy, reports pro-Ukrainian news website UNIAN. "At present, ConverDyn is interested in cooperation with Ukrainian companies in the field of uranium conversion services for Ukraine’s nuclear energy industry," the official statement reads. "During the meeting, the parties discussed the potential possibility of jointly building the uranium hexafluoride production facilities in Ukraine." (International Business Times July 3, 2015)

Where Does Illegal Immigration Mostly Occur? Here's What The Data Tells Us By Sean McMinn & Renee Klahr�January 10, 20194:58 PM ET  When it comes to people in the country without proper documentation, the majority of them didn't cross the Mexican border at all. Most of them came to the United States legally — but then don't leave. About 700,000 travelers to the United States overstayed their visas in fiscal 2017, the most recent year for which the Department of Homeland Security has published figures. DHS estimated that, as of Sept. 30, 2017, the end of that fiscal year, more than 600,000 of those travelers were still in the U.S.

Aloha President, we have found the Simple Solution to the Healthcare Crisis called: Lifestyle Insurance. It’s everything that you have been looking for that conservatives will love – privatizing $5 to $10 trillion worth of lifestyle healthcare now being covered by gov’t programs. Even Democrats will like. I know, I took it DC.  It’s best if offered as a 3 to 5-minute presentation in person (via phone) or u can peruse here on Facebook. Link to the 1 page of the 2 page brochure below.   https://www.facebook.com/LifestyleInsuranceSolution/photos/p.996411033845340/996411033845340/?type=1&theater

Pelvis doesn't car about American family's or the people , she is a treasionest to America and should be put Out Of Office,. She has taken money under the table and sold out the American people ,. 194,000,000 mil.
The democrats Remember that the doctrine of a party is essential to reach the ectica, it is the opening of divine providence to where great men come, among them Donald Trump, an economist converted in the justice of human rights, is the heart that flows . the movement. It is not a theater but a spontaneity where wisdom flows. it is necessary to support our President, where logic is the evidence of the old problem of immigrants who have not found a solution today, I invite you to join the President to help our workers and increase their talent, if they are among them, young Dreamers their gift of being American citizenship.
Give 'em hell, Donnie

MOTHER WHERE OUR THOU
The office of the presidency is broken.
How many times did he say, “MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL.”  He said it in every speech. And when anyone asked him HOW that was going to happen he (not surprisingly) didn’t have an answer.   Not only is he a liar but he is an in your face liar bcz he knows he will get away with it. He will tell you anything and you will believe it.  Now thousands of Americans aren’t getting paid, our country is in shambles, and MEXICO is never going to pay for that wall.  Pathetic.
2 Chronicles 20:20 New International Version (NIV)  20 Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the Lord your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful.”    Praise God. Amen Amen. https://www.missiondelcaribe.org/listing/ghfn/
Don't need a wall that cost 5 billion just so you can profit. You had two years to make borders safe and now all of a sudden
I love my President!! #MAGA
I tend to think of Trump as the antithesis of a politician, Trump is a pragmatic businessman that see blatant waste and lawless ambition of politicians. And absolutely he cares more about United states citizens more than any other president since the founders.

So why have there been over 3,000 immigration staff positions unfilled?  Why haven't you spent the money already allocated for border security?  Why didn't you make this your priority the first two years when you controlled both the House and Senate, instead of spending all the time on multiple failed attempts to destroy the ACA, and passing legislation to enrich the rich and burden all of us with a massive deficit?

..and while tyrants like Pelosi are trying to steal our gun rights by saying if we give you a wall, there will not be a need for guns, just remember the 2nd amendment wasn't intended for defending yourself from others, but for defending yourself from a tyrannical government!!!!!
Pelosi is the sorriest excuse for a human being ever to walk this earth.
GOD BLESS THE ANGEL FAMILIES SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS  I BACK U ALL AND MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS R WITH U ALL ..THANKS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND GOD BLESS U ALSO ..

Please #pray for President Trump. He is under severe attack from our enemies at home and abroad.                                                     Ephesians 6:11-12, 18  (King James)   Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
If his pledge to them is anything like the pledge to the kids in Parkland they shouldn't get their hopes up.
Build that WALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Build that WALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you Mr President
Unbelievable, what’s going on with the DIMMS and RINOS preventing the sovereignty of our nation because of their allegiances to the globalist billionaires and Corporations!  We as a nation are under attack by nefarious forces from the criminal empires to foreign governments.  So, what does this call for in full force is for President Trump to even further his resolve by acting without hesitation in using the Executive Branch to secure our borders, and charge those involved in sedition and treason!

GET YOUR CREWS ON THE GROUND IN RENO, NEVADA...  Press Conference will be at 1PM PST.  CONNIE KOONTZ ... SOPHIA RENKEN ... JERRY DAVIDS ... SHERRI DAVIDS ... These four souls were MURDERED this past week by a SERIAL KILLER who has been arrested in Carson City on an IMMIGRATION CHARGES and is named as the SUSPECT in their murders.  My town of Gardnerville and Reno is in anguish from the loss of these four wonderful, vital people who were purposely preyed on by this creature because they were senior citizens.  I thank God Almighty for our amazing men and women in law enforcement who worked unrelentingly to catch him before he could kill again.  These four beautiful people are dead. Children have lost their parents, brothers and sisters have lost their siblings, grandchildren have lost their beloved grandparents. Their legacies have been cut short.  Our entire community has been held hostage by this event. All of us have spent sleepless nights laying awake listening and afraid. All of us have gone to work unable to shake the mental images of our friends and neighbors last moments on earth. Our bank accounts have been lessened in our attempts to fortify our homes against a random killer. Our children's peace and innocent belief in humanity has been destroyed. This happened because MY country failed at protecting it's most precious resource. It's legal citizens. CHUCK and NANCY.... ARE YOU READING THIS???  YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. BUILD  OUR  WALL

President Donald Trump is trapped. He shut the government to impose his will on the incoming Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. That plan has miserably failed. Instead, Trump has found himself caught in the trap he supposed he had set for his opponents.  Now he is desperately seeking an exit.
In case the real donald j trump forgot....  https://www.facebook.com/1087167058116488/posts/1188671814632678/
Democrats turned the values against the USA.  The drank Obama’s Kool side and they are fundamentally trying to change it to an open border socialist state.  One World Government so who cares where people move.

Stay strong Mr. President

This is a great message bc President Trump comes across to me, as caring, he’s polite and personable. This Angel Mom confirmed what I see. If I was in Pelosi chair, I’d set those ppl right in a hurry. She’s laying low, as they say. If this was Healthcare I’d be on the other side. js... I think we have to look 👀 at this with fresh eyes 👀, open heart’s and mind’s. You have to do a deal, pass legislation, be present. You can’t deny a meeting when it’s your job. A woman who knows her power and uses it in the best interest of the situation, that’s a powerful woman who cannot be bought. Who is Nancy Pelosi ? As a person, I do not know??? She’s hiding.
How much longer are we going to play this game ?  You can end the shutdown and have a wall with a stroke of a pen... What are you waiting for ?
President Trump, please stand firm on your efforts to protect America's borders and keeping us safe. The democrats are wrong in not negotiating with you and they don't really care about the government workers not being paid or they would. It is so very wrong how the left-wing media treat you, so disrespectful to you and the office of the presidency! Praying for you!

Democrats don't give a damn about angel families. Only their potential  illegal immigrant voting base.
Smells like taco meat
(Exodus 20:12). Leviticus 20:10 prescribes capital punishment for adultery between a man and married woman: And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
The liberals should be warned that if they keep poking the tiger, they're going to get bit.

All this as a tribute to childish vanity, Junior Achievement leadership, and Russian strategy:  DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old. Here are 30 ways Americans are feeling the pain:  1. 450,000 public workers are being made to work without pay, including members of the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, Border Patrol, FBI, and Secret Service. 2. 350,000 public workers have been temporarily laid off. 3. Tens of thousands of federal contractors have been laid off for a month, including janitors, security guards, and cafeteria workers. They are losing up to $200 million a day. It is unlikely that they will ever receive pay for the time they have missed. 4. Nearly 10,000 companies that do business with the U.S. government are losing money, according to the Washington Post. 5. Pop-up food banks have opened up to feed unpaid government workers. 6. The four week shutdown is costing the U.S. $200 million a day, or almost $6 billion so far according to analysis by The New York Times. 7. Unpaid TSA workers have been calling in 'sick' or quitting, leading to longer security lines and missed flights. Some airports have begun closing terminals. 8. The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9. Air Traffic Controllers, who were already suffering a 30-year staffing low, have been feeling the strain of going unpaid. Some have begun quitting. 10. With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21. The FTC's identity theft reporting system is shut down. 22. Student loans are being delayed as universities are unable to verify parents' income with the IRS 23. Small Business Administration loans have been delayed. 24. Domestic violence shelters that receive federal funds have been forced to cut services. 25. Highway and transit projects are being delayed or canceled. 26. Wildfire preparations in western states are delayed. 27. The National Hurricane Center's research has been delayed 28. The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo are closed. 29. Funding for Section 8 housing assistance has lapsed, placing low-income families at risk of eviction. 30. Civil cases in federal court have been delayed. Lawsuits against Donald Trump in federal court are on hold.

Please leave this page and read Real News elsewhere about the #MoronPresident For Example: Trump Touts Border Wall In San Antonio, Which Has No Wall And Isn't On The Border  Mary Papenfuss HuffPostJanuary 19, 2019  President Donald Trump on Saturday boasted to reporters about how well San Antonio’s border wall  is working. But the Texas city is 150 miles from the Mexican border and has no wall.  “Everybody knows that walls work. You look at different places, they put up a wall, no problem,” Trump said outside the White House. “You look at San Antonio, you look at so many different places, they go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities, immediately, immediately.”  The president may have intended to refer to El Paso, a Texas border city he referenced last week in an almost identical anecdote ― though he is wrong that the wall there had any effect on its crime rate.  Trump discussed the nonexistent wall in San Antonio before he offered three years’ protection for the so-called Dreamers — immigrants who came to the U.S. as children — in exchange for Democratic support for $5.7 billion for his border wall. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) quickly ripped the deal as a “non-starter.”  Part of San Antonio is in the district represented by Texas GOP Rep. Will Hurd, who opposes Trump’s wall as expensive, ineffective and damaging to private property and the environment. His district includes 820 miles of the border. In an interview this week with Rolling Stone, he called Trump’s characterization of a “crisis” at the border a “myth.”  (You can read the rest at news.yahoo.com and read actual news anywhere but on this preposterous page, led by an accomplice in the tRump Crime Family.)
Thank you Mr President 2020!!
Stop talking about it and do it!
I support Mr.Trump Xoxoxoxo 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

UNITED BIKERS FOR TRUMP
Things has to be done decently and in order. This was tacky, careless, cold hearted and heartlessly. Starting with tearing families apart leaving kids to defend for themselves. Granted, things has to be done for the border. Y at the cost to get what u want thru negative reinforcement? Bulling. Negative behavior NVR draws a positive response. U know this Trump! U understand the power of words and for u to go against what u said is the most humiliating thing for u to do. Ppl are suffering Trump. Heck, u are suffering. Do u not have health issues? Throw in the white towel already...
Stay strong.

I don’t want the wall.
If you voted for Trump because he promised you a wall, blame him. Last January he had full funding secured and reneged. Last June he had an immigration bill and completely botched it, flip flopping on issues and being uninformed. 2 years of total Republican control and they managed to force an unpopular tax bill and add $2 trillion to the debt.  Trump could have delivered the wall, even if Mexico paying was a lie, and he did not deliver either by choice or incompetence.  House Democrats were elected in part to oppose the wall. 60% of the public opposes it. They are doing right by their voters.  They never promised a wall.   If you're upset there's no wall Trump promised you and he failed you.

There ahould not be one Angel family
I have heard many Democrats say "Oh Trump is a billionaire Tycoon trying to use the government to get rich"--> Sorry but Trump is not the owner of a steel factory or oil company or drug company-- this is not how I understand Trump made his mark --> instead he made his mark in the toughest real estate market in the world: NY.  Now if you ask me, Trump is trying to help the economy FOR REAL because wealthy Americans PAY THEIR RENT ON TIME! this is a win-win.  This is super easy to see.. and by the way, IF YOU DONT LIKE LIVING THERE: MOVE!
Now some people think "Robots" can replace workers.. and they might be right.. so they may think depopulation would be ok since robots can build the products.. PROBLEM: ROBOTS WONT BUY YOUR PRODUCTS!!!!  this is flat out destruction of civilization.
the law of supply and demand.  wages are a price.  scarcity of workers affects the demand (price) / (WAGE)!!!!  this hurts minorities the most.  a lot of people are aware of this.  not only that but every year public sector gives itself raises but private sector is held down by mass immigration.  This is a problem even for Democrats because ultimately, even if you tax the private sector 100% you will not be able to fund the public sector.  As it is, there is talk of removing private property and every other scheme we conquered at the dawn of America and the forces driving these motives are caused by mass migration which drives down wages via the LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND!!!!  we are screwed if we don't fix this and it really is national security.  MEANWHILE the people causing this are doing every thing they can to stop citizens from having children..
even if you have a masters degree and your parents had no degree, you can not afford the same quality of life as your parents (on average)-> this is the honest to god truth.
the horror stories of crimes by non-citizens are scary but the scariest of all is the monetary effect of driving down wages and driving up the cost of living.. Fact: even if your parents did not go to college and you did, you can NOT afford the same quality of life as your parents today.  THIS IS WHY
We want the Wall
Nancy doesn't care !

Clueless fool needs to find a way to resign.  But he can't plea-bargain until the charges against him are made public.  So he hangs around, watching Fox News and eating hamburgers, at the center of a closed government and a public that overwhelming disapproves of him and everything he stands for.
Nancy doesn't listen to us.
Thank you🇺🇸
Im sorry for your loss
"Trump has long defined himself as a counter-puncher: When he’s hit, he feels the need to respond in kind, out of a fear that failing to do so will be a sign of weakness. But in this case his return volley underscored his own impotence. Knowing exactly how to hit him where it hurts, Pelosi has threatened to deprive him of his biggest audience of the year if he persists with his shutdown; in terms of optics and political capital, canceling a Congressional delegation (referred to in official Washington as a CODEL) is small potatoes, and the fact that the legislators were going to see American troops in a war zone that he has not yet bestirred himself to visit only makes him look more petulant." https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-petty-shutdown-games-show-art-deal-author-has-ncna960276?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma

Real News: When #BigotPresident meets #MoronPresident: San Antonio does not have a border wall and is 157 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.  President Trump incorrectly claims San Antonio has a border wall  Speaking to reporters Saturday, the president cited San Antonio's nonexistent border wall as the source of improved security in the city. TEXAS Author: Kens5.com staff Published: 2:30 PM CST January 19, 2019 Updated: 2:48 PM CST January 19, 2019 WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — Ahead of his "special announcement" Saturday on the government shutdown and the border, President Trump told reporters that "walls work," citing San Antonio's security improvement since putting up a wall.  "You look at different places," Trump told members of the media, "they put up a wall, no problem. You look at San Antonio, you look at so many different places. They go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities immediately. Immediately. It works, we have to put them up, and we will put them up. We've got to."  San Antonio, however, does not have a border wall and is 157 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.  Trump visited the Rio Grande Valley along the edge of the U.S.-Mexico border last week. During his visit, the president took part in a roundtable discussion on border security and met with Border Patrol agents stationed along the border.  Throughout the government shutdown, which has lasted nearly a month, Trump has insisted that a crisis exists at the border which would be fixed by a border wall.  During the president's visit, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told him the state will build a wall along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border if the federal government pays Texas back.

THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT... for the first time in many years we have a leader who is not controlled by special interest and Wealthy lobbyist... I pray that your supporters become more aware that our sovereign nation is a Constitutional Republic governed by We the People... and that there are probably hundreds of our own elected representatives who don't want us to know what that means and don't want us to support your effort to restore to us that awareness. Unless we are very vocal, and not just here on social media, but in contacting our congressmen and representatives making our voices heard.... the more he speaks to the people the more he brings like to his reality of the darkness in our three branches of government.

Watched Nancy's remarks last night on our local news station TV10. Still unwilling to work with the President in any manner!!!  Words out of her own mouth last night on national TV  was ( I DON'T WANT THE WALL,. I DON'T WANT THE WALL,. I DON'T WANT THE WALL,. ) So there you have it. Nancy don't want the wall. The shutdown will stand . Thank you to Nancy and Chuck and other DEMOCRATS ! For hating President Trump so deep you willing to hurt the American people!!!
You know what i hate? Every time there is a poll or letter from anyone in government it ends with a donation.  Why is that?  Also the GOP always want money in Trumps name and many of them don’t or haven’t in the past been a supporter.  Just looking at our own problems.  I am sure liberals do the same, but we need to be better.

FOX News Update. President Trump reported in an exclusive interview that he has made a deal with Dear Leader Kim on the border wall. In exchange for removing all troops from Korea, Kim agreed to send 10,000 North Korean dissident workers and three boatloads of steel slats to build the  Wall. Government opens back up on Tuesday.

Real News: On Saturday night, Breitbart panned Mr. Trump’s latest idea with the headline “Three-Year Amnesty, Most of Border Remains Open.”  In Trump’s Immigration Announcement, a Compromise Snubbed All Around  President Trump offered on Saturday to trade temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for border wall funding.  By Julie Hirschfeld Davis Jan. 19, 2019 WASHINGTON — Immigrant advocates denounced it as cruel. The conservative right howled that it was amnesty.  What President Trump billed on Saturday as a compromise to end the country’s longest government shutdown pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs to strike a deal nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall.  Instead, in offering temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for funding for a wall, Mr. Trump did something rarely seen during his presidency. He tried to reach beyond his base of supporters — which polls have begun to show is losing patience with him as the partial shutdown drags into its fifth week — and speak to a broader swath of Americans.  The Saturday afternoon speech from the West Wing was an attempt by Mr. Trump to, at the very least, shift the narrative of the past several weeks and show that rather than spoiling for a longer shutdown fight or making unreasonable demands, he was looking for a broadly acceptable way out of a morass he once boasted he was proud to wade into.  “I think you could tell by the president’s remarks today,” Vice President Mike Pence said, “that we’re reaching out.”  Yet in seeking to inch toward the center, Mr. Trump alienated portions of his hard-right base, the core supporters he most depends on and the group he and his closest aides have most feared losing. That raised the possibility that, in his zeal to get out of an intractable situation, he may have landed himself in the worst of all worlds, without a clear solution or the support of his most ardent followers.  The tensions and anger over the policy have been quietly playing out in the West Wing as well, as Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, fended off Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda. Mr. Kushner has long been a proponent of protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, while Mr. Miller has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration.  In recent days, as White House officials had been working out the details of the compromise, Mr. Miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity.  While the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that protected those illegally brought to the United States as children, Mr. Trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700,000 who are enrolled.  Mr. Kushner conceded in a briefing after the president’s speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the DACA program, which Mr. Trump moved to rescind in 2017.  “At this moment in time,” Mr. Kushner said, “this is a good path forward.”  Many conservatives did not share that view.  “Trump proposes amnesty,” the conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Twitter. “We voted for Trump and got Jeb!” she added, referring to Jeb Bush, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status.  Still, in the eyes of many White House officials, the prospect that Mr. Trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure Democrats to end the impasse was worth trying. Mr. Pence argued on Saturday that the speech was a “sincere effort” by Mr. Trump to break the logjam, and he and other White House officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist Democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with Republicans.  But such a coalition did not appear to be forming, and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention, eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak-kneed capitulation.  The vast majority of Democrats knocked the approach. While many of them have pressed for measures to protect DACA recipients and immigrants living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe, most regard the proposal he put forth on Saturday as woefully inadequate. It offers only three years of protections for the DACA recipients and those who hold T.P.S., which the Trump administration has also moved to end for several countries.  “This is not an amnesty bill,” Mr. Pence said. “There is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal.”  That was high on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s list of reasons to call the plan “unacceptable.”  That is unlikely to matter to the president. Despite saying publicly last month that he would be proud to own a shutdown over the wall, and privately displaying confidence that his base would stick with him through the fight, Mr. Trump has been dismayed to find otherwise in recent days.  An NPR poll released last week showed Mr. Trump’s approval ratings down and the first cracks in backing among critical supporters, including whites without a college education and white evangelicals.  Such pressure from what he has called the forgotten men and women who elected him and chant “Build! The! Wall!” at his arena rallies has swayed Mr. Trump before, including last year, when the conservative news site Breitbart branded him “Amnesty Don” for considering a similar deal that would have provided $25 billion in wall funding for a path to legal status for those the DACA program was created to help. The president ultimately abandoned that agreement, concerned about angering his base and after Mr. Miller and others advised him he should insist on additional immigration restrictions.

Easy fix!  Start with military maneuvers and training on the southern border practicing for an invasion. Next sale all military bases in prime locations and move them to the southern border. That will put billions of dollars into building the wall and border security.  Because there’s no reason why  military bases or on prime American real estate

Brent Robinson keep up the great work. Your posts have been spot on and lay out the right positions we need. As for the false data offered from the Washington Post, that paper might as well say Communism on Display with Fat Liars across the front page. That paper is not worthy of the litter box.

The Washington Post is the most left wing nut job paper in the country and the supposed data they have conjured up is not based in fact. Sorry for those who point to the Post as a source. Please grasp the truth of this. Any crime by an illegal is way way to many. To make it worse is the idea you would defend the idea that illegals have some right to murder American and get a pass from the rest of us. You are some kind of nut job all by yourself.
Carol Wolfgram Yeah -- approval rating 🙄 . How was his approval rating when he won 306 -227 in 2016  ?-- no chance as I remember 😎 . ( oh .. and don't start with the 'popular vote' bs --  we go by the Constitution in this country ).
Brent Robinson He should have started in 2017 when the republicans were the majority he wouldn’t be playing the blame game,

Brent Robinson , Do you feel the same way about gun control so that there aren't  ANY  MORE mass shootings but because it done by WHITE AMERICANS LET THEM KEEP HAPPENING,
Brent Robinson  They don’t care how many people die? Where are you getting your information from Brent?  They?  Who are they? They can’t allow to keep fulfilling his campaign promises?  What are you talking about?  trump has had two years time and the support of both houses and he couldn’t get his promised wall built. Neither has he collected the funds he promised he would from Mexico.  The state of trump’s approval is all down to himself and no one else.  Those who oppose trump are not traitors Brent, they simply think he is not fit for office.
Brent Robinson Mueller will solve the problem once the Orange Orangutang is arrested and thrown in jail.
Brent Robinson  Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S.

#رسالة استغاثة من اهالي البصرة الى رئيس الولايات المتحدة الامريكية ترامب...الترجمة في الاسفل... A message of distress from the people of Basra province to the President of the United States of America. Trump respectable.  We are the people of Basra province. We ask you to rescue our province of Basra from the Militias  Gangs who have been stealing the oil of Basrah since 2003 and to this day, they are sending it to Iran and to the terrorist organizations that fund them with weapons. We have been carrying out large demonstrations against these gangs, but they respond to us with repression, torture, murder and assassination. We lack the simplest means of living, such as water and electricity. We demand reforms and appointments for the unemployed youth, many of them graduates and holders of higher diplomas, but the armed groups monopolize appointments for themselves and their parties and gangs. They are killing all those who speak a word and stand against them and they take the presidential palaces in the province of Basra, a place known to the Iraqis, and in the recent demonstrations have fired live bullets at the demonstrators and killed many innocent young people who claim their right, and the assassination of civilian activists In front of their homes and in the streets and markets, We are asking your presence to intervene quickly to rescue us from these dirty armed gangs. We know that the US military has entered Iraq and we welcome this very welcome because we believe that the US military has the ability to rescue Basra, Iraq and Iraqis from these gangs. We hope you will receive this message and respond. Because you are the only hope now for all Iraqis. Thank you Mr. Trump. Youth of Basrah Governorate...........  مترجم الى العربية. رسالة استغاثة من اهالي محافظة البصرة الى رئيس الولايات المتحدة الامريكية ترامب المحترم. نحن ابناء محافظة البصرة نطالبك بأنقاذ محافظتنا البصرة من العصابات المسلحة الذين يسرقون نفط البصرة منذ سنة 2003 والى يومنا هذا ويريسلونه الى ايران والى الجهات الارهابية التي تمولهم بالاسلحة. لقد قمنا بالتظاهرات الكبيرة ضد هذه العصابات ولكن كان القمع والتعذيب والقتل والاغتيالات هو الرد علينا, نحن تفتقد الى ابسط وسائل العيش مثل الماء والكهرباء, نحن نطالب بالاصلاح والتعيينات للشباب العاطل عن العمل وكثير منهم الخريجين واصحاب الشهادات العليا ولكن المجاميع المسلحة يحتكرون التعيينات لصالحهم ولصالح احزابهم وعصاباتهم, انهم يقومون بقتل كل من يتفوه بكلمة ويقف ضدهم وانهم يتخذون من القصور الرئاسية الموجودة في محافظة البصرة مقراً لهم وهو مكان معروف لدى العراقيين, وفي التظاهرات الاخيرة قاموا بأطلاق الرصاص الحي على المتظاهرين وقتلوا الكثير من الشباب العزل الابرياء الذين يطالبون بحقهم, وقاموا بأغتيال الناشطين المدنيين امام بيوتهم وفي الشوارع والاسواق, فنرجوا من حضرتك يا ايها الرئيس التدخل السريع لانقاذنا من هذه العصابات المسلحة القذرة, نحن لدينا علم بان الجيش الامريكي قد دخل الى العراق ونحن نرحب بذلك كل الترحيب لاننا نعتقد بأن الجيش الامريكي له القدرة على انقاذ البصرة والعراق والعراقيين من هذه العصابات الفاسدة, نأمل ان تصلك هذه الرسالة وتستجيب لنا لانك انت الامل الوحيد الان لكل العراقيين. شكراً سيادة الرئيس. شباب محافظة البصرة.  من بريد الصفحة كما وردت

For Discussion: Will the Traitor-In-Chief finally destroy the Repugnant Party from Within?  Read, then Discuss: From WAPO - ‘This is your fault’: GOP senators clash over shutdown in private luncheon Republican senators clashed with one another and confronted Vice President Pence inside a private luncheon on Thursday, as anger hit a boiling point over the longest government shutdown in history.  “This is your fault,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) at one point, according to two Republicans who attended the lunch and witnessed the exchange.  “Are you suggesting I’m enjoying this?” McConnell snapped back, according to the people who attended the lunch.  Johnson spokesman Ben Voelkel confirmed the confrontation. He said Johnson was expressing frustration with the day’s proceedings — votes on dueling plans to reopen the government, both of which failed to advance.  The people who attended the lunch spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a closed-door session. Aides to McConnell, citing regular policy on GOP lunches, declined to comment on the gathering.  The argument was one of several heated moments in a lunch that came just before the Senate voted on the opposing plans to end the shutdown offered by President Trump and Democrats.  The outbursts highlighted the toll the shutdown has taken on Republican lawmakers, who are dealing with growing concerns from constituents and blame from Democrats, all while facing pressure from conservatives to stand with Trump in his demand for money to build a wall on the border with Mexico.  The votes the Senate cast on Thursday were the first on the shutdown since it began Dec. 22, with McConnell and other GOP lawmakers previously refusing to vote on anything this year unless it had Trump’s approval — a policy that has drawn widespread criticism.  The day ended with some limited signs of progress. After the votes, McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) engaged in a face-to-face negotiation that senators hoped would lead to a solution in the near future.  The first proposal, which Trump put forward, would have allocated $5.7 billion for wall funding in exchange for temporary protections for some immigrants. Only one Democrat voted for it. Two Republicans rejected the plan.  Note for Bonus Points Discussion: More Repugnant Congresspersons voted for the Democratic Plan than the one advanced by Emperor Fullofshiticus.  Fact.

Nancy is a nut job lady is always against the president.
When you take care of your own Russian oligarch FRIENDS and ignore the desperate plight of 800,000 workers and their families ...  Document shows Trump, GOP sanctions lift a boon to Deripaska: NYT/Ken Vogel “Contrary to the insistence of the Trump administration, lifting sanctions on oligarch Oleg Deripaska's companies benefits him tremendously.”  Once again, Russia trumps the USA in the mind and heart of a traitor.
By and large, border towns do NOT want this stupid, expensive and USELESS wall.   They say it daily (read below) and most Texans have agreed to file a class action lawsuit against Emperor Fullofshiticus if he ever tries eminent domain. Following is an excerpt from today’s news:   ‘It’s Not a Wall,’ but Steel Slats and Barbed Wire Roil a Border Town  By Jose A. Del Real Jan. 23, 2019 CALEXICO, Calif. — The barbed wire overhead evokes danger and violence, but Maritza Hurtado cannot take it seriously. When the sharp coils were placed on top of the old border fence several months ago, running right along the main boulevard, she chalked it up to political propaganda from a White House that does not understand life along the Southwest frontier.  “This is not a war zone,” Ms. Hurtado said from her tax and immigration consulting office in downtown Calexico, from which she can peer into Mexico. “I’ve had a business here for 30 years and we’ve never needed the barbed wire. Why now? To me, it feels as if I’m enclosed.”  For nearly a year, President Trump has pointed with pride to a renovation project replacing two miles of border fencing in Calexico. He hailed it as “the start of our Southern Border WALL!” — to the great consternation of many of the town’s residents, who are wary of becoming the public face of a hard-line immigration policy that most here do not agree with. The attention the president’s tweet brought was surreal, in part because the construction replaced an unsightly stretch of steel fencing that was already there.  Nationally, partisans and journalists began to debate whether the 30-foot-tall steel slats that make up the replacement barrier should be called a “wall” like the one Mr. Trump promised during his campaign. Others said it was just a “fence,” a distinction that has taken on great importance in Washington.  Lost amid the battle over credit and semantics was how Calexico residents themselves felt about becoming characters in Trump-era political theater. For many, a sense of apprehension turned to anger when the military installed barbed wire on top of older border fencing, which runs through downtown.  “This community is basically being used for political purposes,” said Ms. Hurtado, who served as the town’s mayor until December. “And it’s happening throughout these border cities that are just like ours.” She tried to remain diplomatic when television news crews asked her for comment about the barrier last spring, she said, to “avoid making more drama for this community that has nothing to do with the national problem.”

President Trump should keep the government closed for as long as possible so he can focus the media’s attention on the question of border security. Once the government reopens, for sure it will do nothing other than mouthing ‘impeachment’. It should stay closed.
Our President is a brilliant political strategist. He just pushed the Democrats into a corner and there’s no way out for them that doesn’t end up w/ egg on their face and a big beautiful wall up on the border.
Thank you for doing your Job ! Now if the Dem run Congress would do their job which is not blocking “anything Trump” ! Those on shutdown would be wise to remember this is now on the House controlled Dems !
Did you ever think why Democrats don’t want to build the wall, it’s not because they want to bring illegal immigration and help them , their personal agenda is to bring illegal immigration to get and keep the power in the White House they don’t really work for the American people they work for their own personal agenda.  if you want to see a difference don’t forget to support Donald J Trump on election time 2020

I'm sorry you still believe in a man proven to be immoral (not just adultery but scamming workers from their pay and much more), rude, disrespectful to our men and women in service and veterans; a man with the demeanor of an angry spoiled child who happily watches people having to go to food banks, some even putting their homes up for sale, because this man, this one you still believe in, will not accept what has ALREADY been offered in a bipartisan offering to add to the billion he hasn't spent yet on border security. This is a TEMPER TANTRUM! Do you have children? Would you let all the other children suffer because of the actions of one? And yet you believe in him still. That brings into question either your own morality or your intelligence, not something I can know. But you do. and also? He's just not a smart person. Period. https://www.mediaite.com/tv/trump-says-border-wall-has-worked-in-san-antonio-a-city-100-miles-north-of-the-border-that-has-no-wall/?fbclid=IwAR2voiI0QTACXj-u-XyOjbZmcobdPnAyzG6odsyL45YmI1nZ53kORt-Kg-0
Ok Congress you are supposed to do your job. You are risking the lively hood of Americans.  Dear President Trump I think the wrong people are having no checks. I know if you could hold the money that the senators and reps are getting instead of federal gov people, that are suffering now with no pay. Do you thing they would end this faster?     The wall is the right thing to do. You are my President and I still believe in you and our Vice President.    I think I will get a twitter acct so I can send this too you.

preach!!! Waaay to many hand outs... Plus you can't seriously tell me if someone having the job as a governmental employee you're not going to put a decent amount into savings knowing there has been shutdowns with every single presidency.. Or decent planning with said savings.. No way in hell is it paycheck to paycheck.. And if it is that fault is on you and your spending not the government taking your hand outs and ebt... But what to do I know? I'm a trumpeteer 💁
Sad that the Swamp is still alive and well...
Somebody in democrats dictated Nancy Pelosi of what she suppose to do as speaker of the house.Work together to our leader for the better of our nation.
If you want to make America great  resign the presidency. #TrumpIsAMoron
All we can do is trust you. Nancy needs to be drugged and put to sleep like the ritual for old useless animals.

My Client Resigned From the White House. It's Time for Trump to Think About His Children and Do the Same  Impeachment should be far from the President's only concern By Martin London (VP Spiro T Agnew’s attorney, back in the day)  The BuzzFeed report that former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has told investigators that, after the election, President Trump instructed him to lie to Congress has raised new calls for impeachment. But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen’s testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions “internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents”) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family — specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. — knew the details of Cohen’s secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as “deep involvement” in the discussions with Russia — a subject they’ve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had “extensive discussions” with the family members. The outlet’s two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them “very detailed updates.” If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump’s firm support in the Senate — which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House — dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President’s immediate concern is Mueller. This is not like Trump firing of then–FBI Director James Comey, which lawyers can challenge because it was technically within the President’s constitutional power to do so for any reason, good or bad. This is conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony. There can be no argument that the President has the Constitutional authority to conspire to, say, cause somebody to rob a bank — or commit any other felony, such as giving perjurious testimony concerning the President’s conduct.  Don’t forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex–campaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President’s power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer — and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?  At some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment. The longer the President waits, the more evidence piles up, and the tougher it will be to get a deal. Mueller already has a federal grand jury hearing evidence that just received a six-month extension. The President should make his deal before that body completes its work. The Mueller report may accompany a clutch of Mueller indictments.

Democrats don't care about American lives, as long as they get their illegals to vote for them! That's what it's all about! Trump will get our wall funding, and we will remember what the democrats have done during this shut down! Partying in Hawaii and Puerto Rico while people suffer and Americans are being murdered!

Before you build the wall, can you finish the I-5 Interstate here in Los Angeles first? A measly 10 mile expansion is being worked on for about 10 years.

I say give pamphlets of towns and address of all those opposed to the wall to those coming over without proper papers. and they can put up tents and campers for them in there front and backyards. I think that would be a nice jester. While I put a wall around my place guarded by pit bulls german shepherds 30-06 and a Glock 9.

Real News: Since this was printed a new poll shows his support even lower today ...  SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT IS HIGHER THAN HIS APPROVAL RATING, NEW POLL SHOWS  BY TIM MARCIN  Will Donald Trump Be Impeached?  President Donald Trump isn't exactly popular right now. In fact, a new poll shows that more people seem to support impeaching him than approve of the job he's doing.   The survey from Public Policy Polling—a Democratic polling company that also does public polls—pegged Trump's approval rating at just 40 percent, while 57 percent disapproved. Forty-six percent of voters, meanwhile, supported impeaching Trump, while just 44 percent are opposed, according to the poll.  The survey polled 760 registered voters from January 19 through 21. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.  The survey also pitted Trump against hypothetical Democratic opponents for the 2020 election to see where things stood. Trump trailed all seven likely Democratic candidates that the company used: former Vice President Joe Biden (53 percent to 41 percent), Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (51 percent to 41 percent), California Senator Kamala Harris (48 percent to 41 percent), former Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke (47 percent to 41 percent), Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (48 percent to 42 percent), New Jersey Senator Cory Booker (47 percent to 42 percent) and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (47 percent to 42 percent).  "It really doesn’t matter which Democratic hopeful you test against him right now," said Dean Debnam, president of Public Policy Polling, in a statement. "Voters prefer any of them over Trump at halftime of his Presidency." - Newsweek

Sending a letter to Nancy is a bad idea. I do not want my name address & email spread all over the internet and I do not choose to receive unsolicited email from political organizations or causes. Declare a national emergency and build the wall without congress. You are the boss so make an executive decision and get the job done Mr. President.
I feel sorry for your child being brought up by such a troubled person. Inbreeding I'm guessing.
Susan J Soler WHAT?
Pelosi is being exposed for the obstructionist hateful person she is... Her hate for president Trump overrides any real concern she has if any... Wish we could stop paying these people
Build it! Tired of screwing around. Just build it!
I am confused, we are to accept that people die when they serve our country, that is the price we pay, right, accept it. But when it come to the wall, which is for our protection, we are suppose to feel sorry for someone who misses a paycheck, or waits a little long for anything.

Real News Traitor Working For Russia Destroys America From Within  'There's no money': Shutdown freezes HUD funds for low-income senior citizens  “If something major broke, I wouldn’t have the funds to replace it," said a manager of an affordable housing building for seniors in Florida.  Jan. 11, 2019, By Suzy Khimm and Laura Strickler  The government shutdown means that the long-leaking roof of San Jose Manor II Apartments won’t be replaced anytime soon, says Alma Ballard, who oversees the building for low-income senior citizens in Jacksonville, Florida.  “That’s definitely not going to happen,” said Ballard, executive director of the nonprofit Family Housing Management, who said that water has at times dripped into some residents’ rooms.  Ballard said Family Housing Management had been saving up for a new roof for the 50-unit government-subsidized property, but had to put the plans on hold because its contract with the Department of Housing and Urban Development was still in the process of being renewed when the shutdown began. The company never received its December and January payments from HUD, totaling about $40,000, immediately putting the property under financial strain.  Shutdown threatens housing funds for low-income senior citizens The few federal employees left at HUD have been scouring the books, looking for a last-minute solution to fund hundreds of affordable housing contracts that have expired under the shutdown.  More than 200 of the contracts that expired in December are for properties, like San Jose Manor II, that provide rental assistance for the elderly, according to LeadingAge, an association for nonprofit providers of aging services. Known as Section 202, the program houses about 400,000 low-income elderly people as part of HUD's Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance as well as a separate HUD program.

Stay with it Mr. President. We support you sir. The swamp is being exposed! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the obvious, the people who do not want to support border security are not working for the tax paying law abiding American citizens but instead working for illegals who choose to go around our laws and sneak into our country.

Patrick Sciarratta, there you go! You took a single polling entity and compared it to another single polling entity to create your skewed statistic. But if one wanted to be more ethical, they would have simply compared the average of all polling over one time period to another and saw the results. For you, it was never about being truthful, just to pervert polling to your advantage
Bob Segal Ah, I see. Re-read my post. I never mention an average. I see your mistake. I wrote ‘a poll’ not ‘an average.’  I believe that POLL was at 42% in December.

Patrick Sciarratta, it NEVER was 42-49% as an average. The highest average Trump had was 43.3% and today it’s 41.4%, or a drop of about 2% from the high, which is still within any real margin of error.  There is NO 7 point drop! Even on this one, economist has a high of 45 and even if you took his all time high of 49 would make this one a 4 point difference, not 7
Bob Segal  and Cora: Bob is showing us that the poll I referred to was 1POINT OFF - and the one below it, which I should have quoted, would have been accurate.  A ‘stone cold lie’ or the wrong line which put me one point off, using Bob’s proof?  Please.   Cora, snowflake, don’t defend the popular vote when speaking about the Electoral College President. Actually, the poll that said she would win the popular vote was correct, wasn’t it, by 3MILLION?!   Why do you guys get so uppity on issues where you are only marginally correct or incorrect?  You must loves you some pussy grabbin demigod, eh?

If you intend to compromise about DACA, to extend their privilege to stay here, Homeland security should charge $1,000.00 each for the application.And also $1,000.00  for TPS.

Build the wall, change the immigration laws and let us get back to a government that can listen to the people who elect them not the lobbyists.
I’m guessing none of you are government employees not getting paid
We need an open fire policy at the border.
too late for our Zionist's occupied government! enemies already in.
Nancy needs to be put to sleep old dog
No amnesty, no anchor babies, deportation of illegals (start with the JAILS); no CHAIN, no job visas that replace American workers, JUST NO BULL to get cheap labor !
Thank you President Trump for fighting for the victims of illegal immigration and supporting their families. Illegal immigration hurts all of American society.
If anyone tells you that walls do not work, they are liars!
Its good no think he Indian view this these Indians are real black eyeonthese all setelite

Why a wall?If a bigger problem seems 2 be underground?
angels are the best!! Go Trump What the hell is wrong with Demacraps I don't understand!
I have lost any respect that I have had for you!  It is not about you politicians---it is about securing my country.  I resent you snd have zero respect for your self-serving party.
Poor Jr. High "mean girl" Nancy and her coharts, Diane, Maxine and others have the Dem. men so bullied that they cannot think for themselves.  Otherwise, the men would step up and do the right thing.  They all have voted  yes for these issues so many times before. What a waste of good minds.
Please Mr. President do not cave or give illegals any status or benefits. Do not betray our trust!
Do not back down on the wall.
Hello Sunday!  Take the time today and reflect back on the Ten Commandments and the Commandments not being followed by those who pressed their hand on the bible when sworn in to office.  Nancy read and reflect the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th.  Then I,m sure you will have No Problem meeting with the Angel Moms and the President.  In keeping with the 3rd. Call upon The Lord to give your soul guidance not your Party today.  Praying for Everyone today that this effects!  Praying for our Nation today!
Made a pledge to defend 2nd Ammendment too!

How much did you pay those media to not bash you ?

HAPPY 2ND ANNIVERSARY PRESIDENT TRUMP #2TERMTRUMP
Ok today i decided to check the age of this dem senator by name Kirsten Gillibrand coz she always calls her self a young mom..I mean she is 52 and that aint young ok..Stop using the term young to lure millennials in voting for u..
Thank you President Trump, You are the Man for this job! In GOD we trust!
I <3 My President ! Thank you for fighting for the AMERICAN people! #BUILDTHEWALL
Instead of a wall, why not build sniper towers every mile. Anyone that comes within 100M of the border gets sniped. How many do you think you will have to kill before they get the message? I’m sure be lots people,that would man the towers.
Donald J. Trump, why would you be willing to make a deal to put 800,000+ useless government employees back on the payroll?  These folks and what they do are pointless.  If you really want to make significant changes start with eliminating all of these folks from government and end the income tax/stealing.
"There are some things in our nation and in our world to which I’m proud to be maladjusted… I never intend to adjust myself to segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few, and leave millions of people perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of prosperity.  I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, and to the self-defeating effects of physical violence…  And I call upon you to be maladjusted to these things until the good society is realized…" --- Martin Luther King Jr.
So sad that trump supporters are filled with hatred and fear of others. They support a man who lies and is morally bankrupt. Sad.
Patricia why? Nobody ever wanted to do that with Bill Clinton.

Dear America and World: I have read before and I think it is still going on: Russia has been infusing the United States and other Countries with false information, propaganda and Lies through the internet and other media outlets for the past 6 years at least. They have had goals for over 20 years now to shape the geopolitical world into their image and lately, it seems Donald Trump has been obeying mass-murderer Putin's orders!

Why don't you make a pledge to all families affected by gun violence?
NO WALL!!  There is NO crisis at the border!!!  CIty officials of border towns deny there is a crisis  This is ALL made up by YOU! Just MORE lies so you can pander to your base of UN-educated cult followers
End Trump Shutdown immediately
Nancy and Chucky let Trump get the Border Wall built and now 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
ONLY SOCIALISTS BUILD WALLS.
Mr President do you need congressional permission to “repair” the fence ? Can you use emergency funds to “REPAIR” the fence and fill in the gaps ?
How many people have to tell you that your “one size fits all” vanity project won’t work? We need people and technology to monitor the border, not a wall.
You promised MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR THE WALL. NOT AMERICANS.
WELL LETS GET MOVIN - THEY KEEP SAYIN NO NO NO NO NO  SOO LETS START 🥁 #BUILDINGTHEWALL ♥️

What, you're status as an angel depends on the race of your murderer?
If the House and Senate worked as hard as The President, think of all the important things hat could get done.
Stop the democrat shutdown now. Build the wall!
You made a promise to provide your taxes and what about that affordable healthcare for everyone - you probably never kept a promise your entire life
READ MY LIPS: I will take the blame for shutting the government down. Mexico will pay for the wall. I won't blame you Chuck for closing the government.
Yeah you're really fixing it all right
Mr president, declare the emergency and build the wall. It won’t be political suicide. It will only strengthen your position and make the democrats think twice about not playing nice!!!
These precious Angel Families have been through so much heartbreaking grief.  For Nancy Pelosi to refuse to meet with them is reprehensible.  AMERICAN Outrage against insubordinate Nancy Pelosi is justified everyday.

OPEN OUR GOVERNMENT or nothing can be accomplished!       BLACKMAIL is unacceptable!
Our president is amazing. All that oppose him are running scared. We will prevail. We will get border security and hopefulley deport millions in the process.
Build that Wall President Trump! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
PRESIDENT TRUMP: What would happen if you met with AMLO and figured out a way to Make Mexico Magnificent, giving them incentive to stay in their own country and giving immigrants from other countries an alternative to the US. I had no idea Mexico was so desperate until I read this!!! IN-FRICKIN-SANE!!!  C&P from an article, reporting the recent catastrophe,  I read this morning:  "The tragedy comes as Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador -- known as "AMLO," who took office in December -- has vowed to eradicate fuel thieves who illegally drilled taps into pipelines an estimated 12,581 times during the first 10 months of 2018, an average of about 42 violations per day.
There ain’t gonna be no damn trump wall, so get over it!
Great president in recent history we support you and we stand with you Donald Trump 🙏💪💪💪
Use me as a dislike for democrats.  TRUMP2020
When all fails lie,lie,lie ....Democrats memo .
Apparently you made a stronger pledge to Putin to destroy our country.  #AgentOrange #RussianAsset
Excellent points from Marianne. So sorry for your loss and many other losses due to the criminals that are coming over the Border. The Democrats have destroyed our freedom and our safety because of their selfishness and their lust for money. President Trump is fighting very hard to make things better and safer for us and expose the Democrats for who they really are.... Heartless Liars who just want their power and their money back. Our United States is not their personal piggy bank. We must be strong and safe and United the way we used to be. Many thanks to President Donald Trump! ❤

You all can not do a damn thing about it but twiddle your thumbs as long as politician and Democrats need Shady votes they will keep getting away with it the reason President Donald Trump can't do a damn thing about it, it's because the house has control over what people can say and do and what they can vote for not the people and not the presidentthe legalization of recreational marijuana could be used could pay for the wall

OMG, how insanely ridiculous is it that a US president would create his own media network to spread his foul propaganda? Worse, how incredibly gullible and stupid do you have to be to fall for this crap? Good thing less than a third of the population is this ignorant. Still, that's too many.
Make our borders safe, build a wall and more border patrol

All true and loyal Americans that love our country want the wall! This is the highest priority for the safety of all Americans. The fight has not been about a wall as we all know, it all about attempting to derail any progress President Trump is making. The speaker of the house is not a person that is capable of perfecting any of us and will always be an obstructionist to secure this country!
dont give in to them Mr president. We are behind you

Yes because people in their 50s/60s remember a country without these problems. After Israel built their wall, terrorism decreased by 99%, so walls work, even the least intelligent among us know that

Republicans controlled  the House, Senate, & President for the last two years. Why didn’t they pass a Wall bill? NOW it’s a CRISIS! Give me a break.
Did anyone else notice that the current government shutdown started under a Republican controlled government?   The current shutdown started Dec 22 (under the old congress) and the new congress started Jan 3.  Wtf on so many levels; but wtf?
A friend once told me that we are all immigrants. Yes but we came through the door at Ellis Island and were documented. We came on by the rules.
Why do Democrats support and defend illegal immigration, even declaring "sanctuary cities and States", and also resist voter ID?  How does supporting illegal immigration and fraudulent voting benefit the average US citizen? Any citizen?  How could anyone vote for any Democrat and think themselves a patriot?

Our elected officials first and foremost priority should be the American People and the USA..  I do not vote party.  I am an independent.  WE NEED TERM LIMITS.
Gary why would a wall hurt. Something needs to change so why not a wall. I can’t imagine you are ok with the drugs and child trafficking. The wall is not the only solution but a start.

I do not know what Nancy Pelosi really cares about but I'm certain it is NOT women and children, and it is not life, or she would not be such a proponent of abortion.  And though she claims to be Catholic, her daughter's anti-Christian films prove to me this family has no faith in God.

Nancy get off your broom and build the wall.
Silly Billy gumdrops. Closing the government until you get funded? More like holding your breath until you turn blue..ya whining baby.pfft

Mr President if Mexico is handing them over to our borders..no foreign aide??!!!! Why give them money they are part of a problem that we can’t be having..give them some when they fortify thier border and stop letting them in give them a little more..if they don’t then we don’t!! Simple quiz pro quo solution

Oh gawd. Not her her again.  Just goes to show you that Trump will starve american people to get his way.  My heart goes out to her but this happens everyday by white people who drink drive and cause deaths.
I _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic... The responsibility of government is to protect IT’S citizens - not protect illegals. It is an immoral outrage to steal from the American taxpayer in order to give to those who come here illegally and by force.

Raymond Mitchell But people are suffering and losing their homes and can't pay their medical bills. And building a wall won't stop people from getting killed. People get killed every day by other Americans. And the law is wrong. God wants mankind to live and work together not claim land like that. The land should belong to all mankind. And we shouldn't have to suffer just to claim land.
Stephanie Kay Shockley you are not losing your home in 30 days.get real
Stephanie Kay Shockley He is doing what's right! He wants to keep America safe,if your kids or any loved ones were one of the many people that were killed,raped,and beaten by an illegal immigrant ,you would want the wall as well...
Stephanie Kay Shockley how many illegals do you want to support. Send them a check  maybe they will stay home.
You need to stop trying to fund so much money to have that wall built. I know it's important but not so important that we the people have to suffer for it. People are working without pay and can't pay their bills and as a result are losing their homes all because you are arguing over a stupid wall. People's lives are more important than a wall. And not being with your family on Christmas because of that isn't right either. Why can't we just all get along? Find a way for the US and Mexico to live together in peace. God created the land for all mankind to live together, not so we could fight over it. I know the opinions of one person don't matter much but I just thought I'd get out how I feel about this. Please stop fighting and think about what's best for the people for once and do what's right.
Build the wall. its the only way to go God bless you and your family.
Open the government!!! Then do your job !!!
Pelosi is too scared to face the truth,,,Wimp
I don't remember Trump pledging to starve Americans but then, as usual, he lied!
Thank you, Mr. President! Build the wall!!!
Mr President why not put down half a billion dollars for  your wall ? You have the money and you very well know America can't afford it.
This is one of those areas that has been left out for a long time. We have had the border conversation so long, Pelosi and the the others don’t take it seriously. I was raised in Texas and when I was 14, I walked into the girls room at school, and there were 3 Hispanic males rapping a friend at knife point. Nothing is going to change as long as someone on this side is making money. You want the wall, you get those people out of the way.
Nancy Pelosi please give Americans the wall and it's necessary anyways. Just do it.
Janey Renteria you need to review the law. Commander in Chief means exactly that. He is responsible for protecting this country, not the House or the Senate. Children are wrongly being used by the migrants to gain entry into this country. Our laws are outdated, and this requires action to secure our borders.

A wall is not necessay or desired.... Station our Military on all American Borders and give the order to lock n load. What part of illegal entry is not understood? Remember 9/11 and never ever forget the lives lost. The lives lost in the War on Terrorism also!

Dear Tump, he needs to announce it, because we need their votes for 2020 do not forget, if you do not say it, we will lose 20 million votes in 2020 we all agree algal cannot come to the U.S. but some algal been here last 20 years and they have children.
I can understand the need for the shutdown for such an important issue of the wall. . What I do not understand is WHY are we still paying our representatives  in Congress and the Senate, when they are not doing their job by fixing this. Maybe if they felt the heat that we the people are feeling, they would have a different outlook of what a majority of Americans deal with.  We elect and pay for our representatives whom are not doing their JOB!  They need to be FIRED. Please help if achieve this.
I think Nancy Pelosi would be much happier if she stop using her head as a suppository!

Simply cannot understand why she thinks shes in charge
I am with you 1000percent  Mr President. YOU CAN COUNT ON ME .RECON.
Thank God for President who is trying hard to keep us safe while Nancy Pelosi, et al, are putting us all at risk.
Damn this political stunt and the idiot followers who actually fall for this.
Angela Merkel makes Europe great again. EUROPE First
If that's the case it has to be a borders to be fair, if not it's prejudice.
Every Angel mom wishes their child was worried about paying their bills during this shutdown
Dear President Trump, Nancy is not in charge you are, she is show-boating like she owns it, SHE doesn't YOU do, We the people of elected you
Thank you very much Mr. President!

You not need to change the wall for DACA stop that.  The   wall is for save the PEOPLE  from  USA  thanks Mr. President trump.
How about if we give in to the Left and say that all the immigrants can come to America but they have to live in California or a designated sanctuary city and they will receive no federal money.  They will have to be supported by the state and city where they live.   Let the left deal with the chaos afterward, then they can't blame the President, because it's what the big babies are crying for.  Just a thought from a person who is tired of all the fighting.
I’m do not understand,will TPS have the permit to work after September this year?
We already have a we the people petition and have raised over 20 million and it’s going strong.

Build the Wall . While waiting for that can you make college tuition deductible - Middle class pays for full college tuition - and out if the 40,000 a year we can deduct 4,000. Its Breaking the middle class down. Help.
Pelosi is on her way out.. just a matter of time..
It will not do any good to tell Nancy any thing because she does not care what the American people want.  More than likely she has illegals working her vineyards.
your country is broken my friend and I don t think you can fix it
I don’t understand why this is taking so long .... most home owners in America have some type of fence around their property for added protection for keeping outsiders out and family in ( animals, kids , etc. )  .... this is basically a bigger fence 🙄
Yes Texas needs the wall . Stop all the Drugs following  into  our country also all the crime . WE NEED A WALL NANCY .

Mr. President, our whole church prayed for you and your family this morning.  Thank you for what you are doing for our very ungrateful nation.  You have many supporters here in Plant City and Lakeland, Florida.  We love you and uplift you in our prayers.  Keep fighting the good fight.
Father of bricks and founder of Wall.
Dems are the ones holding the government hostage. Build that wall and keep us safe.

That woman is everything but right 🙏🏻
I know you will do every thing you said you would do for America and her people. God bless you Mr. President
In Germany we scold' it HEUTE SHOW
Okay. First let me say that I voted for Trump and I support the  idea of building a border wall but, the story I just heard doesn't support the reason or need for a secure border. Drunk drivers have nothing to do with it.  Had that driver come to the United States legally, the driver probably would have been drunk regardless.   I apologize for any bed grammar, spelling, or punctuation.
It doesn't matter how it gets done, build the wall!!!! One America life taken by an illegal person is too much for this country to bear. Yet we have hundreds. Stop the madness and protect American citizens.

Nancy should not even be in a position to make decisions like this. Also we should vote all of these people who is holding this up just because they don't like our president out of office....🤨🧐
Why can’t trump just fire Nancy problem solved
We want the wall  open the government
Build the Wall - thank you President Trump 🇺🇸
If we stop giving illegals food stamps, healthcare....etc, then we will have the money to BUILD THAT WALL 🇺🇸
GOD BLESS THE FAMILY OF OFFICER MENDOZA AND ALL ANGEL FAMILIES. GOD BLESS ALL POLICE ,AMEN
Build  the wall/fence two feet tall and go home all is well now.
Close this Loop HOLE and use this $ for your damn wall!  https://www.facebook.com/cory.wood.505/videos/2448828438465023/
If government employees want to go back to work, they need to contact their state Democrat  representatives and hold them accountable for being more concerned with politics then the wellbeing of their constituents.  Majority of Americans want the Wall. We need the Wall!

Even the Vatican has walls.
We are with you all of the way!!!
No Wall ! Not under your terms ! Stand strong Nancy !
Don't Give up Mr President ...I'm behind you 110%
Let America vote on the Wall... would sure save a lot of time, money and stop the financial heartache on our federal employees.  Let us make the decision.
We need the wall done.this wall is to protect American people.You can't sleep well if your home's doors are open.
Odd argument dems have about "drugs not coming on people's backs." They do come inside balloons in drug mule's stomach's. But on a larger scale they come on off road vehicles, going around check points, through the desert. It is a lot harder to do that if a 30 foot wall extends miles into the open sand. If you force them through check points with cameras and dogs or make them take long detours they are easier to catch.
I have been watching videos on OSCAR EL BLUE and Anthony facebook pages.   It makes me worry for our country.
Awesome interview my prayers are on going for the families that have lost their love ones bless you all and we stand  up for our President to build the wall

On another note 📝. How about that global warming Al Gore, it’s colder than House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lack taters.....
I like your dad, But you Lara! You should not talk!!!!!!
We Love you!!!!!  God Bless You President Trump!!!!!!
We Love you!!!!!  God Bless You President Trump!!!!!!
Hold Strong 💪 to that commitment!
She wouldn't want a first-hand account of the damage her policies have caused
Build the Frigging Wall! Iraq Vet.
Only REAL MEN admit when they're wrong. You've been played. But that's ok, we all have. The difference here is admitting when you're wrong, learning from it & moving on, right?        Be a man.
Might be easier to work with Mexico’s government to build the wall. 🤷🏻‍♂️
That is messed up. He should of never been here
WOW! How come you know all this?
One impeachment caserole coming up.
the socalist/ communist democraps.... are gonna have to build a wall dont worry.... IT IS TO KEEP US IN.....
Trouble is she is not listening.
I am so tired of hearing what  Nancy Pelosi has to say. You can be sure I am not on her side.
Build the wall. Retire Nancy you have no clue you just like the attention.
Build the wall. Retire Nancy you have no clue you just like the attention.
You also made a promise that we would not have to pay for it!!!
Do not waiver in your position Mr. President. Stand Firm.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
While you use slave labor (unpaid federal employees) to corrupt our government?! No wonder you get along so well with Dictators... takes one to know one?  Birds of a feather and all? Boo for you.
Dean A. Groetzinger humpty dumpty trump is the "greatest negotiator". That was a lie too, right?
But you also said Mexico would pay for the wall not the US citizens and not spuriously through savings from the replacement for NAFTA.
They are not going to give him the Wall , he'll have to build it without them !!!
I’m proud that you are my president what a great promise you made to these people and to us your base now stand strong against Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and the rest of the demo Kratz don’t give in change the system right now and this with a victory for the good guys just for Once
Thank you President Trump!
Thank you President Trump!
I love what Mr. Trump is doing !! But the shutdown is taking the wrong people paycheck. If you take the one’s who is trying to stop it paychecks they will agree to it by the end of the week!!!!

A wall will NOT fix our immigration system.
Can we set up a go fund me page for all those federal employees who are not getting a pay check?
Why don’t you think of something that will actually work, like technology.  You can go over and under a wall and you know it.  The people you claim to want to keep out don’t even come into this country that way.
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby, Of course mama's gonna help build the wall.
Fine I signed it as is, but all that sappy polite crap made me want to throw up. Nancy just needs to have her ass kicked and not be rewarded with kind words.
You are WAISTING your time with Nancy because she just DOES NOT GIVE A DAM about AMERICANS. She is an AGO MANIAC and has no interest in we 2nd class people called AMERICANS.
BUILD THE WALL!  That’s what the American people voted for when they elected Donald Trump, OUR PRESIDENT!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Four decades of old IMMIGRATION laws bad for 2019 update.
We dont need a wall never had one.
Why don’t you just take the money you need for your “230 miles” of wall from all of the corrupt congressmen, senators, lobbyist, pharmaceutical companies and monopolized businesses???? I bet you could fund your wall REALLY FAST if you did that!! And I bet you’d gain some brownie points along the way with the average Americans who are suffering from this unnecessary shut down. Just saying.... 🤷🏻‍♀️ It’s time to “put your money where your mouth is”

What is it going to take to make an executive order close up our borders. What is taking so long to do such thing
Please declare a national emergency and get the “barrier” built. I don’t really think most of us care what it’s called. Don’t let the democrats stop this from going forward.
So many members of this administration devote so much time and energy to figuring out ways to try to explain blatant lies as remotely resembling something in the neighborhood of a mere miscommunication. How on Earth do people fall for this schlock? To put it bluntly, they might not be thinking hard enough. The technical term for this is "reduced engagement of open-minded and analytical thinking." It’s okay for you to believe what you believe. It is not okay however, for you to insist that everyone else believe the same as you. This border crisis is made up, check the facts. There is a border crisis, but it’s not the southern border, it’s the northern border FACT! We don’t believe you, we get the facts via factcheck.org. STOP LYING TO AMERICA!‬
All I will say is how about all democratic in the senate or congress not getting paid. They really don’t know what it’s like not to get paid or live paycheck to paycheck every week whether you have kids or not. Some of us only make 25000 if we are lucky not 100000-400000 thousand a year. Negotiations need to happen, people need to pay their bills. Do we need more people unemployed. No...
The immigration system is not broken. Enforce the laws as written.
Keep organizing the country to take it back never give up. Organizing is what Americans do best collectively under pressure..
Doing a great job!! Stand strong for the American people!!
Doing a great job!! Stand strong for the American people!!

She doesn’t care. Just there to collect a pay check.😡😡
God Bless you President Trump he is on your side and so are we! Thank You for keeping this country a great place to live.
Build the wall strong and tall.
Well your presidency is narrowing so better hurry up !!!!!!
President Trump, I thank you for honoring your core values and commitment in putting America first and protecting all off us.  BUILD THE WALL.. Stay firm to your determination and address our country at the State of the Union knowing the Armor of the Lord  gives you strength, as you speak the truth.  Americans are firmly behind you. We love you and your leadership.

Draftdodger daddy payed off doctor known fact
If you want your stupid wall so bad, pay for it with your own wealth. Stop trying to steal America's money and bankrupt our economy like you do your business.
Stand tall,firm,no backing down, assured that you are supported, and knowing that in the history of this problem, you are our only hope to end this fiasco! Unbelievable how this country has changed for the worse!
Someone else wrote this, enjoy:  Have you ever wondered why someone would spend millions ( mostly of other people money) to get elected to a job that pays $174,000 year? Because of the FOIA, all this information is out there if you care to research it. For instance, in the last two years alone, Congress and the Senate have spent $4.66 Billion in airfare for themselves. Our money. $2 million a year for parking, our money. Now keep in mind, every member of Congress on top of their annual salary of $174,000, receive $1.5 million in an expense account, while senators each received $4.2 million each year. This is for offices, staff, etc etc..And unless the expense exceeds $25,000, it doesn’t need to be accounted for. After two terms, they receive 70% of their annual salary as a lifetime pension. Plus social security, plus a house pension plan. And then in 1998, they gave themselves an additional pension plan called the Thrift Savings Plan. They said it was needed to match the private sector 401k plans, but theirs is much sweeter. Here’s how it works... each congressman gives 1% of their annual salary to the plan. For this, the government, ie you and me, add 5% of their total salary to the pot, for a total of $10,440 per year in a private pension. That’s a pretty good deal, $1740 and you get $10,440 guaranteed. Lords and Ladies, Kings and Queens. They rule over the peasants. When the country was founded, congressional pay was $6, per week. And remember, it was never meant to be a full-time job. Congress was only to meet two months a year to do the people’s business and then return to their homes and jobs. Republic? They can’t even spell Republic. It’s an oligarchy with lords and lady’s who keep the peasants in check by passing more and more laws and restrictions. And if you go against the empire, you will be crushed and everything you love destroyed. So work, pay your taxes, obey the laws, vote in the make-believe elections, and be a good peasant. Because until a present-day George Washington comes along, that’s what we are, tax-paying peasantry who are ruled

#Trumpshutdown day 30 (Longest in US history). Stop your temper tantrum and end it. It's all on you, as you said yourself. Federal workers and their families are hurting and this is not about national security.
You had Republican control for 2 years. Why didn't they give you the money for your wall????? This is all on you. Not the Democrats!!!! I was hoping the major announcement was you were resigning!
She is a card carrying Communist..  wants nothing more than to destroy America
Build the wall put American citizens first.  MAGA.  President Donald Trump is my President.
God bless you and your strength
As thousands of AMERICANS struggle due to the shutdown. Way to go, Mr. President! You’ve sure left your mark now.  I sympathize in the Angel families and believe we need to secure our borders. But what about those that are about to be evicted because they already live paycheck to paycheck?   Despicable!
Of course it would. Electronics to track the microlight and agents to intercept where it lands. Why would that not solve the problem,?

Andy Jenkinson, then if drug barons will use micro lights to fly over the border, then your solution to add more agents wouldn’t solve the problem either, would it?
Joanne Buck Yea, And lazers and sharks and sharks with lazers!  No, it does not.
As it is not sea to shiny sea people will go around it, drug barons will use microlights to fly over it. $500 per inch is still ridiculous. Better to use the money at the crossing points for detection and personnel. Is he planning on replacing the existing barriers which are lower than 30ft and have no detection equipment? Where can we see the exact specification for the wall?

30 ft high and  American Steel with Sensors..and deep foundation to stop tunneling.
5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
I'm glad we have a President that is actually doing something for the American people. Build the wall that's what most of us want! Don't think Congress should get paid while the government is shut down. After all they don't do their jobs.
Hold the Line Mr. President! FOR American citizens and Legal Immigrants wanting to become American Citizens!
Hold the Line Mr. President! FOR American citizens and Legal Immigrants wanting to become American Citizens!
Stay strong!  There are more people supporting you/backing you than the media & the dems are saying.
Can we put Nancy on the other side after you build it?
President Trump, please build the wall. Protect and keep America safe. God bless you and your family. 🙏🏻 🇺🇸
Fake Russian president !
While some federal employeed  Americans are losing everything at the same time. Brilliant Einstein!!!
I did? When he said he wanted to run for president!
glad you could admit it was broken before he took office
Oh… we have a broken System alright...  Youre still president
NO WALL! REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT!
NO WALL! REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT!
Thank you Mr. President.  Stay the course and keep exposing the corruption
Thank you Mr. President.  Stay the course and keep exposing the corruption
Just a Suggestion:  End the government shutdown by following this procedure and timeline:  1.  Give the President and Congress 5 days to come to an agreement.     a.  If agreement is reached, open up the government.     b.  If no agreement is reached:         1.   The government will immediately re-open based on 2018 spending levels.         2.    The 4 leaders of Congress (2 Republicans + 2 Democrats) will appoint 2 joint committees.                 The committees may include members of all parties or may be partisan.                 a.  The first committee will be appointed by the two Democratic leaders to establish legislation                          on DACA (up to including a path to citizenship).                         1.  The committee will consist of 3 Representatives and 2 Senators.                 b.  The second committee will be appointed by the two Republican leaders to establish legislation                         on border security (to include up to $5.7 billion on a wall/fence).                         1.    The committee wil consist of 3 Representatives and 2 Senators.             3.  Both Committees will have 5 days to establish legislation.         4.  Congress and the President will approve both pieces of legislation as they are written by the              respective committees without further discussion, within 2 days of the legislation being presented.  Advantages of this procedure: 1.  Takes egos out of the process within 5 days. 2.  Maximum of 12 more days of shutdown. 3.  Resolves 2 contentious issues 4.  Eveyone gets what they want. 5.  No one is completely happy. 6.  We can all get on with our lives.
Stay strong Mr. President!   Give nothing to those Democrats!!
There are many good words to say about Pelosi.  I just can't think of any right now.
Behind you all the way, please don't give up the fight!
Is there a law that if the speaker of the house is so adamant and ditrustive, about making any law work in Congress with the President that you can override her, excuse me but she isn’t the President! And Thank God for that! Her arrogance is getting to everyone,
Stay firm.  Build a strong border.
Mike Hill WHAT?
U bend on wall u loose votes mine included
Yes...You did it...sir ! and Congratulations TO U... Today is January /20 day of your Presidential inauguration like 45th president of USA  ...
A proposal being rejected even before it was announced! What does that tell us about the Dems? Come forward and make the deal. Our President has a proposal on the table. We Americans need to get back to our normal life. We need to end the shutdown. We need to be a country with secure border.
Please re open our government
So everyones gonna act like obama didnt build a wall, huh?
stay firm for additional barrier/fence  everything else is negotiable
How about we also fix our foster system as children are sill being put into abusive homes
great offer to democrats  dont listen to hardliners  negotiate on bill to open government  2020
Ask a Psychic to contact John McCain and ask why he voted against it.
How about that promise to fix out broken healthcare system?
It is time Nancy's emotional and mental stability is challenged to continue on as Speaker of the House.  She is gone at this point....and hurting this country and herself.&u%ting this country
Get her built!!  The wall that is!
Thank you President Trump for keeping your word and fighting to secure the wall on our southern border. Praying for you that it's a win-win and the wall goes up.
Nancy don't want it so she isn't about to do what the people want.
Keep working on Nancy to change her mind on the wall.  Thank you 😞
President Trump ask God for Wisdom like King Solomon did ask in Jesus name.
God bless you and all Angle families.
So the country can crash and burn but we really need a wall how stupid do  that sound
Mr. President, don’t give in, build that wall. We the people are depending on you.
Thank you Mr. President for staying strong. We are behind you and pray for you every day! We want a secure border. We want a wall.
It is time to TAKE ACTION Mr. President.  Take to Twitter later.
THE BEST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITEDF STATES OF AMERICA! GOD BLESS HIM! 2020!
THE BEST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITEDF STATES OF AMERICA! GOD BLESS HIM! 2020!
My heart goes out to all the family and friends of these angel mom's,  this atrocity should never have occurred in this country,  when is our government going to care about the American citizens like they care about illegal aliens?
Trump's election promise was for a concrete wall from sea to sea. He is now saying 200 miles of steel fence. Is THAT keeping his promise?
Stop paying the members of congress, and no back pay neither
Yes he does Nancy is stalling fact!
Please resign!  You continually embarrass our country   we want logic in place at the border not a wall!
Nancy Pelosi hides from the Angel Moms and afraid to even listen to them.... Pelosi is ignoring people she is supposed to represent.... Pelosi is not a leader... just a taxpayer funded propaganda machine for anti-American forces!!!!

Build that wall. Take your indifferencies & dislikes away, & let the President do his job Nancy!!
The Dems are not going to give this Pres. a win, especially the Wall. They would rather see the country destroyed than to do that. And the Dems have the nerve to call the Pres. a traitor? Bunch of hateful hypocrites.  That's all they are. Everything they're accusing the Pres as being is exactly what the Dems are. Best Pres. the US will ever have. MAGA 2020!

Bunch of hateful hypocrites.  That's all they are. Everything they're accusing the Pres as being is exactly what the Dems are. Best Pres. the US will ever have. MAGA 2020!
No pay for Congress!!!!  Of course, Nancy doesn't need it. She's worth over one hundred million. So what does she care?  I'll bet her mansion is surrounded by a wall (with armed guards)

Thank you trump build the wall. Build the wall. Illegal come
Nancy.....the people want the wall funded , now
Look at everyone selling America for their paychecks! Dear Americans and friends, I believe, I believe, Donald Trump is just an ignorant flunky for wealthy special interests in government and in health  care and  that they are bankrupting our future for their wealth. He is deceiving us with the republican Congress and protecting special interests in health care and special interests in general. They are paying lawmakers for their support and complicity. He is not helping in his terrible immigration with his super rude noise; he is hiding and protecting wealthy and selfish interests at the expense of everyone else. The swamp has given Donald Trump directions not to bother them in their money making activities and he is obedient to them and going after defenseless poor people, refugees that need mercy and a humane chance as a ruse to deceive we the people. 	We are being badly governed in his cruel immigration hoax while he is being patted on the back for deceiving the middle class and helping the wealthy lobbies. As proof I offer humble Canada and that they are not as corrupt and arrogant as our non humble elected officials.  	What is the answer but to vote these carpetbagger republicans out of office and never to support Captain Ahab again!
Keep going. Agree with the wall
President Trump thanks for all you do and trying to fix our borders, you are the only President who has took a stand on this, and my family thanks you, you have integrity and you also know what we need, build the wall, we have to, save our sweet country, God Bless You..
I don’t think she cares what we want.
This President has our backs he stands up for us Americans which other presidents didnt have the balls to
Trump 👏👏👏🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾God bless you 2020👏👏👏🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Um, just open the Government and continue to negotiate.  Duh.
Funny thing is, the wall isn’t an immigration reform... it’s just a wall, an expensive useless wall
Don't give up, we are praying for you and helping the unemployed in the government in Mobile, Alabama.
What happened to Mexico will pay ?????🤦‍♀️🤪🤷‍♀️🙆‍♀️👎🏻
I sent it one on behalf of my husband and one on my behalf.  Check it out!
Nancy and her ilk need to swing by the neck.

We're standing firm with you, Mr. President.  We're unwavering like you Mr. President.
FAKE MEDIA TAKING  BRIBES FROM DEMOCRATS TOO ? CNN  THE MAINSTREAM  ?
President Trump go before Congress and tell them you will give up on the border wall if every Senator and Congressman tears down their wall or fence protecting their homes! Give them two choices. They either agree to the wall to protect our borders or they tear down their wall that protects their homes!
The reason we elected President Trump was to fix this messed up country. The wall has got to be built.

This isn't Trump's wall!!!!   It's the USA's wall!!  It's MY wall!!  It's everyone that voted for Trump  wall.  Make it happen
Democrats can't stand someone who keeps their promise ! They lie to get elected, and promise is just politicians way to office....
#MAGA I LOVE MY PRESIDENT ❣️
Pelosi, don't want the border wall, yet she has a wall around her house and a very high fence.
Anyone who has a fenced yard or lives in a building with security who opposes the wall is a hypocrite. Simple  as that!

Open border field..open US citizens pockets that will pay somehow.
Pray for the Angel families that Nancy P would not even walk out of her office to see she is a disgrace to America and the democrat party
Thanks Lara, we need New Congress.
By the way anyway they're trying to find a way in the office to impeach him so who's going to be the next president after that happens because I know y'all don't have my vote
Build the wall Nancy, we need it!
On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
By all means fight, but what your doing isn’t working try fighting the problem from within. Make the people want to stay where they are.
Nancy's last  name  is  spelled  POS.........

Don't back down!!! WE Stand with you Mr. President. Until the wall is built Do what no other has done. Activate the Militia and We will guard the border and safe guard this great Nation untill it is built. No money has to be spent. IF You ask I Know my self included Many would come forward and Volunteer for guard Detail. My Self like many vets took a Oath to Protect and Defend the Constitution of the United States against All Enemy foreign and domestic Sir. And we have never been re leaved of that Oath. WE stand ready to Serve again!! God Bless you Sir
How long is this wall and where will it be? The VP says 234 miles. Is this true? Maybe if the president were more specific and consistent, the congress would commit our money. The founding fathers were so wise to plan a system of checks and balances, especially now that we have a petulant president with a history of bankruptcies and lawsuits.
I love the fact the white house now has their own news channel just like CNN or fox ..except this one has real news non of that poison cnn dishes out
Nancy & Chuck r warped don’t conform to their madness
Nancy & Chuck r warped don’t conform to their madness
Lara, I would like to thank you for reporting the "Truth News", a lot of times the truth is hard to hear however it must be heard.  It is in plain view, many things at the border have been neglected for quite some time, of course, the solutions won't come quickly, taking the first step by closing the door will stop the bleeding, so to speak with that being done, there will be a clear picture of what is broken in the system and that can be addressed  properly one problem at a time. How can we solve these major problems while living in the unresolved major issues day after day.? Some say no wall, others say yes a wall, well let me say this... if I sit at my window and look out to the road and there I see a man lying on the shoulder of the road, blood pouring from his head, what will I do?  Close the blind or pick up the phone, make the call then go tell him help is on the way. So yes I chose, I made the call, then quickly ran to him only to find it was my own brother laying there. wouldn't I be rejoicing that I did something.?  We the American people must understand that doing nothing or believing that those who have been in office all this time are telling us they are going to do this, that, or the other thing ( which they never got around to doing)  at least the President is acting on it.  Hopefully, we can all see clearly that it is time to act.  So I leave you with my thoughts and feelings wishing you all well, God Bless.!
Hey trump, angry democrats counter offer,  NO WALL,
If I'm behind our President on any of his undertakings because I definitely don't agree with all of them, I'm behind him on this one 1000%+
What’s so funny is that this country was stolen from the native Americans lol but we keeping everyone else out
really the crisis gets worse.🙁
really the crisis gets worse.🙁
Janey Renteria I am saying if you don’t love this country and want to protect it against illegal invaders, then yes, you are not a patriot. Sorry if the truth hurts your little feelings 😩😆🤣
Lena Sorrells Resnick So are you saying because I may or may Not believe in everything exactly like you, I'm not a True American? Wow what has this country come too? So 😢
We true Americans are behind you 1000%, Mr. President!
Corrupt Nancy pelosi showing her true colors.of course she can't face the victims of her evil policies.
What's up with the 3 year extension on DACA & TSA? Not happy about that. Not sure compromising on something that is wrong in order to get something that is right is the way to go. Stop pandering to the Dems and stick to what is right Donald J. Trump and we real Americans will stick with you!
Mr. President, please stand firm and build the wall. Now. We need to be secure. (I live in Texas.)
Don’t let them talk you into opening the government and then we will talk please don’t fall for this trap they did it once don’t let it happen again build the wall
Pelosi needs to retire! Either she is too stupid or dementia is setting in.
#Trumppower Making America Great!
Thank you!! Keep up the fight for the wall!
What a bunch of crock. Fix something that is actually broken like Russia’s influences in the WH and all the lies that comes out of there. Break those ties!

We need the wall because Mexico president is letting everybody in he has open border
Great idea!....now, how about listening to the experts as to how you do that(?)
So you sacrifice government workers in order to get this stupid wall.
Absolutely agree this Democratic are horrible
Thank You  Mr, President for all you do. Shame on Pelosi and Schumer.  They sure don't act like Americans.

Good morning Mr President,  just saying we love you and your family and are praying for you
A pledge from you is worth exactly jack 💩

Nancy are you working for illegals not for us US citizens due we want the walls
STOP!!!! Work together be adults!!!!  Nancy if you can’t work with the president we have then step down!!!!!
You are NOT serving all Americans!
So many things I want to tell Nancy and her inbred son Chuck
What about all those 1000’s of people dying daily from drug overdoses ?
Start a go fund me page for the Wall
Might have to admit not manufactured crisis
Thank you President Trump...
Declare State of Emergency, Build that wall.

Since only US Citizens have the right to vote in the USA WHY should non-citizens be counted when determining the number of representatives from any area!
Just a thought how about putting the hurting where it belongs.  Of the 800,000 not getting a paycheck during the Government shutdown.  How about the only ones who suffer are the ones making the votes.  It's not the American people sitting in those stubborn rooms of negotiations.
62,000,000 American’s voted for Trump, if we all send a check for 10$ would that cover the building of the wall?

Yes I stand with President Trump always
Stay strong, mr. President.  There’s  a lot of people behind you.  But, please, no more amnesty offers.  Please!
Omarosa is a smart cookie. She taught us all a lot. She protected herself well by recording everything that he had to talk about. So now we are finding a lot more about him in this new day and it is not good. So I take my hat off to you Omarosa for a job well done.
Is that what smoke trump is blowing up his supporters asses now?
With all the amounts I’ve seen of her spending tax dollars on alcohol, I would say she’s a full blown alcoholic and needs to go! She can’t even speak!

And to quote Donald trump himself “it doesn’t matter what we build the wall out of or how good it is if they wanna get in they’re gonna get in”
America does not need to be anything like them
Israel and Russia are basically fascist dictatorships with zero morals and who rule with propaganda torture and corruption
Americans need to secure its borders like Israel and Russia.
No one wants a damn wall we aren’t Berlin Germany
Dont give in to those assholes ever keep standing your ground
I do not favor a wall because I don’t think it will be effective. I favor hiring more border patrol agents or stationing troops on the border to turn people away even though it is probably more expensive.
I fully support the president and his wall, but it's not enough. The wall needs to go into the ground, about 25feet, have seismic sensors to know if anyone is tunneling under it, and be wide enough to patrol on top of it. (Drops mic)
The Democrat party are now the servents of LUCIFER!
Awesome President thank God.
Why can’t the compromise be hiring more border patrol or stationing troops instead of building a wall?  I would support that.
I SIGNED the petition.  But honestly, she does NOT care!

Ella Lafer-de-waal what on God's green earth has this Russian spy done for America? Oh right! A Yuuuge tax cut for his billionaire buddies and CEO friends..have you seen the deficit since he took office? You know 200 indictments ago...The U.S. Treasury reported that October’s deficit was $100 billion, an increase of $37 billion or 58% from a year ago. While one month may not be a trend, it puts the full-year deficit on a path from $779 billion in fiscal 2018 to $1 trillion in fiscal 2019. He's a business genius? lol suckers!
Well done to the president, definitely right...
Secure our borders!! I wonder what color the wall will be.
Wall, wall, wall, now, now, now now please dont ask again
TASS reports: Some 84,000 take to streets in France during Yellow Vests protests (yesterday). Where are the mainstream media reports?

I could shout it from the rooftops and still my Governor, my Congressman and my Representative would not hear me. I'm just an American tired of my rights being trampled on.

Never surrender to the Left...they will through a stick in your bike spokes every chance they get...gather the American worker/taxpayer and explain that border security will render value for every American...end the illegal immigrant disarming of fair health care and National Security! Now!
I want the wall ! One reason I voted for him! Our country is being taken over and soon it won't be the country we were privileged to grow up in! Look what has happened to it in the last few years ! They are breaking the law people ! Obama 's 8 years in office nearly destroyed us!

Trump caused this shut down and no one else he even said so.
Mr. President, I'm an ordinary citizen residing in Houston, TX. I'm proud to have a President like you, true to your words all for the good of everyone. You have Done ENOUGH . I believe it's time you leave the job to the implementors. Stop insisting but because this provision has been approved long, long ago congress and senate should be serious that Wall issue had to be done ASAP. Let GO and MOVE on.make sure that our government employees get back to work , lift the government shutdown. We want you to keep the presidency . God bless.
Wow! Thank you for sharing! Love and pray for our President Trump and family and also now praying for you angel Moms! Blessings strength and wisdom for all!!!!😘🙏🏻❤️
You couldn't negotiate your way out of a paper bag
Why are we giving this Pelosi so much power?
Propaganda from the Kremlin...I mean white house!  Never thought I would see it!  First step in destroying our freedom of speech and thoughts.  Long live the Free press and our Constitution! Resist and fight!
All he is doing is starving the family's in need

Very proud of my President. I believe President Trump is doing a great job. I support him still.

Not nearly enough shares of this post!  The MSM will not report on it.  Get the message out!!!
Can we impeach Pelosi and Schumer?
Please open the Gov, tell those that are blocking our wall that you will not hold America hostage because of THEIR unwillingness to work with you. You represent US and we need the WALL!!!!!  This completely lays at their feet! This is  on them!
They want numbers TruthPharm Binghamton Ny page look it up !
I am a firm Trump supporter. My opinion may not be like other conservatives. I think Trump should propose a way for those who qualify as DACA young people to become US citizens. It should be fair and relatively easy if they have no serious criminal background. If the president and the Rs did this,it would take the wind out of the sails of the Dems for a long time.🤓

How about firing Nancy she knows everybody wants the wall the government needs to reopen up
This morning I prayed that the Lord would deal with Nancy Pelosi (and others I named specially by name).  I asked Him to give her a short chance to change her heart or, if she will not change, to remove her.  The Word of God says to pray specific prayers.  It also says whatever we ask in Jesus’ name we will receive.  I asked Him not to drag this out.  He will either remove her from office or from this world.  I believe with all my heart in prayer.  Pray the same, and join your prayer with mine.
Several thousand illegals climbed over a fence into New Mexico last night and no one stopped them...several thousand mostly men.  Build the Wall!
So, thoughts and prayers aren't good enough for them? What about all the people killed by the mass shootings that we have almost EVERYDAY?
Gated communities suck. Maybe with proper border control and national sovereignty, we won’t feel the need to have gated communities anymore. Build the wall !
The Republicans are NOT STUPID!!!  Dems WON'T negotiate now, they won't  negotiate EVER, if Trump opens the government now. 😡😡😡😡 Declare a NATIONAL EMERGENCY and build the wall!
Thank you Mr.President.  Build the wall. Because you did not repeat the deep sorrow that understood the commentary of the woman caster and when you should push forward the wall for peace and order improvement even from a part necessary with precedence，I thought personally.
Our borders aren't the problem. You are.
I signed the petition. #BuildTheWall
Like Nancy cares about what Americans want.

Really???? Then why didnt you build the wall when the GOP controlled Congress for last 2 yrs???? Just as I thought, you needed to blame Dems and create chaos as papi Putin asked you to....
Ignore Nancy!  Take a vote from the American people.  Then build the wall.
Is this TRUE - Laura dear, check this please '50 Billion set aside in the 2006 Secure Fence Act'. Can that be true, is it true. If so where did the money go. Where did the taxpayer CASH go, down a sink hole. Was that down south money ??
There is a legal process for entry into America.
Yes, you also promised #NoDACA and #NoAmnesty. Keep your promises.  #MAGA
That’s funny when rival gang members came into my back yard and had a shot out with the gang next door I had a wall put up and guess what no one has gotten back on to my property.
I don't want a wall. They don't work.
Praise God, don’t stop, don’t give in to protecting our citizens President Trump!! As a Texan, we’ve had this problem for way to long!! We as citizens should be as safe as we can!  You’ve came at this appointed time, and you’re doing the Right Thing here! God bless you!!
Scared of...? YES!! Armed Demoncrat THUGS. We ARE working on that...

The democrats new strategy for the 2020 elections. A times reporter stated this on BBC.  Then a senator said the same thing.  President Trump would Not get the money for the wall,  he doesn't have many supporters, and in so many words his supporters are uneducated, drug addicted, deplorable people. This is how they want to keep saying this so the people will believe it. President Trump wants to keep his campaign  promise to build the wall.  The democrats want to make sure he does not keep that promise to the people and lose his supporters, that is there new strategy to win in 2020. I guess the democrats don't know the spirit of a deplorable.
Amen thank you President Trump
So sorry for your loss! Now let all of us build that wall.
God Bless President Trump! You still have a lot of swamp cleanup! Rashida, AOC ETC!

Paul Chiplock North Carolina seems to want the wall.
It's why we voted for him to be our President
Paul Chiplock, got any facts?  Or just blubbering?
why wouldnt they?

Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don’t want this wall.

Tweeto doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results. The very definition of insanity.
Your REAL shutdown is becoming more harmful than the imaginary border crisis.

Awesome! Is your carer Melanie and her son enjoying their break in Florida?  Military plane flying them back to DC? Who's paying?
They just don’t care about Americans, they just hate the Pres nothing else matters ,
This issue of border security has been compromised so many times in the past. Now is the time to take action. No more compromising Congress!
I believe in the Wall and I believe in a secure Border!
First of all she is reading right of a prompter and second can you sound a little more sympathetic like seriously!!! Have some emotion
I’m afraid Mr Trump your fighting a losing battle now that the liberals have the Muslims involved we Republicans are so outnumbered...
Tell Nancy we want impeachment and prison.
Tell Nancy we want impeachment and prison.
That wall was about communist and to re-unite the 2 Germanies... this wall is to keep the illegal, criminal invaders out and have legal immigration enforced!
On this day in 1981, Ronald Reagan was sworn into office, so it seems appropriate to quote him"...tear down that wall!"
Nice! God bless you President Trump!
The swamp creatures are getting dug out of the swamp ! 😊
God Bless the Angel Families and The White House.....🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
You promised to pay all your workers and contractors, ask them how that went. Your promises mean NOTHING >>>
Praying for you sir... along with many other intercessors @ 1:11 pm daily
Best damn President we have had sense Regan!  Stand strong President Trump!   Love everything you are doing! Stand  strong!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please stand firm in demanding the funding for the wall Mr. President. Getting that wall built has been a problem for the American people for a very long time and we finally have hope what was started long ago will finally be accomplished! Don't let the liberal Democrats hold us hostage!
Nancy is committed to the Resistance.  The Democrats will not cave on this, especially the leadership.
Keep up the fight for us.  Prayers for my President.
a wall will not fix illegals and drugs coming in from Mexico...  Florida is surrounded by ocean and people still get desperate enough and find a way into Florida
Time to declare a National Crisis, since hateful Pelosi and crying Schumer won't help to keep us safe.  BUILD the wall. #TRUMP2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Please reopen the government so people can be paid.  federal workers are innocent.
This deal had everything they wanted and Republicans wanted.. so why did Democrats turn it down🤔
Will some one please remind the damn government as a whole who they work for? They don't work for the party. They work for us!!!   Now put up that damn wall and let's move on!
Good job, Mr. President!! Behind you 100 percent.
DO not listen to Ann Coulter or far right folks...stay true and keep fighting
Hey Nancy it is time to stop giving money to other countries and planned parenthood. It is time for our countries security to be first on your to do list.
Protect America and build the wall  Don’t have a fence around your house? If you have it. Why?
Amen Mr President.  I really wish someone would do a forensic audit on the Democratic Party and Mueller in particular.  It is impossible to get a valid number on even just his expenditures much less the entire RNC.
Interesting story about "Joe" the man you picked to sit behind you at rallies  The self-described "good" person--hey Joe-you're not. Figured those folks had to be right out of central casting.
Anyone who doesn't want our borders secure is an enemy of our country
Build the wall and build it now!!!  We support you!!
I don't agree with the DACA deal offered, make them do their jobs and come up with better solution than DACA.

No more DACA!  No more Amnesty. You promised to end ‘‘this criminal illegal Obama activity too.
When you can't act like an adult, you make your own news network? Seriously?
You’re going to be impeached
BUILD THE WALL so people can get back to work!!!! We need this Wall Please dont give up President TRUMP!!! I KNOW YOU WILL NOT
I love you mr. Trump I love the way you scamed senior citizens of there life savings with a phony college! I love the way you grab women's puss+. I love the way you cheated on your wife after she had your son. I love the way with the shutdown your making people lives like hell!        I LOVE YOU MR. PRESIDENT!                          NOT!!
The border is safe and secure!
We need to deport Democrats. we need to open the government. We need to protect the Border. And you mr. President keep doing the right work .🇺🇸🇺🇸MAGA 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸
$5.7B = 230 miles of wall. Knock off the BS and let's start solving real problems.
You have done it from day one and that is why you are president. Thank you so much!
Dear Trump Need negotiate with one way flight to Afghanistan with booze and family with pelosi for border wall!
Call a national emergency President Trump!
I am for Trump 2020 unless he caves for Amnesty
Linda Stienbarger what invasion?
We want the wall.and stop the invasion of our country!!!!!
What we'd really like to hear is what other parts of the very broken immigration system are you looking at? The legalization process for non-resident aliens can take months or years in some cases. And the work visa situation is a huge problem as well. It's not only about border security.
Democrats are so socialistic.  It’s really unbelievable
Happy 2nd anniversary Pres Trump for being our President - inauguration day!   Have a very nice day!!❤️💙🇺🇸
Borders can be safe with other means look into those and stop holding federal workers hostage
Disgusting that the families tried to meet with Pelosi and Schumer and they refused. I wish nature would take its course with those 2.
We don't want a wall.  Put resources into crossing facilities. .. and RESIGN

As President, your main job is to run the government- not shut it down! Please President Trump, open all the government, then work on border security! This government shutdown will go down in history as Republican Trump’s government shutdown, the longest government shutdown in history, and is hurting the Republican Party.
Here we have another illegal killing Americans.  Deport all of them  Man, 19, detained on immigration concerns wanted in 4 Nevada murders  https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-19-detained-on-immigration-concerns-wanted-in-4-Nevada-murders
But I don’t think the wall is the best way to secure the border. Have you seen how many tunnels have been dug lately? There are better technologies available.
Stand strong President Trump! We elected you to do just what you are doing! We stand firm with you! #BuildthatWall!
Thank you for never giving up or getting discouraged!

The US-Canada border is 5,525 miles long and it receives less resources and fewer border agents than the US-Mexico border (which is 1,954 miles.) The number of illegal border crossings along the US-Canada border has increased by 142% in just one year. Fenatyl, Marijuana, Ecstacy and coke are the most common drugs smuggled into our country from Canada. It also serves as an easy entrance for terrorists to enter into the US. Border agents along the US-Canada border have made statements about how easy it is for human trafficking and drug smuggling to slip through, due to the lack of man power and resources. Thousands of traffickers and smugglers illegally cross, completely unnoticed by border security and drawing all of our attention on the Southern border only makes it easier for them to do so. The Northern border is currently a bigger threat to us than the Southern border. Overstayed visas also account for 2/3 of illegal immigration and Canadians are the highest when it comes to over stayed visas
Keep fighting mr.President....build that wall with all cost we are behind u all the way.

I want a wall to stem illegal immigration/invasion of our country.
Angel families? Work on all the Americans killing Americans. It's a much bigger problem.
If the Progressive Democrat Party, an offshoot of communism as is socialism and fascism does not accept Saturday's proposal from President Trump, it is time to adjust the size of the federal government to the funded level and combine the unfunded agencies with the funded government eliminating all nonessential jobs and services. The Progressivism Democrat Party uses Communist tactics and is dysfunctional in a democratic form of government. They are not negotiating because they cannot. Their ideology does not let them.
Yet you allow DACA. Totally pathetic.

I’m amazed that anyone would dessagree to spend money on anything that makes our country more secure. I guess the Dems don’t lock the doors in their homes?
Wasn’t a problem when republicans controlled both houses for the first two years of your presidency. Hmmm.
and yet you have done nothing about it...
Stand firm for the American people!!!🇺🇸❤️
We don’t want a wall. We are all for secure boarders but once again we need to do it in a way that will be more efficient and less expensive. There is a reason we have technology... walls don’t work.
Campaign sponsored propaganda is not "real news".
No Trump, I’m telling YOU that I DON’T want the wall.

So heartbreaking for the true victims! Stand Tall & Stay Strong and NEVER STOP SHARING YOUR TRUTH. God FINALLY sent a President that loves his country and Walks the Walk! May the Blood of Jesus always protect him and his family and may the Voices of these families be heard loudly and be recognized. God Bless!

Ms. Mendozo might want to think about bringing the horror of what she and other Angel families have been put through directly. Obtain crime scene and autopsy photos of their loved ones and show those to the American people and Democrats. I know it's a terrible thing to contemplate, but maybe the stark reality of such horrors will have an impact and help put a stop to such atrocities happening to other families.
i am so very proud of you for standing strong, God bless you President Donald J. Trump. Praying for you daily.
Then hurry up!  Instill e-verify, build the wall, and deport every illegal here!
No wall . . . Resign petty little man.  Please for the sake of a greatful nation.

Overheard: "The only person trump ever hired who was actually qualified to do their job was Stormy Daniels."
Thank you, Mr. President!  Stand strong for our Angel families so we can save others from similar sorrow & loss.
I love the fighter in him.Finally a President with a backbone willing to stand up and fight for the American people.
No one trusts you to fix anything.  Listen to the experts.  The wall would waste funds.  Pelosi made at least six better suggestions.
done...she better settle for the wall
It is not safe where I live as I face the chance if being shot dead.
It should be illegal for democrats in congress to hold the country hostage like this. What if this fight were about gun ownership rights. Stand your ground POTUS. Pelosi will not pass anything and it is making her look worse and worse. Its clear Trump is trying and she is not. Its on her.
Nancy Pelosi,TRUMP IN 2020!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Of course she refused, she's afraid of the truth from these families since it doesn't fit the Democrat rhetoric.

Trump’s propaganda news. Trump’s a disgrace. He needs to be impeached, then imprisoned!
Our government leaders also took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and to "well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office" that they now hold. We believe they are derelict in those duties.
the Democrats have a big heart filled with compassion; they're simply not understanding the millions it's costing us each day - nor the crime coming with a few that enter...
We know President Trump is doing all under his power to stop the killings.
Nancy Pelosi is the one who should be impeached. We need to secure our borders.
We Love You and are behind you! God Bless POTUS, his family, and all White Hats! Thank You for fighting for us. Nancys trip was more important than We The People considering she declined 5 minutes BEFORE your proposal, and left the country anyway. No protection for us I guess.  Unfreakin real.
Lara and the Tone deaf tRump Crime Family Millionaires Tell the Furloughed: DONT worry, be happy! 😤🤬🤮  A ‘Let Them Eat Cake’ Shutdown  Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, gave food to furloughed government workers on Tuesday at the World Central Kitchen in Washington. While tRump’s Swamp Embarrasses Themselves  By Katie Rogers Jan. 24, 2019 WASHINGTON —  Mr. Trump has stocked his administration with millionaires and the garden-variety wealthy who have not been as careful with their messaging, and Democrats are making the most of it.  The ripest target of partisan prey is Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who pads around Washington in $600 embroidered slippers and is known for frequenting high-end restaurants. On Thursday, he expressed confusion about why furloughed federal workers were visiting food banks.  “I don’t really quite understand why” the food bank visits were happening, Mr. Ross, 81, said on CNBC. Some banks were offering interest-free loans, he said, and because the workers would eventually get their back pay, “there’s no real reason why they shouldn’t be able to get a loan against it.”  Asked by reporters to respond to Mr. Ross’s comments, Mr. Trump said that he had not heard them, “but I do understand, perhaps, he should have said it differently.” He went on to suggest that “local people” who operate banks and grocery stores would be understanding of people who have missed pay.  By that time, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, had already called Mr. Ross’s comments “appalling” and further evidence of the administration’s “callous indifference” toward federal workers. But it was Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Mr. Trump’s most visible shutdown adversary, who invoked the French Revolution.  “Is this the ‘let them eat cake’ kind of attitude,” Ms. Pelosi said, “or call your father for money?” — a reference to an earlier taunt of the president after a shutdown meeting.  Larry Kudlow, President Trump’s top economic adviser, insisted he isn’t “out of touch” after he and other members of the administration fumbled their shutdown messaging. He also said his staff are “working for free” because they “believe in President Trump.”   Larry Kudlow, President Trump’s top economic adviser, insisted he isn’t “out of touch” after he and other members of the administration fumbled their shutdown messaging. He also said his staff are “working for free” because they “believe in President Trump.”  But Mr. Ross is not the only one whose remarks required some cleanup. Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, faced days of criticism this week after an interview published Monday in which she said the shutdown amounted to “a little bit of pain, but it’s going to be for the future of our country.”  She appeared Thursday on Fox News to say that she felt for federal workers and that her original comments were taken out of context by the “mainstream media.”  Joining Mr. Ross and Ms. Trump on Thursday was Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser, who turned up in the White House briefing room to tell reporters that the shutdown was “just a glitch” and to defend how connected he was to its effects.  “Am I out of touch?” Mr. Kudlow said. “I don’t think I’m out of touch. I’m addressing the problem.”  Mr. Kudlow also seemed to disagree with a reporter who told him that coming to work during a shutdown was not, in fact, volunteer work because workers “believe in” the president.  “Give them credit, O.K.?” Mr. Kudlow said. “They honor us by their service.”  Mr. Kudlow’s comments drew a rebuke from Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, who suggested that people in the administration meet with workers to learn firsthand of the shutdown’s effects.  “If Mr. Kudlow, Mr. Ross, or literally anyone in this Administration would actually meet with federal workers and listen to their stories,” Mr. Warner said on Twitter, “they’d know how insulting these kinds of comments are.”  Mr. Trump, appears to be listening to the Democratic criticism but not responding to the nuances of it.  On Thursday, he appeared to be watching the news conference where Ms. Pelosi made her reference to Marie Antoinette. As she was speaking, he cherry-picked a snippet of her criticism as a real-time rebuttal for his Twitter feed — one that seemed to miss her larger point about his administration being too out of touch to understand the problem.

The President offered ALL the items the Democrats want as per Nancy Pelosi’s rejection letter except only a three year extension on DACA and TPS recipients into 2022 (well after the next presidential election btw) in exchange for $5.6 billion for physical security on the southern border. Tell me again who is to blame for me continuing to work without a paycheck?? #sendabrick.

We ‘re telling YOU we want that damn wall!
Build our wall - God bless you Mr President
Stop the chain migration!
You made a pledge to yourself.
We tell Nancy to build the wall.  But unlike God, SHE does not listen.
So you expect to make a deal by offering a temporary solution and you expect a permanent wall?  You’re a terrible negotiator.  How about permanent status for the DACA problem for your permanent steel fence?   SMH
Call the state of emergency.  Those caravans keep coming.
Jim Towery you are truly misinformed.   The government contracts out for many specialized services.  Those folks will not get any “back pay”.    Ignorance is the #1 quality of trump supporters.
Susan Urena All the government employees will be paid.  Quit being a snowflake.
Trump & his fans have brought back slavery.  Forced work without pay = slavery.
Why settle for one wall? Let's go for three, and a barred door, for the #FakePresident who is the enemy of the people and the #MoscowPuppet.
You're gonna love President Trump even more once you do your taxes for 2018. Trust me. He is the right person for the people.❤ Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you DJT for your free service our forefathers would be proud of you !
My heart breaks for these families! Build that wall. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🙏🙏🙏

If Hillary won the country would be invading Iran for Israeli interests. Get 9/11 reinvestigated as the Saudi's have ties to Zionist Israel.
Imagine if Hillary had been elected  !
Be cheaper for Nancy to disappear. Ask Clintons
LOVE these updates from Lara Trump, we can't depend on the MSM covering these topics.
Ahhhhh, the latest edition of FAKE News and state sponsored propaganda!  smdh
Angel families?  What about "gold star" families?
So much patience our President has to protect America's citizens.  The wall is so needed and frankly I  don't see where Nancy Pelosi is coming from or whomever agrees with her. Why would she not vote for the wall when the result of not having it will hurt our citizens. Is she anti-American?   Thank you President Trump for the protection!  We need to feel secure in our country!
YOU TELL nancy she and her buddy schumer are out of a job BUT you will give them 3 squares and a cot and a nice orange jumpsuite for the next 30 years
Every president we have had for that past 40 years was going to fix our immigration problem but none of them ever did, they just gave it lip service and kicked the can down the road. Now we finally have a president that is actually trying to get the problem taken care of and everyone is having a cow. Keep up the fight President Trump, the people are behind you and want the immigration problem fixed and our border secured.
Thank you President Trump for standing strong for all of us. You are our voice!
Nancy is stubborn as a mule !!!!!!
THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT.  BUILD THE WALL.

Trump negotiated to help a million illegals - dreamers, yet it was still rejected.  How much is it costing to support a million illegals??? And it still isn't good enough. They oppose everything that Trump stands for, and not in the best  interest of the USA.

No No Nancy is letting drugs flow across the non existent safe border. Time to tell her That’s a no no!
Holding American Citizens HOSTAGE is NOT the American Way. Trump needs to end the Humanitarian Crisis HE CREATED in This Country and OPEN the Government NOW!
Each refugees costs tax payers $82k per year. Democrats vote harvest
She knows she can’t tell the truth
Sorry, Lara. I can't see your face and not think of the horrible misleading media about racing greyhounds that you've been a part of. HSUS and grey2k are nothing but FAKE NEWS and you deserve to be a part of the truth, not their false agenda. Find some greyhound people and discover the truth
STAND FIRM MR PRESIDENT!
Giving amnesty  to  illegals  is  NOT  going  to  make  our  country  safer.

They are trying to breed out the Conservative vote
The only people who are keeping the government shut down are Trump and McConnell, who refuses to let the Senate do their job to vote on bills...like the ones that will open the government without any strings attached, which are sitting in the Senate and which the Democrats already passed in the house (and which are identical to prior ones that the Senate had unanimously passed).

Mr. President Donald J. Trump I think you should avoid any amnesty deal .  The country is already on the brink and the only thing you'll do is weaponize the illegals against America's interests.  These are the same people (who are citizens via the legal process) waving Mexican flags and voting for democrats in lopsided 80% numbers.  This IS a national security crisis!  I think every military member I know would GLADLY, FREELY take a $50 billion hit, much less a paltry $5 billion hit, to secure that border and put concrete in the ground to prevent tunneling!  So what if we have a few crumbling military buildings??  That is a cheap price to pay to block our displacement and conquest by demographics without a shot being fired

Ottavio Esquivel... you are on the wrong page here go post to your own president in Costa Rica!
It is normal, democratic, American politics for the executive and legislative branches of government to bargain & negotiate over competing policy preferences. It is not normal, democratic, or American for the paychecks of workers to be held hostage while doing so.
Whose going to pay for the wall?  https://www.facebook.com/1087167058116488/posts/1188671814632678?sfns=cl  Trump lied....over and over and over again.  When he said,”I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,” he wasn’t calling you loyal; he was calling you STUPID.
Anyone know about how much it costs to support illegals we have right now for a year?
Easy fix for all those in favor of making the term illegal immigration, sponsor a family into your homes no background check welcome them into your homes making it a legal immigration, so basically put your money where your mouthes are, with all the free stuff they get or drug money or human trafficking money they can pay you rent

“He is shutting down the government to break his signature campaign promise. His signature campaign promise was that the taxpayers weren’t going to have to pay for it.” The House Armed Services Committee Chairman said on “This Week.”
Ottavio Esquivel if the wall is built Billions of tax dollars that are spent yearly will be on the decline, the ileagals get wealfare, bring in high amounts of drug dollars, work for cash and send your tax dollars in the Billions back to their country. In a big way Mexico would be paying for the wall in the way of spending less tax dollars on them

Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?

Just STOP ALL Mexico and S. American aid because we are clearly wasting that money and for what really?  Declare a Nat’l Emergency, Shut the Border and #BuildTheDamnWallAndThrowTheStupidOverIt!  Use the foreign aid money we would be sending to them to build the wall mile by mile until it’s done!

You know I just dont understand. President Trump was voted into the office of President by the people of the United States, that should be the end of it. He was voted in and is trying to do what is best for those (us) people. So let him, if you didn't like what he stood for you shouldn't of voted for him. Last time I checked to win the Presidency you have to have the most votes. So I would think the majority of people who voted think he knows what he doing, right? Then let him do it.

It's amazing how these democratic leaders care more about illegals than they do the American people. They're argument is also hypocritical, they think it's not right to have a wall to try and protect our country, but they all live in gated communties to try and protect they're homes!

CALL TO ACTION ::: Get Pelosi removed as Speaker by a vote of NO CONFIDENCE. Pelosi is not dealing in good faith for our country.   Citizens - write a letter, make a call....  lobby your Congress person asking that they put forth a motion to elect someone else as Speaker of the House.  The majority party can put forth a vote of NO CONFIDENCE- if successful followed by a new election for a speaker.

Thank you Mr. President for all you do for us.  The letter Nancy wrote to you uninviting you for the State of the Union, should you decide the wall is a crisis, proves Nancy thinks it's a crisis too. All the proof you need! She drew that conclusion without even conferring with Homeland security and other top officials!
Do the SOTU from a ballroom in the WH. Invite Angel Families to sit in the front with pictures of their loved ones. Television affords the opportunity to cut away and show graphics - charts, clips etc... use a pie chart to show how small that 5 billion is when compared to the budget. Show clips of illegals throwing rocks at Border Patrol. Show an empty seat for Pelosi and Shumer.

So, Pelosi won't talk to angel families, she won't donate the $1.00 she said she would give to Brian Kolfage for the wall, her voice mail box is full, she's joined at the hip with Chuckie Schumer (Nan-Chick-It), and she absolutely will not negotiate with our great President Trump for the wall - she said it was a non-starter even before she heard the proposal. Do we need any more proof that this "elite" will not listen to THE PEOPLE? TRUMP2020 MAGA. This is the best country on earth, and she wants to lead people to destroy it.

Elizabeth, I know that. That’s all you took away from that fact? Point is, IAs are costing American taxpayers billions of dollars annually (again, $22 billion in Cal alone each year) that should be spent on American citizens. So taxpayers are paying. Out the ass. And it needs to stop.
Claudine Sherman Abraham That's not an IRS refund. 🙄

I want to know how Pelosi was even allowed to run for public office again? Did we all forget she stole tax payer dollars to fly her and her family across the country? Mr. President, ask Nancy Pelosi if she has reimbursed the tax payers money. I am a father of four, I do concrete, brick amd block for a living, I got an overpayment from unemployment and had to pay the overpayment plus a very large penalty of $500 so I believe she should have to pay a penalty of 25% of every dollar she stole from the tax payers, she knowingly defrauded the tax payers.

If you gave the vetted dreamers a path to citizenship.   Get them a social security number and have them paying for insurance.  No more freebies.  I don’t get a Lonestar card for free groceries.

They just take, take, take  With no regard for the future of the the greatest Country in the World.  USA.    Again thank you for your service

So Pelosi states "NO" prior to the speech. She and her group want the Gov't opened, then they will proceed to "talk". Let's see now: You loan me $500,000 now, and later we will "talk" & I will agree to sign the Contract, well maybe and maybe NOT. Hilarious ! Or is there a problem with what sits above the neck on the LEFT ? That is an assumption that others are as dumb as you are.

btw : MAGA.  President Trump puts together an honest effort to cooperate and end the shut-down amid an environment of absolutely tragic immaturity and lies.. the scary thing is : time is still ticking and running out.  There aren't too many more "Trumps" out there.  THANK GOD TRUMP HAS GREAT KIDS! ( and I am looking 20 to 30 years into the future here)
and in case FB is censoring it (its only showing a link which you may not "click on"--> it says 800,000 federal workers are not getting paid but 20 million non-citizens are so build the wall is essentially what the meme says.

Border wall and border security definitely provides protection, but if the wall is not built then foreign aid to build nations to prevent war and a recession would be affected. United States generous foreign aid to nations is vital to prevent a world war and economic disaster due to climate change

I am 100% with you President Trump for border security, but you should be taking away the paychecks of all members of Congress democrat and republican until this shut down is over.  Keep paying the American people that are affected because of this.  Can you imagine what they are going through not having any money coming in for their families because Congress isn't doing their job!!

Vicious, heartless bargaining chip on the lives of the American people! Trump is the National crisis! Trump is the National emergency! Resign!

I have a question: The Wall has to do with National Security, right? Do ALL matters of 'national security' have to be approved by Congress? I do NOT know how everything works, & I do not know exactly what the Constitution says about this, but it seems to me that, IF a thing is a matter of National Security, the decisions would be made directly by Homeland Security & maybe those in the Pentagon, military leaders & such. Don't they have a budget that is to be used for whatever they need to secure the United States? WHY does it have to be approved by the Legislative branch???***  Since protecting the country & the citizens in it, is one of the primary things that the fed.gov. Is SUPPOSED to do....The Wall isn't anything NEW; it is simply something that HAS been approved of before, but was not acted upon. WHY does it have to be approved again? SERIOUSLY WANTING TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS!* Thanks!*                                                 (( HOW did obama sneak that huge amount of money, cash, without us knowing it? AND, IF Schumer made a proposal for 25 billion for a 'border fence' & border security in 2013, then was that money used up? & if not, where did it go & why isn't IT being used? AND, there certainly hasn't been 700 miles of fencing or wall built, probably EVER!  We've seen pictures. Pathetic.(I read Politifact; it said that that proposal didn't get picked up by the House after it went thru the Senate in 2013) AND, when the left speaks of a 'fence'...hahaha....EVERYONE KNOWS  a fence won't keep out those wanting to climb & dig under a fence, OUT. A 'fence' is a joke, & it's just to pacify.  Pelosi says that to have a 'wall',is not what our country(ok, nancy....EXPLAIN...what is our country???) .....Well, I SAY, OUR GREAT COUNTRY IS NOT A DOORMAT!****AND, we're not into SLOPPY UN-DISCIPLINED OPERATIONS.*To just allow anyone to come & trample on it's land, laws or principles, & try to take over.....just so the oldies in the congress can have dem votes.....now THAT'S Pathetic.....You know what??? Hahahaha! IF the DACA people get to stay, after they get really situated & become citizens, I bet they'll ALL VOTE REPUBLICAN!* Cause they will have seen enough of the dem confusion & chaos.I bet California WILL go Red! Cause when things get so bad, people revolt....& the chaos is coming from the left, not the right. I don't know, but maybe by then, there'll be a Nationalist party or a stronger Libertarian Party, etc. & maybe dems will change their name to 'socialist party'. >>Draining the swamp-----WWG1WGA 👍🇺🇸

The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.
The Bill of Rights lists ten specific Human Rights, which are “inalienable” and “endowed by our Creator”, such that no government can grant Rights, or take them away.  According to the Constitution of the Unites States, these Rights “shall not be violated” and “shall not be infringed”.  In fact, “Congress shall make no law to abridge” them.    Each of these Ten Rights is delineated below.  Parenthetically, current examples of a legislative code, act or agency which has since abridged each Right, follows.  There are too many examples of Abridged Rights to list, so only a couple are provided for each.  Read the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations for a full list!  All Ten Rights under the Bill of Rights are now abridged, revoked or restricted.  Having also legislatively erased the Separation of Powers, and the Definition of Free People; the U.S. Constitution is consequently null and void; and no law, act, or code, is legally enforceable.  The U.S. Government currently operates without any constitutional authority, just like every other oligarchical organized crime syndicate, and You Simply Have No Rights.  We can’t even use their own laws against them, because they exempted themselves from virtually every law they’ve written.  In other words, it was a bait and switch from day one, and we are still falling for it.    1.	Freedom of Religion, both the establishment and practice thereof. (IRC Section 501(c)(3); 98 US 145; 494 US 872; 374 US 398) 2.	Freedom of Speech, Press and all forms of Expression. (Federal Communications Commission, 413 US 15; 484 US 260; 509 F. 2d 1133) 3.	Freedom to Peaceably Assemble and Protest the Government. (HB 347; 491 US 147, 150-51; 534 US 316, 322; 312 US 569, 575-76) 4.	Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms. (107 Stat. 1536; 307 US 174; 48 Stat. 1236; 350 Fed. Appx. 874; 701 F. 3d 81) 5.	No Soldier shall be Quartered in any House without Consent of the Owner. (National Defense Authorization Act requires taxpayers to fund all housing of soldiers whether they agree with the taxes and use of the militia or not.) 6.	Freedom to be Secure in your Persons, Houses, Papers, and Effects; Against Unreasonable Searches and Seizures. (The Patriot Act, the National Security Administration.) 7.	No Person Shall be Held to Answer for a Capital, or otherwise Infamous Crime, unless on a Presentment or Indictment of a Grand Jury. (National Defense Authorization Act subsection 1022, Title X, Subtitle D) 8.	In all Criminal Prosecutions, the Accused Shall enjoy the Right to a Speedy and Public Trial, by an Impartial Jury. (National Defense Authorization Act allows for infinite detention with no trial or due process.  See subsection 1021) 9.	In Suits at Common Law, where the Value in Controversy Shall exceed Twenty Dollars, the Right of Trial by Jury Shall be Preserved. (Small Claims Court, 293 US 474; 118 US 545, 553; 319 US 372, 389) 10.	Excessive Bail Shall not be Required, nor Excessive Fines Imposed, nor Cruel and Unusual Punishments Inflicted. (Death Penalty, Infinite Detention, Forced Military Service, No Bail, Mandatory Minimum Sentences. 18 US 359 1(b); 84 Stat. 1236; 10 US 246)

When it is made an ultimatum to get votes for Pelosi, that’s a bit different.
Dean Clouse if you would kindly do your research you will find that the terms have been talked about for years. Spoke about when Reps held the House. Old news. BTW doesn't matter anymore anyway. Just like Chump being Pres. It don't matter anymore coz here we are dealing with both of them.
You’re a bit out of touch with majority apparently. Hell, majority of democrats didn’t even want Nancy as Speaker! She had to agree to term limit as speaker for them to vote for her.

Dean Clouse what on God's green earth has this Russian spy done for America? Oh right! A Yuuuge tax cut for his billionaire buddies and CEO friends..have you seen the deficit since he took office? You know 200 indictments ago...The U.S. Treasury reported that October’s deficit was $100 billion, an increase of $37 billion or 58% from a year ago. While one month may not be a trend, it puts the full-year deficit on a path from $779 billion in fiscal 2018 to $1 trillion in fiscal 2019. He's a business genius? lol suckers!
Dean Clouse Yeah. No. Not sure if you have noticed but the majority of Americans do not want this.

If I was Trump I'd set up a scheduled meeting for Nancy Pelsoi in the oval office. But I'd lock the door and laugh and laugh and laugh when she stood on the other side saying "I can't get in!" Teach a man to fish. Walls do work. That's why we have walls.

Sorry Chammy Ney Ney Jr..  I tagged the wrong peson...This question is intended for James Ahssanipoor. So here it is ole buddy.   James thinks Hillary Clinton did NOT have textual relations with that server.  I mean........ anyone could accidentally delete 33,000 e-mails that would incriminate them. Right? He wants Hillary Clinton back in the white house with Bill Clinton by her side. That way Bill coud have wild passionate monkey love in the oval office on TAXPAYER'S money. Hey James. .. Did you know that Monica Lewinsky had a birthday recently? She's in her 50's now. It seams like only yesterday that she was crawling around the white house floor putting anything she could find in her mouth. They grow up so quickly these days. Don't ya think so James? Hillary Clinton will screw over America in a Benghazi minute.... but just answer this question James.... If you didn't vote for Trump,  who'd ya vote for and why? That's a VERY simple question. A simple answer will do just fine.

Chammy Ney Ney Jr.  the best ever idiot, if u do not believe. Please google
Donald, a thrice-married cheat, has a credibility problem. He asked for $1.6 billion, appropriations committee said "OK", then he said nevermind make it $5 billion, House said "OK", then he said actually $5.7 billion PLUS let's shutdown the government, and he struck no deals until the opposing party took the House away January 3. YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH LIARS.  So forget Donald, he is just fooling around. He's changed the terms before and he'll do it again, so just bypass him with a veto-proof majority.  Why? Because air traffic controllers. Because ICE. Because US Coast Guard. Because TSA. Because America is open for business, even if president bone spur isn't.  Veto-proof majority, just bypass the useless lying cheating bone spur.
Dodd Gross but who is being investigated? Not Obama and not Hillary. And your idiot president thinks there is a wall around San Antonio. It doesn't get any more stupid than that.

Larry Mitchell well, apparently it does by your comment. And you are wrong about them not being investigated. I read just yesterday killiary has to account for her deleted email, they want to question her again. Ohr just testified, a lot of people are nervous about that, esp. Mueller, who knew the dossier hadn't been verified yet still went ahead to obtain a warrant. Ignoring the facts as they are is typical of the left. The hatred for our President, doesn't allow anything else in those little brains of yours.

James Ahssanipoor  How come you never answered my question in my comment. It's such a simple question. Stop sidestepping it. Who'd ya vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? Did you like where this country was heading? Men using the bathroom with your wife and daughter? Which Obama accomplishments do you consider to be his best?  I'm curious. Hillary would have continued down the same roads, but I'll ask the question again. Who'd ya vote for and why? Surely you have a reason?

James Ahssanipoor  When are you going to stop circling the airport and land the plane? I've asked you a VERY simple question 3 times. I'll ask it again. Who did you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? Your CFO of your company. Surely it ain't gonna be that hard for you to answer. So stop sidestepping it. Ya want to stop circling the airport and bring it in for a landing? Who'd you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why?

James Ahssanipoor  I was talking about Hillary Clinton's records that were stored on a private server in her basement. Try to keep up. You're a CFO. You should pay more attention to detail... You know...the ones that were on all those smashed e-mail servers? But we all know those 33,000 deleted e-mails that would incriminate her was only an accident.  I mean..... that kind of stuff is ALWAYS happening to folks. Right? Geeeeezzzzzaloo.. to be CFO and NEVER work, you sure come up with some goofball comments! Just sayin....
James Ahssanipoor Your sister😂





James Assinhand barley out of diapers at 25🤡
James Ahssanipoor  STILL circling the airport. You said who cares about Hillary. That's something we agree on. I didn't want her back in the white house either. That's why I voted for Trump. So I'm gonna ask another time. Who did you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? It's such a simple question. How come you're not willing to answer the question? A smart CFO like yourself shouldn't have a bit of problem coming up with a very quick answer. How come it's taking so long....you never answered my question?

I've read every one of them. ALL that I asked for is for you to say I voted for....   Because...... But I guess that's just too difficult for a CFO that says they NEVER work. It actually requires a minimum amount of WORK. Really not difficult. You're just not willing to answer the question because I'll make you look stupid.  Too late pal. By NOT answering. You already do.  Just sayin.....

Dang! I just wish I had that CFO money that ole James Ahssanipoor makes. That way I could pay someone to do that for me. That dude says he NEVER has to work because he's obviously rich. You know....  being CFO and trader and all. He's not conceited either! He's just convinced! BAHAHAHAHA  You've at least been VERY cheap entertainment James. Have a nice day sir. 😂

Joseph R Phipps oh god don't even start. Obama is gone now. And all you people do is deflect to him and Hillary. Its getting old and sad.  Do you even have a clue what Trump is doing to the environment. Maybe ask a family that lives near a structure that is back polluting again because of him.  Obama did not have the longest job loss streak ever. You sound like Trump just spouting nonsense. Its pathetic.
Kelly Cross Sr Jr Senator "O" first pushed to disarmed Ukraine #2 guy FBI says Russia interfered in 08-12 elections 08 Georgia/Russia conflict O doesn't want US involvement O pushes Facebook and Google to build a silicon valley in Moscow for Putin's military intelligence complex O tells Putin he'll be more flexible after the election O removes missile defense systems Putin didn't like O lets Putin move into Syria After telling Ukraine we would protect them O lets Russia invade O covers for Putin/Russia election interference until late 2016  Looks like your "Boy" was working with the enemy of America 🤡

Joseph R Phipps a reset button is better than being Putin's puppet! Don't you think? Putin is enjoying every minute with Trump as president.  He's drinking vodka with his buddies like "I so own this guy!!"
More Americans pessimistic about Trump's presidency than any presidency in last 25 years  His strongly disapprove rating in the Marist poll, at 45% this week, tied his previous all-time high for that pollster. By the Quinnipiac University poll's reading, his strongly disapprove rating stands at 50%. These are very high strong disapproval ratings. Trump is as strongly disliked now as President Richard Nixon was when he resigned in 1974.  CNN

Joseph R Phipps but Obama had 8 years and he is friends with the Bushes now. You think any ex president would ever be friends with traitor Trump? I think that's a hard no. Thank god there's no chance in hell we will have 8 years with this chump. We might not even have 4 years with the way he's going!

Trump’s Slippage in Support is Real  The slippage is the worst kind—the slow erosion of support from key blocs: swing voters (independents and suburbanites) and those who put Trump over the top (blue collar white men and Republicans over 60).  It’s been registering in a cross section of polling data, not just one poll. Trump’s job approval rating is down to 31 percent among independents in Gallup. His approval ratings in Rasmussen are down from the 48-49 percent range of late last year to the 43-44 percent level of the past week or so. The Marist data for PBS shows a drop of 10 percent in job approval among Republicans and a decline of 11 percent among white evangelicals and 17% among suburban men.  And Trump continues to enrage the Dem base while this erosion in his base continues to progress. Blue collar white men being turned off from Trump shouldn’t surprise anyone, for they know the difficulty of living paycheck to paycheck. This, plus the skew of the tax cut package, spells political trouble for Trump long term, especially if a slow down, much less a recession, looms in 2020.  Bulwark

Sonja Sherrod So which is it? O was lying then or "Dims" are lying now 🤡 Mr. Trump raised concerns pursuant to the election being rigged, Obama lashed out at him. In October, literally only days before the election, speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Obama swung at Mr. Trump, saying: “This is just more than the usual standard lie. That is not a joking matter. That is dangerous because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in other people’s minds about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy.” It’s worth noting that America is not a democracy, but I digress.🤡  "Dims" spent the next two years blaming Russia hacked the election🤡

They have even hacked into our electrical grids ECT. So I don't know if Putin has a tape of Trump peeing on underage hookers or what. Russia is not our ally.  Sorry but Mueller is VERY busy with Trumps crimes. Is it even possible for you to debate without bringing up past presidents? Who by the way aren't under investigation.

As soon as the Dems took the house, he called it an Emergency  ..lol  The house and the senate agreed on a budget  deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!   The Trump administration tried to dismantle DACA, that shields approximately 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation, in the fall of 2017, but a prolonged court battle has kept the initiative alive. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also announced the eventual termination of TPS protections for more than 250,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Honduras, Sudan and Haiti, but a federal judge blocked the decision in early October.  Now he says he’ll give a temporary stay for them, something he took away.. for his 5.7 none border he PROMISED and GARENTEEED ! Mexico would pay for... lol … yes more barriers where immigration says it needs, not 5.7 billion for his dumb wall, MAJOIRTY of drugs come in cars at ports of entry, FACT!
DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old. Here are 30 ways Americans are feeling the pain:  1. 450,000 public workers are being made to work without pay, including members of the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, Border Patrol, FBI, and Secret Service. 2. 350,000 public workers have been temporarily laid off. 3. Tens of thousands of federal contractors have been laid off for a month, including janitors, security guards, and cafeteria workers. They are losing up to $200 million a day.

Nearly 10,000 companies that do business with the U.S. government are losing money, according to the Washington Post. 5. Pop-up food banks have opened up to feed unpaid government workers. 6. The four week shutdown is costing the U.S. $200 million a day, or almost $6 billion so far according to analysis by The New York Times. 7. Unpaid TSA workers have been calling in 'sick' or quitting, leading to longer security lines and missed flights. Some airports have begun closing terminals. 8. The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9. Air Traffic Controllers, who were already suffering a 30-year staffing low, have been feeling the strain of going unpaid. Some have begun quitting. 10. With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21. The FTC's identity theft reporting system is shut down. 22. Student loans are being delayed as universities are unable to verify parents' income with the IRS 23. Small Business Administration loans have been delayed. 24. Domestic violence shelters that receive federal funds have been forced to cut services. 25. Highway and transit projects are being delayed or canceled. 26. Wildfire preparations in western states are delayed. 27. The National Hurricane Center's research has been delayed 28. The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo are closed. 29. Funding for Section 8 housing assistance has lapsed, placing low-income families at risk of eviction. 30.

Chammy Ney Ney Jr.   Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S. Constituents, if you ‘like’ this, like it whenever you see it.   https://m.facebook.com/The-Great-1461-Day-Adventure-360025854356893/

Russians understand better than anyone what socialism and communism.Behind the attractive slogans is the tragedy of the country and every family.And our President puts his life and health to protect our beloved America from this disaster.I would have forced all Democrats to study the history of the creation and fall of the Soviet Union.If Russia had been told in 1916 that a revolution would have taken millions of lives of three generations in 1917,no one would have believed it.I pray for our President and his victory in this struggle.

Having a hard time understanding how our politicians have decided to become the representatives of illegals. Got all the time in world for some illegals and none for Americans. Hand out our money to people who materialize out of thin air practically. Stop pussyfooting around and build it. The progressives in both parties are never going to consent even tho they know it’s what we need. Time to see how much cartel money is in Congress and senate.

I believe that TRUMP will be the last American president who will fight as hard for America as he does, all future republican presidents will fold because of their fear of the democraps calling them names like they always do.

We could spend 5 billion on domestic violence prevention/education and programs to help women get out of abusive relationships without being murdered; veteran programs that actually meet the needs of our vets (mental health/medical care/housing/job training); drug prevention and rehabilitation programs in high poverty areas. There are so many things that wall money could be used for to stop Americans from dying.

Except for the American people were forced to accept Obamacare which has become unaffordable and fined if they didn't obey. Thank god Trump took those fines away. The only ones holding this country hostage are the Democrats who refuse to negotiate out of hate. Get your facts straight.

Debbie Avdoyan Spiers the Obama administration had months of hearings on healthcare. Obama actually wanted universal healthcare but because of the opposition from the republicans he   used the Republicans healthcare bill that you are now opposed to.  Speaking of crooks you support the biggest traitor to this country.

Mary Hillgrove the majority of Americans are in support of the affordable healthcare and protested the Republicans not to take it away. The Republicans have convinced you for eight years that this was a bad insurance plan even though it was Mitt Romney's plan, a Republican.  The Republicans were in control of ALL three branches of government for two years and they could not even agree on a plan to replace it. The only legislation put forth were to give the wealthiest people richer.

Nope. That's just a nice convenient position that sound reasonable, but the hard truth and argument against that relaxed attitude is, that if that was the case, the wall could have been erected by now, based on an agreement made long ago. The socalled "gun" you so highly claim has in fact just been drawn recently.  It's a bit two-tongued...first denying making any agreement at all under any circumstances. Then denying making any agreement, because of "a gun" and claiming, that a deal could have been made if the "gun" hasn't been drawn.. Come on

Norene Boone He didn’t really have a majority. He didn’t have all the Republicans either. It takes 60 % in the Senate to pass bills. He is fighting a group in Congress who want and like the way things are. They don’t want change like some people want. They want power and money. Even term limits may not stop it and most if not all of them would never vote for term limits. Call it what you want, but we have a stalemate. And we are getting nothing of value to us and or the country.  The only things we have gotten in the last two years came from Executive Order. I for one do not want a dictatorship where one person rules. I like what we should have and I think it’s worth fighting for.

Bryan Allen Social Security and medicare support themselves. They are not increasing the debt. The tax break for the wealthy, Trumps constant visits to his properties, his cabinets excess spending. Those are whats increasing the debt. The dems are in agreement for broader security however it has to make sense. Why have a broader wall and its know that tunnels are build under walls.

Tim Stump don't forget that the reason insurance is increasing is because this administration has taken bits and pieces of it to the point it does not work the way its suppose to. With that being said the Republicans had two years to replace and fix those problems but they instead fought amongst themselves. I can sleep at night knowing that if someone needs assistance because they are sick we can help. Instead of blaming and being angry and fearful of people that come to this country for a better life why don't you focus your attention and the wealthy who are currently controlling this country and making it harder for the middleclass.

Steven Whitehead the reason why the majority of the country do not like this president is because he has no idea what he is doing. He is currently under investigation for helping Russia rig an election. Because he is a conman. Because he does not care about the American people and the was proven by his speech yesterday. Never mention the people out of work at all.

Norene: Obama held the American's hostage for Obamacare. He then overreached his power & signed into law the DACA program which is an illegal program. Anything to do with immigration must be passed by Congress not by EO...They wouldn't pass it so he basically said "screw you I'm signing an EO for it". You asked if walls would protect someone. Do your fences protect you? Do your doors protect you? Why do you have them then if you feel these aren't protecting you? I grew up in Nogales, AZ...Believe me it is in a crisis situation.

Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Todd Cuson   That's a different problem with a different solution. Fact is, people cross the border illegally where no wall or barrier exists. It needs to stop completely NO more.
More Canadians are overstaying their visas than Mexicans. A wall does nothing to help that.

Question: Which Party Platform is egotistical and which is Altruistic in nature? Politics are very simple to understand. There is a balance in between "The needs of the many out-way the needs of a few" AND "A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link" If we find the sweet spot in those two things we will live in heaven on earth. President Trump is thee closest we have come to this line of thinking in our history as a country.

Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Because of the actual ways they are getting in. Not everyone travels 80 miles through desert and very rough terrain heading to where you don't know.
You said Mexico will pay for it. Now you shut down the government you lied.
Because most Americans know it has nothing to do with security but is only an ego stroke for the orange groper.

Victoria A. Deobald I thought you republicans love Israel. FYI, Israel has terrorist lobbing explosives into Israel. We don't have terrorists lobbing explosives over the boarder. That is a piss poor argument.
Susan Diane 1. you are ten times more likely to get killed by an American white guy than an illegal immigrant. 2. No one is born here illegally. If you are born here you are a US citizen. Check the constitution. 3. There are many more American crime gangs than illegal immigrant gangs. 4. Every immigrant, even illegal ones pay sales taxes, income tax and social security. They don't get tax refunds nor are they eligible for social security benefits.

Webster Lynn Vi but the wall won’t keep stop most illegal immigration- mist fly in and overstay visas. I would rather our taxpayer dollars to sorting that out than building a silly wall that people can tunnel under, cut or climb over.
One of the central theses of this feed has been that Trump had a legal obligation to do nothing to aid/abet Russian cybercrimes after August 17, 2016, when he received his first classified briefing as a candidate and learned of Putin's cyberwar. Today we learned he did just that.  Today we learned that Trump was discussing unilateral sanctions relief with the Kremlin (via Sessions) *and* floating the idea of a gifted $50 million penthouse in Moscow for Putin (via Cohen and Sater) *and* negotiating a massive Trump Tower Moscow deal post-August 17, 2016. The focus of the collusion conversation has always been exclusively conspiracy. In Proof of Collusion I argued that two dozen crimes could be collusive; then, once Ben Wittes said obstruction could be collusion, everyone took note. Well aiding and abetting is *also* collusion.  Remember that what we call the Trump-Rozov deal (the 2015 Trump Tower Moscow deal, as opposed to the 2013 Trump-Agalarov deal) was being negotiated *with the Kremlin*. You *cannot* learn that Putin is in a hot cyberwar with America and keep negotiating a deal with the Kremlin.  Remember that, as of August 17, 2016, Donald Trump was one of the few civilians in the *world* with a legally cognizable level of certainty that the Kremlin was engaged in a hot cyberwar against America. His obligations from then on were therefore *special* and *justiciable*. The only reason Giuliani was willing to admit today that Trump was negotiating with the Kremlin up until Election Day is that media has so doggedly (but wrongly) said that conspiracy is the only collusion charge relevant to Mueller's probe that Trump's team came to believe it.  I think the problem that we're going to have now is that media is so invested in this grave misconception of how to use the term "collusion" in discussing Mueller's work that there's a chance the full import of what Rudy confessed to today will be missed and not reported upon.  The important thing is this: if Giuliani is willing to say this publicly, it means he's either certain Mueller already has this information from another source, or sure that information at *least* this bad about the Trump-Kremlin negotiations is certain to come out eventually. when I say "today we learned" I don't actually mean "today we learned." Readers of this feed and readers of Proof of Collusion already knew about Trump's aiding and abetting. What I mean is "today all America learned."-

Meanwhile, mainstream news outlets are not reporting that homelessness is “exploding” out on the west coast.  For instance, we are being told that there are “1000's of unauthorized tent camps” in the city of Seattle alone…  Housing prices are soaring here thanks to the tech industry, but the boom comes with a consequence: A surge in homelessness marked by 1000+ unauthorized tent camps in parks, under bridges, on freeway medians and along busy sidewalks. The liberal city is trying to figure out what to do.  But I thought that the Seattle economy was doing so well.  I guess not.  Down in San Diego, they are actually scrubbing the sidewalks with bleach because the growing homeless population is spreading hepatitis A everywhere…  San Diego now scrubs its sidewalks with bleach to counter a deadly hepatitis A outbreak. In Anaheim, 1000+ people sleep along a bike path in the shadow of Angel Stadium. Organizers in Portland lit incense at an outdoor food festival to cover up the stench of urine in a parking lot where vendors set up shop.  Over the past two years, “at least 10 cities or municipal regions in California, Oregon and Washington” have declared a state of emergency because homelessness has gotten so far out of control.  Nice Job Nancy?  Lori Williams posted 1/19/2019-  We have a huge homeless population here in the Antelope Valley, California's high desert. Every under/overpass, vacant field, and any place they can pitch a tent...not to mention store fronts. They're begging in parking lots, gas stations, medians, and even coming into the business where I work. Our homeless shelter closed for lack of funds, and I won't go out after dark anymore. If they do manage to move them, hazmat has to come and clean up after them. But hey, let's allow even more people in that we can't care for, sad.  -------------------- That is all.....

They're begging in parking lots, gas stations, medians, and even coming into the business where I work. Our homeless shelter closed for lack of funds, and I won't go out after dark anymore. If they do manage to move them, hazmat has to come and clean up after them. But hey, let's allow even more people in that we can't care for, sad.  -------------------- That is all.....
Thank you Anne
Thank you Anne
Love you idiot Northerners spewing your bs. I live here, drugs come across the border daily by human transport. You have no clue wtf you are talking about.
Bill Klein So can the idiots who are blocking what we want...you might take notice that this country voted Donald Trump into office..whether, or not, you want to believe it...it's true. We voted him into office because of the platform he ran on.  I can't imagine what kind of trouble this country would be in if the big cities made all of our decisions.  Thank God for the electoral college.

I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can’t fool everyone. Open the government !

MJ  Stark, yes I do have a job! I have a job because of President Trump! Before all the deregulation I was unemployed for a little over a year! My last employer let 130 employees go and sent our jobs straight to Mexico. President Trump addresses everything most of us were concerned about. To top things off, my wife and I make more money than we ever have. Our standard of living has improved greatly and I am 57 years old!
MJ  Stark - Wake up, we are all forking out money for illegals everyday!  Annual cost of illegal immigration: OVER $84 BILLION. Yet Democrats will NOT spend 5 BILLION to keep Americans safe & stop drugs. Wake up Taxpayers! #BuildTheWall 🇺🇸

Don, apparently you are still going to work every day or earning some kind of money to keep a roof over your head and food on your table. And you have the compassion of your President. That would be none.

Months ago, thinking that the GOP would pick up seats in the House, Trump approved $129M in funding to hire staff in the House of Rep.  He thought the funds could be used to investigate Clinton.  Democrats won and now Pelosi has this money to hire lawyers to investigate Trump!!

How is a freaking wall gonna stop that.  A waste of your MONEY

A woman who works for TSA has breast cancer and is trying to decide if you should pay her mortgage or have her chemo. This is an outrage !!

Pat shaw, all I actually saw was wall and trump. Obviously no comprehension in all wall supporters...
Arturo Elroy Mañana Really 🙄 You obviously didn’t read my comments or can’t comprehend!
Pat Shaw, they rarely escape because of the “armed” guards go figure.  Lenny guidroz, is that all you could come up with who’s the “moron” here?
Arturo Elroy Mañana you're a "MORON"!!
Arturo Elroy Mañana I want border security and if a wall helps with that, I would rather use that method other than shooting immigrants!! No one single thing is going to work but a wall is a deterrent. We use walls around prisons to help keep the bad guys in, they seem to be doing the job! An escape now and then? Maybe, but nothing is fail proof just added defense! What’s wrong in a steel fence with razor wire to help the men and women of the border patrol in protecting our country? I think it’s not the Wall, you have a problem with, it’s who will get kudos for actually making it a reality!! TRUMP!

Jennifer Greene, thanks for the invitation but I’ll pass. 😉
So to me it would make more sense to arm the border patrol with unlimited resources of sophisticated anit-intrusion equipment.
Stephanie Wilson, exactly you used a fire arm, which solidifies my opinion.  Joyce Williams, the sweetness of owning a firearm.  Sheila Keller, until they dig a tunnel...  Chrstina Machmeyer, oh really you think so you’ve seen it yourself or did you read about it? 🤔
Arturo Elroy Mañana oops! Didn’t get my point again!🙄 What I’m saying is, if a wall and guards around your home and family is good enough for you, what about our country and citizens!
Tom Harver you need to take the blindfold off it’s a supply and demand issue, if Americans didn’t seek any of the things you mentioned we wouldn’t be talking about this right now. Common sense is, not always believing what you read.
Arturo Elroy Mañana you need some common Sense if we stop drugs and illegals from coming into America crime will go down. Fact is real border security and wall where needed would pay for itself in 2?years! If you are capable these facts are easy to find.

Mr. Evens even though it may look like I’m implying that illegals should be shot, I’m not. I’m just saying that there is different avenues against illegal entry verses a wall that might not even be effective hence “tunnels”.   Ed shaeffer, Leave me tell you, I do and it’s not because I only fear “illegals”.  Deb , agreed but what if they build tunnels what then?
Arturo I appreciate and respect your opinion but please think about border patrol agents at that border with no protection against hundreds of people rushing to cross! It is impossible and dangerous to not have any barrier or protection for them. You NEED some sort of deterrent and protection for those on the job
Arturo Elroy Mañana : Leave me ask you a question.  Do you lock your doors at night?
Arturo Elroy Mañana And you think shooting women and children (and men too) is a better way to stop the illegal crossings would be better than a wall? Maybe you should rethink that.
Pat Shaw, pretty sure not only to keep illegals out.
Good thing our front line border agents aren’t as dumb as you.
Pat Shaw and why do you think it didn’t get done then?  I’m willing to bet they didn’t go with it because they figured it wouldn’t work.   The sad thing is that by trump shutting down the government it really doesn’t solve anything. The only ppl that are affected are the government employees  and not the “illegals”.
Arturo Elroy Mañana Well, I remember when Clinton in fact both thought the wall and a stricter border control to keep out unwanted illegals.  I saw Obama say the same thing regarding our need for a wall and we had to curtail the influx of illegals. Now, we have someone willing and ready to get the job done but? What happened? The wall is still needed for the same reasons as Democrats wanted then, what’s changed with it being effective? Nothing!!! Except Trump is pushing for it and unless Pelosi gets her head out of her ass, it’s going to be a really tough time for a lot of federal workers! But hey, she can take another vacation she has no worries, right!! Nothing like working for your citizens that support you 🤔
Arturo Elroy Mañana the wall will work
Arturo Elroy Mañana good point but it would be alot harder if they had to scale over a steel slated barrier..
Arturo Elroy Mañana mhttp://dlvr.it/Qx3hxn
Pat Shaw, yes drugs that Americans consume and illegals that get hired by American businesses. One more thing I’m def not against helping border patrol, I’m just saying they would probably get more benefit from better technology than a wall that would probably be jumped over or dug under... Maybe you ought to click on Larry Mitchell’s link... You’re obviously not doing your research and looking at this situation from trumps point of view and not the agents...
Arturo Elroy Mañana lmao stop drugs and illegals is a supply and demand issue?? This is now just ridiculous! You obviously have a invested interest in not wanting this wall to help our border agents!!😳
Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.

Mellissa why do you pucker your mouth like that in all your photos? Just eat a lemon? From the info on your Facebook profile it appears you have a lot of personal house cleaning to do before you come on Facebook to solve America's border issues. Also, lose the arrogance. You have done nothing to earn it, "baby"
“Perfectly normal?” It’s perfectly insane for witnesses in or subjects of a criminal investigation to be discussing testimony.--Giuliani tells Tapper, “As far as I know, President Trump did not have discussions with [Cohen], certainly had no discussions with him in which he told him or counseled him to lie.” Then says it’s possible Trump discussed his testimony with him, “which would be perfectly normal.”
That's all that's Important we keep fighting
Thank you MaryAnn for sharing your thoughts and encouraging others ❤❤❤❤Prayers for you and  for all the victims families ..agree so important to keep fighting .. Stay strong!

My heart and prayers go out to all the victims! And if you think about it ,aren't all legal hard working Americans victims? They come here and abuse our law and order, our resources , our job opportunities, our taxes that should be used to benefit Americans who are struggling! They broke our laws and we are paying the price.  Build that wall!

Erin Curry Bayhan  You mean when Trump does the right thing. He shut the government down. By the way how many weeks have you gone without pay? The creditors don’t say oh pay us when you can. I can see why you support Trump & the Republican Party as you lack empathy & any understanding of what these 800,000 families are going through.

No chance to work this mess out because she doesn’t care about anything other than getting her way! She has some grandiose idea she’s in charge 😂😂 She is the culprit in this shutdown and she is the solution!! Trump has tried to make compromises and she is blocking everything, nothing more than a careless stubborn bitch!😡

Erin Curry Bayhan he will get paid, but when I put gas in car, buy groceries, pay my mortgage, electric etc they aren’t going to take an IOU. Fortunately we have savings for now, but there are many couples that work at the prison and single parents who need their paycheck. I’m over both sides and the blame game, I just want this to all end. It is a sad day in our country for sure.

If schools would actually do something about the bullies in their schools, we wouldn't have half the shootings we do now. The schools claim to have zero tolerance, but when you actually report it, they claim that kids will be kids. So you want safety inside, then they need to fix their bullying policies, and start expelling all kids that have been know to bully others. This is the schools problem to fix, not Trumps.

Both chuck and Nancy voted for over 350mi of wall under Obama, the only reason why they didn't take a deal for daca is because they are trying to save face and be "team players".  If Obama was still pres and asking for less then 260mi of wall... Well we already saw how they cast their vote.  All these leftists who think chuck and Nancy are playing for then are dense idiots.

Shirley Terry Harrow really, what about about the other 99.54% of the murders committed in this country by US citizens. Any thoughts and prayers on those. Anytime someone is murdered is tragic to say that Nancy Pelosi doesn't feel empathy for the family and friends who have lost some one to these violent act suggest that you yourself lack empathy, I hope not. Unfortunately we are seen as one of the most violent countries in the world. Praying that you find the love of Jesus in your soul once again.

Shirley Terry Harrow   Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens.

Bill Harris I'm pretty sure both parties have been screwed up in many different ways over time. The Republicans are the mess right now. The Trumpers/Tea party have driven away Republicans in droves. So much that people I never thought would vote democrat are switching parties. Trump is the biggest mistake they ever made.

Rudy Giuliani tells Chuck Todd on 'Meet the Press' that President Trump 'can remember having conversations' with Michael Cohen about Trump Tower Moscow right up until the election—as late as November of 2016----If Trump Tower Moscow negotiations continued to Nov., statements candidate Trump made in late July (where he used the present tense) were lies:  “I have nothing to do with Russia. I don’t have any jobs in Russia. I’m all over the world but we’re not involved in Russia.”

Hazel Ramey how's that working out for you? 🤣Republicans investigated Hillary for 4 years and $250 million and came up with nothing. Comey and Rosenstein are Trump appointees just like Cohen (guilty on 8 felony counts) and Manfort (guilty on 8 felony counts). Steele is a former MI6 agent, (British intelligence for you ignorant Trumpanzees). Clinton was already impeached for lying to congress as he should have been. So when does Trump get impeached for lying to congress and everybody else on a daily basis?

My guess is he is mad the Dems took the house and scared to death of what Mueller has on him as he watches all of his associates go to prison. This is his big distraction and its failing BIGLY.

Mike J Knifong this is not a lie and believing anything snopes says is a joke. Snopes is notorious for its lies. They are a liberal site and will always call truth lies  When the owner was asked how they get their information he could not answer. That money was not Iran's. That money was given back to them as ransom when Iran held American's hostage for 444 days. Carter released that money in the final hours of his administration.  Fact. Snopes is a joke and couldn't tell the truth if their life depended on it. Obummer used taxpayer dollars to give to a terrorist nation that hates America.  He did it without congressional approval in the dead of night and with pallets of cash.

Im fine with Trump's proposal of temporary protection  for DREAMers for 3 years in exchange for the wall, if the wall also is only protected for 3 years.  After 3 years we can tear what's been built down.  I mean it's not money out of our pocket, right?  Mexico is paying!

Yanira Blanco what have any of the four people you mentioned done to deserve prison time? The last time I checked a bunch of Trumps people were going to prison including his personal lawyer, campaign manager and national security advisor. Trump is under 17 investigations. But yes, lets put the elderly billionaire George Soros in jail- who by the way is a super generous billionaire that actually gives his money to charity unlike Trump who ran a fraudulent foundation.  What is your obsession with Soros anyway? I think you might be watching too much right wing propaganda.

Ronald Bettney  Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S.

it's the demo RATS fault at this that these people are not getting paid (but eventually will get paid), dems are stupid and ignorant, we need this wall, walls work, they work in all the other countries that WE actually paid for!  I know these demo RATS got ants in their pants, but they need to let go now and work w/ our president and get this wall up now.  no more pussy footing around here you dems, you need to wise up and see what you dems are doing to this country, you are all (demo RATS) destroying our country by letting illegals thru our border and eating up our money and OUR PEOPLE are the ones that are hurting and suffering, doesn't Pelosi know many of these illegals have killed our people?  what is wrong with her?  OH, yes, she has dementia or much more a mental problem and does not know what she is doing.  what would she do if an illegal killed one of her kids (if she has any) or grandchildren or a loved one?  I guess she would just ignore it, thats her.

Dave Mosley Jr.  The dynamics of that changed when Democrats refuse to negotiate anything. Congress has one main job. Pass a budget. That hasn’t been done in decades. No business can operate without a budget.   Who has gone on vacations during the shutdown. Democrats. Who was planning on another trip with friends and family during the shutdown? Nancy. Who was planning on being out of the country and not being there to negotiate? Nancy. Who was going to be gone when yet another payroll period ended on Tuesday for the workers she claimed to care about? Nancy. Who lied about concerns for security for the SOTU address without asking Secret Service or Homeland Security first? Nancy. Who HID from Angel Families who were right outside her office? Nancy.  Who got her plane snatched out from under her? Nancy.

Randall Nadeau Ryan Clunes is not delusional honey you are. All Ryan did was actually read Trump's history.

Cindy Cripps-Prawak I think you meant to say Pelosi/Schumer instead of President Trump. What you mentioned is exactly what they're doing. The dems don't care thing one about us. We are beyond disposable to them. The more of us who have our lives taken by illegals the more of those same illegals can come here. Its a win/win for them. Sadly Cindy...people like you won't get it until one of your loved ones is murdered by an illegal. No doubt if the dems get their way you won't have long to wait for that to happen.

First one is good but that second one needs work or at the very least I have found that the majority of reader should at least consider finishing the book. it has 2 parts and some of these folks seem focused on the first one like they have never even read the second half.

Cindy Cripps-Prawak   What's mean spirited is the fact that democrats care more about the illegals than they do the voters that elected them.  Why do Democrats support and defend illegal immigration, even declaring "sanctuary cities and States", and also resist voter ID?  How does supporting illegal immigration and fraudulent voting benefit the average US citizen? Any citizen?  How could anyone vote for any Democrat and think themselves a patriot?

Democrats need to wake up!  I don't think their images of going to Hawaii, or Puerto Rico and having a grand time while government personnel aren't working/getting paid look too good.  Also saying that you don't like Trump's last offer before it was offered and gave you 4 out of 5 things you wanted looks good either.  Americans are smarter than you think; they know who is keeping the government shut down.  OPTICS, people!

Cindy Cripps-Prawak it seems that Trump is the only one trying to open the government. He went from a wall to fence sections and offered everything that the Dems wanted. Security on the southern border is a real concern and must be fixed. But liberals like illegals voting for them
so screw the 99.5% of all working americans????   those govt employees will get back pay - but how bout all the murdered victims? their families? the drug runners gang members conming across the border?  OPEN YOUR EYES

They are just saving face and playing for their team which apparently daca is not part of. Way to stab yourselves in the back idiots.

Nick Nevels the "now" is that illegal immigrants are a problem that needs to be solved.  It's been brought up many times by many past presidents and then ignored.  This President promised to deal with the problem and is trying to do what he promised.  Elected Democrats are doing everything they can to oppose him at every turn.  They think if this lasts long enough that people who once supported Trump will get frustrated and won't support him in the next election.  Plain and simple.

Cindy Cripps-Prawak   Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S.

He is not just ignorant--which could be the case for a smart person or one of average intelligence who was just too lazy to learn.  He is not just allergic to facts because they tend to undermine his worldview and reveal his cons and his crimes. He is actually a full-fledged nitwit who is as unfamiliar with logic, sound reasoning, true insight, a sense of consequences, the relevance of context, as he is with ethics, or values or taste.  Yes, he is a traitor and a criminal and a vile hateful person. But we must always remember that which he reminds of every time he opens his mouth or Tweets his Tweets.  He is dope, a maroon, a useful idiot to some and a dangerous idiot when it comes to all the rest of us.  He is a dim bulb who has left us all stumbling around in is darkness. Time to flip on the lights America and see this guy for who he is and for what he is not.  Later we can determine the role dementia or drugs or lack of education or arrogance or just bad genes played in the creation of this pinheaded ninny of a cretinous nincompoop. But for now, as you weigh our circumstances and likely outcomes, always remember, it is not just bad character or greed or evil at work here...though they too are all present.  It is that our president is also just plain dumb.

Paul Pietrantonio Republican Congressman whose district includes several hundred mile of th eborder explains why the wall's misguidedness   https://www.businessinsider.com/will-hurd-border-security-idea-fiber-optic-cable-instead-of-wall-2019-1
Paul Pietrantonio gimme a break.  He's a lying charlatan and you're defending him.
THIS is a key point not enough people have been making.   Under questioning Trump *actively hid from U.S. intelligence what he'd been doing*. And if Flynn knew any of what Trump was doing, so did he, as he was in the classified briefing with Trump on August 17, 2016.  And didn’t report either the deal or the contacts as the FBI requested in their security briefing, and lied about both  In that briefing, U.S. intel was *also* informing Trump that the Russians were going to try to infiltrate his campaign to influence him. It's evident that those statements (plus questions) were intended to provoke disclosures from Trump about whether any such effort had begun. Beyond having spoken to the briefers, Mueller would know from Flynn exactly what Trump said during that meeting, in other words how many lies he told to law enforcement bout his contacts with the Kremlin. And those lies, told during a criminal investigation, would be *crimes*.  That's why I have Making False Statements on the list of "collusive crimes" (in this particular fact-pattern, i.e. the Trump-Russia investigation). Because that's almost certainly what Trump did on August 17, 2016 and Mueller would have multiple witnesses to confirm it by now.
Todd Cuson, eventually with the help of GOD you will find that even when you disagree with someone that it's always better to use actual facts when making arguments!!PEACE

Paul Pietrantonio Truth
Harold Kupers, it's not all about me it's what he is doing for this country, besides what he has done for me!! This country has a booming economy and when I ran a corporation in NYC I always said we needed a businessman to remove all the crippling regulations and high taxes to allow businesses to grow and hire more people,  he is bringing respect back to our military and police officers who sacrifice their lives to provide our security!! Our Country is a safer and more economically capable of bringing the American dream to all those who seek it legally!!
Paul Pietrantonio you love him for what? What has he done? What good work has he done or will do? Pleas educate me.
Britney Joray, and it's all because the Democrats don't want President Trump to be President because they Hate Him, They Hate the American People who elected him and they Hate America!! We still have a loving God who could still save them if they want it!!

DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old. Here are 30 ways Americans are feeling the pain:  1. 450,000 public workers are being made to work without pay, including members of the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, Border Patrol, FBI, and Secret Service. 2. 350,000 public workers have been temporarily laid off. 3. Tens of thousands of federal contractors have been laid off for a month, including janitors, security guards, and cafeteria workers. They are losing up to $200 million a day. It is unlikely that they will ever receive pay for the time they have missed. 4. Nearly 10,000 companies that do business with the U.S. government are losing money, according to the Washington Post. 5. Pop-up food banks have opened up to feed unpaid government workers. 6. The four week shutdown is costing the U.S. $200 million a day, or almost $6 billion so far according to analysis by The New York Times. 7. Unpaid TSA workers have been calling in 'sick' or quitting, leading to longer security lines and missed flights. Some airports have begun closing terminals. 8. The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9. Air Traffic Controllers, who were already suffering a 30-year staffing low, have been feeling the strain of going unpaid. Some have begun quitting. 10. With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21. The FTC's identity theft reporting system is shut down. 22. Student loans are being delayed as universities are unable to verify parents' income with the IRS 23. Small Business Administration loans have been delayed. 24. Domestic violence shelters that receive federal funds have been forced to cut services. 25. Highway and transit projects are being delayed or canceled. 26. Wildfire preparations in western states are delayed. 27. The National Hurricane Center's research has been delayed 28. The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo are closed. 29. Funding for Section 8 housing assistance has lapsed, placing low-income families at risk of eviction. 30. Civil cases in federal court have been delayed. Lawsuits against Donald Trump in federal court are on hold.
Paul Pietrantonio fixing the problem would be devoting resources to legal and safe paths to legal immigration and legal and safe asylum application. The only reason to deny these is to keep America white.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/two-charts-demolish-the-notion-that-immigrants-here-illegally-commit-more-crime/
Paul Pietrantonio On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan, told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
1) They won't be sending quite as much money back home. 2) We won't be educating their children. 3) We won't be spending as much on Illegals health care. 4) Less Welfare and Food Stamps. 5) Fewer Criminal Illegals in our jails. Yep! Mexico will be responsible for all this. Hmmm,still think Mexico isn't paying for that wall?

He offers them everything they want but they still....after the government being shut down all this time......refuse to compromise in any way. How can this situation we are in be viewed as anything other than Nancy's fault. Pathetic!!

Roy Meston because it causes a domino effect of wage increases, also, it puts many small businesses out of business, as they often don't have much of a profit margin, their only option is to lay off workers, or incorporate jobs, which would prevent them hiring in many cases, the economy would start to tank within a short time, federal employees would probably be the first to lose their jobs, budgets would not be able to cope with such an increase!

Gary Kane, so you are pro drug smuggler and pro human traffickers and you like our tax money going to support illegals. What exactly do you have against LEGAL immigration and border security?

Roy Meston do have you thought that thru do you think that the businesses are going to loose money every thing WILL go cost of living will go up which will still put the ones that it is design to help in the same place that their in now it will put them in different tax bracket which means more taxes paid. I know because I'm one of the ones mostly have worked for minimum wages for 40 years when min wages were 4.30 hr to current of 12.00 the sad thing is by the time taxes are taken I still make about the same as I did some 40 years ago may 20 dollars more a week due to taxes that is a way to get more taxes

States will never be unified when we are talking about two different parties, but what we are talking about is common sense, the barrier needs built and laws changed. Not because they don't like this president.

Mexico that's the answer. We'll teach you how to ride the range and mend fences that the illegals demolish. We'll teach you to shoot firearms to defend yourself. We'll teach you to bar the doors and windows from theft and vandalism. Most of all you ignorant moron, we'll teach you HOW TO PULL YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR DUMBSHIT ASS SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

Roy Meston have you tried building a wall? Because I can tell you that it may not stop it ALL but it will slow it down. We waste billions over dollars every year, but now we are unwilling to waste billions on ACTUAL Americans for a chance to save not only our lives but the lives of women and children who are ASSAULTED when attempting to come to America? I'm the kind of person who looks at my glass half full, you must be a half empty kind of dude.

Larry Mitchell when a person doesn't have a decent argument, they resort to name calling, just like a two year old. Grow up, quit spreading rumors. And if you want to bring up him supposedly Not knowing a single bible quote, maybe you should quit being a hypocrite. Here are a couple for you. "Judge not that us be not judged". Or how about "pull out the mote that is in your own eye, before you try to pull out the mote in your brothers eye". Better yet, just shut up!

Let’s just see you invite a dozen into your home.  You feed and clothe them. You pay there medical bills. Cause that is exactly where working Americans tax dollars are going.  We have enough hungry homeless people in our country that should come first js. Besides your democratics voted for a 50 billion wall before Trump became President don’t you even care what happened to that money don’t you wonder how Nancy and chuck became rich while serving our country and don’t you even wonder why they want so many illegals here they are allowing the law to be broken and doesn’t it bother you that they all have walls and fences around their homes for their safety. Truth is they use the illegals to get votes once they get illegal votes they don’t really care about them either. They only care about themselves and power. Wake up js

You liberals don’t listen to anyone who levels with you. All the border patrol including authorities from Obama Bin Laden’s administration are on Tucker, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham EVERY NIGHT telling you a wall is what they need; that in fact they can do their job if they had a wall. Further that you ignore the facts and listen to your socialists congress tells me you don’t want border security under ANY circumstances.  It suits you just fine that taxpayers are spending over a $billion dollars a year on these assholes.

Further that you ignore the facts and listen to your socialists congress tells me you don’t want border security under ANY circumstances.  It suits you just fine that taxpayers are spending over a $billion dollars a year on these assholes.
Trump, you and an immigrant are sitting at a table with 1000 cookies on. Trump takes 999, turns to you and says "Careful, that immigrant is after your cookie"

A conservative challenged liberal Facebook friends to “make a case, not based on emotion” against Trump’s wall. Conservative buddies flooded his post with snide remarks about how this would be impossible for “deluded libs.”  “Okay, I’ll play,” I responded. And in order to avoid being accused of bias, I explained that I would use only conservative sources to prove my point. My primary source was a policy paper by the Cato Institute, a conservative, rightwing think tank, along with other conservative voices (listed at the end of the piece). Here’s why I’m against the wall, I wrote:  1. Walls don’t work. Illegal immigrants have tunneled underneath and/or erected ramps up and down walls to simply drive over them. People find a way. When East Germany erected its wall, it created a military zone, staffed by booted, machine-gun carrying guards ready to shoot to kill. Yet thousands managed to make it to West Germany anyway. More to the point, do we really want to model ourselves after communist East Germany?  2. Most illegal immigrants are “overstayers.” They come to the US legally — for vacations, business, to study, etc. — and then STAY past their visas. By 2012, overstayers accounted for 58% (THE MAJORITY!) of all unauthorized immigrants. A wall is meaningless here!  3. Walls have little impact on drugs being brought in to the US. According to the DEA, almost all drugs come in through legal points of entry, hidden in secret containers and/or among legit goods in tractor-trailers. A wall will have little to no impact on the influx of drugs into our country.  4. It’s environmentally impractical. Walls have a hard time making it through extreme weather. For example, in 2011, a flood in Arizona washed away 40 feet of STEEL fencing. Torrential rains and raging waters do serious damage. Also, conservative sources generally do not address the environmental harm that walls create, but there is plenty of documentation available that show its potential for irreparable damage to both plant and animal life.  5. A wall would forces the U.S. government to take land from private citizens in eminent domain battles. Private citizens own much of the land slated for the wall. The costs of the government snatching private land — and the legal battles that would ensue — are incalculable.  6. Border patrol agents don’t like concrete or steel walls because they block surveillance capabilities. In other words, they can’t mobilize correctly to meet challenges. So in many ways, a wall makes their job more difficult.  7. Border patrol agents say, “Walls are meaningless without agents and technology to back them up.” Are we prepared to pour countless billions annually — after the wall is built — to create a nearly 2,000 mile, militarized 24-hour surveillance border operation? Because according to patrol agents, that’s the only way a wall would work. Again, are we really, going to use East Germany, a brutal communist state, as our model here?  8. Where walls have been built, there was “no discernable impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens.” In other words, they came in elsewhere, primarily where natural barriers such as water or mountainous regions precluded a wall.  9. An unintended consequence is that a wall blocks farmworkers from EXITING when their invaluable seasonal work is done. Farmers are against the wall because it makes getting cheap seasonal labor almost impossible as few American citizens want or can even do those jobs. And if seasonal worker do get in, a wall makes it harder for them to leave! A wall traps migrant farm laborers in our country.  10. Trump’s $5 billion is a laughable drop in the bucket for what would ACTUALLY be needed. For example, according to the Cato Institute: An estimate for a border wall area that only covered 700 miles was originally 1.2 billion. How much did it REALLY cost? SEVEN BILLION. And that’s only for 700 miles. Whatever we think it’s going to cost, experience shows us we have to multiply it by more than 500%.  11. According to MIT engineers, the wall would cost $31.2 billion. Homeland Security estimates it at $22 billion. Given the pattern of spending mentioned in number 10 (plus Murphy’s Law), that means we’re really talking about pouring endless billions into something that doesn’t even work. And, of course, we taxpayers will be footing the bill, not Mexico. Given all the drawbacks, is that REALLY the best use of our taxes?  As the conservatives of the Cato Institute put it, “President Trump’s wall would be a mammoth expenditure that would have little impact on illegal immigration.” (Emphasis mine) Also it would create many “direct harms:” “the spending, the taxes, the eminent domain abuse, and the decrease in immigrant’s freedoms of movement.”  And, we must add, since conservative sources do not — that the environmental harms are likely to be severe.  In other words, the facts show that walls don’t work and they create even bigger, more expensive problems.  So what happened after I posted this conservative-sourced, fact-based list of why the wall is a bad idea?  Silence.  I waited for someone to respond, to engage with me. Where were the angry defenses or rebuttals? But when I searched for the post after a few days, I couldn’t find it.  My FB friend had deleted it. You could say, like Trump with the government, he shut me down rather than deal with the facts.  The ugly genius of Trump is his ability to manipulate deep, primal emotions — namely fear and hate. He, along with Fox News, have convinced his base that they are in “extreme danger” from immigrants and only a wall will make them “safe.”  Unfortunately, the need to “feel” safe is much stronger than the will to grapple with a complex, multi-faceted problem.  And so, here we are, paralyzed by shutdowns at every turn.

Every single thing below is verifiable.   This is why he is desperate to get the $5.6 billion:  From Donna Chaban-Delmas:  "This evening I would like to share something I just read, not my words, but those of someone who does his or her research before posting. What you will read here is a matter of public record.   This week we share with you a name....Roman Abramovich. (google him, we can wait....) Mr. Abramovich, a Russian national with Israeli citizenship, is an ally of Russian president Putin, and a personal friend of Donald Trump and his son in law. Mr. Abramovich is part owner (with several other Russian billionaires) of a steel company called Evraz - located in Canada - which, coincidentally, is the only one which can manufacture the specific type of metal beams Mr. Trump wants for his wall. (There was a Chinese company which could deliver the same product, but since Mr. Trump's trade war with China, they can no longer effectively provide it to the US.)  If the wall is built, Mr. Abramovich's company - in which Russian president Putin also happens to own stock through a complicated series of shell companies - stands to make roughly one billion US dollars during the first stage of construction alone. By the time the wall is completed, with costs estimated to run to almost 30 billion dollars (not 5 billion as the Republican parrots have been squawking), Evraz will likely triple in value.  This is of interest to Mr. Abramovich and his partners no doubt, since Evraz took a signifcant stock hit in early 2016, losing roughly 60% of its value....during the months leading up to the American Presidential Election.  Mr. Abramovich also owns a legendary yacht called the Eclipse, valued at roughly half a billion dollars.  Mr. Trump has been known to enjoy vacations on the yacht. One can safely assume the yacht has beautiful staterooms, with beds.  And showers.  And likely, given Mr. Abramovich's well-reported paranoia, there are plenty of security cameras in place....  Mr. Abramovich applied for Swiss residency some time ago, but was blocked by their government because of tangible evidence that he was involved in money laundering.  This is all public record. And it was presented to the media during the 2016 Election, when the press was slavering over Mrs. Clinton's emails and calling her "Killery".  But nobody listened."

Gary Kane ok, so how many are you willing to house?
Roy Meston If you thought that then you have not been listening at all.."Our proposal is not intended to solve all of our immigration challenges. This plan solves the immediate crisis -- and it is a horrible crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis like we rarely see in our country. And it provides humanitarian relief, delivers real border security, and immediately reopens our federal government. If we are successful in this effort, then we can start the border [broader] project of remaking our immigration system for the 21st century. Once the government is open and we have made a down payment on border security, and immigration reform starts to happen, I plan to convene weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House so we can do a finished product, a great product -- a product that we can all be proud of, having to do with that elusive immigration problem."

You do know nobody climbs a fence carrying a ton of cocaine right?
How does a wall slow down a Criminal Cartel with Planes exactly?
Gary Kane shut up dumb ass
I swear for the ones that don't want this country to be better secured & wants to allow it to get worse why don't u go live with them in Mexico if you like that kind of life so much.   And for the idiots that keep sayin the wall isn't gona keep them out blah blah blah. We know it won't keep them all out but we need something to slow them down where they can be stopped. It takes a lot of man power to guard & stop them when there's so much of the border that's absolutely nothing there. It would be like locking the doors on your house. It'll keep more from breaking in so easy but won't stop them all. But you leave your house everyday with your doors unlocked & see how many times your house is invaded.

It'll keep more from breaking in so easy but won't stop them all. But you leave your house everyday with your doors unlocked & see how many times your house is invaded.

Gary Kane seriously Gary, if you believe this you are then part of the problem. It’s time to pull your head out of the sand and see it for what it really is build the wall.
Gary Kane  Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S. Constituents, if you ‘like’ this, like it whenever you see it.   https://m.facebook.com/The-Great-1461-Day-Adventure-360025854356893/

Stan Piznarski, Amy Klobuchar will probably run for the Dems in 2020. She could be a very tough opponent.
John Wheeler  Well John, the answer is simple. Nancy and Chuck can allow $5.7 billion for our security wall, which is peanuts, and everybody immediately goes back to work.  Or....the Democrats continue to allow open borders in order to harvest votes from hundreds of thousands, even millions eventually, of illegal non citizens from several South American countries. This practice was unheard of and a crime around 10 years ago.

Stan Piznarski President Trump will be reelected unless the Democrats are able to keep bringing in hundreds of thousands of illegals for their illegal votes. Yeah, that's a pretty scary scenario!

Stan Piznarski 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
You obviously don't have a mind of your own.
Stan Piznarski he is a terrible deal maker, it’s all a fraud!  More importantly he is either going to back down on China or eclair he made a deal, but it will be a deal that weakens America.  I don’t ask you agree, I understand your support and I support you as an American.  Please scrutinize whatever deal he makes with China though, don’t just believe “it’s great” because he says so.  The future of America relies on it.
Chris Jordan G  "Dictate what he wants," Chris! He wants a wall! WE WANT A SECURITY WALL!!! His main campaign promise was that he would build a wall for border security, and he is trying to fulfill that campaign promise to the voters that won his election.

Jerry Wilcox 60% plus Americans don’t want a wall from sea to shining sea!  What the mojority of Americans want is secure borders! We want modern technology, the same technology that the criminals are using! If we dont step up to the plate and modernize how we secure our borders the drug cartels and the few illegals that try will breach the outdated wall. Please remember walls can be tunneled under, climbed over and in some cases through the walls themselves! Let’s use our heads please!

Imagine, 4 years ago the thought of building a wall along the southern border never entered your minds. Now it is all you talk and think about. Why? Could it be your thought process is being manipulated? You will say no, but think long and hard about why this has become a point of contention. If this can be made something you argue about with anyone who disagrees, what else have you been duped into believing? Think about it. Project MKUltra

"Followers" who can't wipe their own ass and who are waiting on Donald Trump to tell them when to jump and how high voted for this terrorist because they can't think for themselves.  DONALD TRUMP is a TERRORIST: a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

Stan Piznarski Trump has pissed both sides off with his latest proposals. The right hate the fact he is talking about amnesty for the Dreamers. The left say it’s a nonstarter with Trump holding the government workers hostage.   His approval rating is now under 40%, a death sign for all Republican office holders. Not a good time to have a last name ending in Trump or being part of the Trump led cult.   The Trump bandwagon broke down many miles ago. It is sitting on the side of the road with broken wheels and flies buzzing all around. The buzzards are circling overhead, they are attracted by the smell political rot.

FACT!   Now he says hill give the same thing he took away, 2 yrs ago, DACA & TPS  offering temporary protection from deportations for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall funding for 5.7, for his NONE WALL he promised Mexico would pay for...lol ( not a compromise ) and makes up a crises, Majority of drugs come at ports of entry FACT!

John Wheeler But trying to reopen the Government is,  but looks to be an impossible task with half of the lawmakers refusing to talk and as usual showing that the American people are not their main concern,  they say how bad they feel for all those people who , and with the next breath they show them that they still care more about those new voters that they need to get into the Country. In the end those eight hundred thousand furloughed workers their  families and friends will decide who to hold responsible for this shutdown. I doubt they are all sitting around the kitchen table cheering the fact the the Democrats refuse to even discuss any kind of compromise,  they can plainly see that the President is trying, can’t imagine that they are sending messages to Pelosi letting her know that it’s ok hold your ground, it’s ok the kids ate yesterday, they will make it for a couple of more days, the electric company probably won’t turn off the power during the coldest weather we have had so far,  our neighborhood brought a couple of gallons of gas for the car just Incase we have an emergency. So yes Nancy stay strong take care of your special projects , get your votes , the American people are have had years of The Democrats putting them last so carry on.

Judy Bennett Solverson, I wasn't talking about past Presidents, I was talking about you and the "belivers" in Trump. Think back to when you thought for yourself. Did you think there was a national emergency on the border 4 years ago? Now, think about the rest of what you belive currently. You and many like you are being manipulated.

Stan Piznarski  Representatives, please put US citizen’s rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it’s more efficient, and they don’t throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities’ computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S. Constituents, if you ‘like’ this, like it whenever you see it.   https://m.facebook.com/The-Great-1461-Day-Adventure-360025854356893/

1) They won't be sending quite as much money back home. 2) We won't be educating their children. 3) We won't be spending as much on Illegals health care. 4) Less Welfare and Food Stamps. 5) Fewer Criminal Illegals in our jails. Yep! Mexico will be responsible for all this. Hmmm,still think Mexico isn't paying for that wall?

President Trump made 8,158 false or misleading claims in his first two years -- Put another way: The president averaged nearly 5.9 false or misleading claims a day in his first year in office. But he hit nearly 16.5 a day in his second year, almost triple the pace.

Stan Piznarski Maybe the President with the help of Congress can designate an easement of the much of the border as one long protected National Park or Monument and then legally use funds to protect the vegetation of the parks with a wall, due to ecological impacts from Illegal immigrants destroying the protected lands. An existing example of something similar to this would be the Roosevelt Reservation.

Yadira why so many lies wann be white Latina?
Robin Barnhill, were those that destroyed Ferguson and other cities out in public?     Are you referring to the racists that were smashing windows, looting, burning buildings, flipping cars, injuring innocent people, throwing rocks and the like, which destroyed at least 3 inner cities? Is it those people you’re referring to?
Chris Jordan G, Obama had the same plan, with the same technology only 6 years ago. And it passed through Congress with only 19 nays. So apparently Democrats were in favor as well.
Yadira Bornacelli, so if I think differently than you, I'm a Liberal, or if I'm not a follower of Trump, I'm liberal. Is it either your way or nothing at all? Until the mid election didn't the Republicans have control. Your semantics lack genuine truth and reasoning.
Gary Williams the Liberals have had freedom to think differently for too long and it's becoming the destruction of our country so now you're seeing conservatives fed up and taking control back
Yadira Bornacelli, aren't you being exclusively discrimnatory?  What is an American? And so if I don't agree with Trump I'm not an American or I'm actually a communist? So we all must think like you and believe what you believe, or else?

Stan Piznarski, not every American loves Trump and I believe that there are more who dislike him. Trump doesn't care about building America, all he wants to do is build a wall. In the meantime my nighborhood is being ransacked by dangerous criminals who are actually legal American citizens. None of us are really safe and especially our schools. Our factories are not coming(roaring)back, many have moved to Mexico. Imagine that! No, not every American loves Trump and he is the one who is impossible, especially his promises which he cannot keep.

Stan Piznarski wake up! You are a joke
If THAT WAS TRue, Why didn’t you promise to make lying, bearing false witness, and evil propaganda illegal and unlawful.  Especially when it comes to lying to masses. That’s should be a capital offense.

Stan Piznarski On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace...

He asked for $1.6 billion, appropriations committee said "OK", then he said nevermind make it $5 billion, House said "OK", then he said actually $5.7 billion PLUS let's shutdown the government, and he struck no deals until the opposing party took the House away January 3. YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH LIARS.  So forget Donald, he is just fooling around. He's changed the terms before and he'll do it again, so just bypass him with a veto-proof majority.  Why? Because air traffic controllers. Because ICE. Because US Coast Guard. Because TSA. Because America is open for business, even if president bone spur isn't.  Veto-proof majority, just bypass the useless lying cheating bone spur.

For trump to use those refugees to frighten Americans is absolutely scandalous. Shame on trump for doing it, shame on his followers who are buying it.
Angela Wilson you do not know European socialism, the Americans. It's not diabolical, it's just thinking about people in need, it's solidarity above all else. You have a false idea of ​​socialism. In France and Europe we are losing more and more and we have to fight in the street against excessive capitalism. Excusez mon anglais 😁

William Bush yes, exactly. Especially when the powers that be hated him so much. Why? Why would they suddenly hate someone whom they loved? That makes me suspicious. It makes me wonder what they are so afraid of? I've never seen a president more slandered than Trump.

The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
