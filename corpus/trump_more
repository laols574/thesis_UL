Joe Guy ok smart ass
Joe Guy well it's hard for him to keep his word when the Democrats keep hindering everything he does.
Joe Guy I call bullshit on what u said it's TRUE u just have to see through it all the liberal B.S
Prisons already have walls. Put trump behind one
Joe Guy That's why I support Trump he is not a politician

Ry Burzynski but it's ok to send 10.6 billion dollars to Central America and south Mexico ? Where the democrats logic behind that ? I'd love to hear it...and since someone bound to ask "when did that happen?" , It was Dec.18 2018...

Moni Brooks Pay die it Low Minded Trumpee  Go
You are an idiot!  Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall, not the US taxpayer. TSA workers who aren‚Äôt getting paid are starting not to show up, putting our aviation industry in danger. The workers need to feed their families. Trump said ‚ÄúI can relate to federal workers not getting paid‚Äù. Ha! This from a guy who inherited millions of dollars from his dad. Tell that to the CBP officer who can‚Äôt pay rent. Trump has never had to pay rent or make a car payment. Those USSS agents that guard Trump and put their lives on the line everyday are working for free as is the Coast Guard and more! Trump could care less! This is a crisis caused by the liar in the WH.
Chris George keep laughing! Sense of humor is good! You're going to need that sense of humor in the days to come. In fact, it will be your only comfort. Keep smiling!
Chris George we lose because you post something from Wikipedia LOL  Go have your milk and cookies and go to bed. Just go night night.
How many LIES will President Hoax be delivering in his FARCE delivered tonight from the headquarters of CENTRAL FAKE NEWS AGENCY operated out of the Oval Office???
Amy Johnson I guess the Democrats need to approve the funding then, since they care so much about the Americans.
Moni Brooks More than TWENTY-FIVE TIMES, President Donald J. Trump demanded a government shutdown in an attempt to force the American people to fund an expensive, ineffective border wall he promised Mexico would pay for. #TrumpShutdown
Moni Brooks No wall
Mark Kroeckel they're still choking on his success and they will continue to choke on his success because nothing they can say or do will erase the legacy of Barack Hussein Obama the best American president that we have ever had. And what happened in the Supreme Court today is going to seal Donald Trump's fate. #moneytrail #neverlies  https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rules-against-mystery-corporation-from-country-a-fighting-subpoena-in-mueller-investigation/2019/01/08/a39b61ac-0d1a-11e9-84fc-d58c33d6c8c7_story.html

Ellis Island didn't require a wall but millions of LEGAL immigrants came to the United States through it. LEGAL being the keyword.
Why?
Jamie Bennett So we can stop people who hate us from walking in, after that we can figure out what to do with the people that hate us who are already here .
Why?
Good your not from America because he don't want you here.
Paul Dahm no need to be an AH fella...
Trump. Just because you were able to ask your parents for money or have the Saudi Government bail you out of your bankruptcies do most hardworking Americans have that luxury. They were not born with a silver spoon in their mouth....

Jim Borecky
yes Ricky Wallace. We all want immigrants, but we want them to come in property and go through the proper channels. There‚Äôs a reason immigrants sneak into America illegally. It‚Äôs because they are criminals or they only want to abuse our Federal Welfare program. Legitimate immigrants will go through the proper process and become very welcome American citizens.

Elisa Farina DiCarlo üí©
Joanne Christie üí©
You are right, but darkness does not like the way President Trump's light shines.
Candy Jeffers thank you
Albert Kojo Kyekye STFU and stop kissing ass the wall is meant to keep Africans out as well you don't get a pass for kissing ass
It is meant to keep all illegals out, come in the right way, their are laws in place, look up illegal, if you don't know the difference.
Albert Kojo Kyekye  You are not alone. Many people from other countries like Trump; North Koreans, Saudi‚Äôs and Russians-just to mention a few
Karen Cadden All LIES!!
Dolly Paez maybe you need to check your sources to what you're reading.
Joanne Christie, i know for a fact when i have watched the president give a speach, and the next day cnn turns around what he says, to be a bought off democratic network. Use your eyes and ears, not some b.s. facts check the democrats have put in place...
Susan Stalla Sure he would if he did followed the proper immigration procedures. #justcantbustin
DiCarlo apparently neither do you!
Albert Kojo Kyekye He's a joke
I think each country needs a president like mr. Trump !!
Ilene R Mindlin Dementia,  like what all the Congress people have who voted to fund border security and a wall just a couple of years ago?  That kind of Dementia?
Elisa Farina DiCarlo  neither do you so shut up.

John Baron absolutely. He said he could feel for them üòÇüòÇüòÇ. He never had to work I mean real work In His life , so how could he feel for them. He was a millionaire by age 8 thanks to his corrupt daddy. The whole family was and is corrupt.
My message to Donald Trump :   ‚ÄúSure, border security !!! But that does not necessarily mean a 5 billion dollar wall !!! The Democrats also want border security ... but not the 5 billion dollar wall that you are proposing for border security !!! You need to learn how to negotiate and compromise !!! You are used to bullying until you get your own way !!! You have no respect or consideration for the other people with whom you are negotiating !!! You are 71 but you act like a child who hasn‚Äôt learned that he cannot always have his own way !!! You need to grow up !!! I hope the Democrats don‚Äôt let you get away with your bullying ways so that you may learn how to be a mature individual !!! Otherwise you need to be removed from circulation because people like you are a menace and not worthy of living in society with other people ...‚Äù
Elisa Farina DiCarlo ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on here‚Äù is that we have a sitting President who actually CARES about OUR country. I don‚Äôt know who you are or where you came from, but if you don‚Äôt like the upturns we have had, then you are more than welcome and free to leave. I‚Äôm sick to death of liberal BS, and those who ‚Äúthink‚Äù they are the future of the USA. This mentality is what is killing it to begin with. Just go.
Leigh Miller well said, its truly a shame that so many chose to allow sloppy media to interfere with common sense and independent thought.

Albert Kojo Kyekye For 5,6 Bn you could built 10 big factories and give work to thousands of Americans AND Immigrants.   There is no CRISIS at the boarder  A Crisis is what he is telling about IS beaten....
Albert Kojo Kyekye thank you though you should not waste your time. There are too many bigots that are so simple minded that they cannot even recognize their own bigotry. In our country, we have become too soft, so there is a lot more disrespect for ones self and for others then the rest of the world believes. The worst part is their hubris prevents them from seeing it and/or admitting it. I wish both the liberals and conservatives would see that their beat interest is to genuinely work in our best intereat, and not for some stupid agenda or for money or corporate power. Its sad. But that is the country we of the U.S. live in today. Welcome to Corporate America!

Why do you think he is the best
You are a fool and danger to our democracy!  Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall, not the US taxpayer. TSA workers who aren‚Äôt getting paid are starting not to show up, putting our aviation industry in danger. The workers need to feed their families. Trump said ‚ÄúI can relate to federal workers not getting paid‚Äù. Lol! This from a guy who inherited millions of dollars from his dad. Tell that to the CBP officer who can‚Äôt pay rent. Trump has never had to pay rent or make a car payment. Those USSS agents that guard Trump and put their lives on the line everyday are working for free as is the Coast Guard and more! Trump could care less! This is a crisis caused by the liar in the WH and a GOP that is spineless.

Lillian Weisberg Conway: Sarah Sanders made 'unfortunate misstatement' about terror suspects at border  ÔøºBY BRETT SAMUELSTWEET SHARE EMAIL  White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday downplayed the Trump administration's misrepresentation of the number of suspected terrorists apprehended at the southern border, arguing press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made "an unfortunate misstatement" a day earlier. Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked Conway if the White House's inability to get its facts right on immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border hurts its credibility after Sanders said on "Fox News Sunday" that "nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border." Anchor Chris Wallace challenged Sanders on her comments, noting that the State Department had said there haven't been any terrorists found coming across the border and that most were captured at airports. Conway on Monday acknowledged that most of the nearly 4,000 terrorists apprehended in fiscal 2017 were found at airports, citing a report from the Department of Homeland Security.  "It got unfortunately conflated by a colleague," she said. Ingraham went on to criticize the media for "cherry-picking" statistics and argued that "we all kind of make mistakes." "That was an unfortunate misstatement and everybody makes mistakes, all of us," Conway said. "The fact is, it's corrected here and anybody who turns a blind eye to the actual numbers of human trafficking, the increase in the drugs, we are concerned about your children here in the United States not being subject to all these drugs and we're concerned about their children."  Trump administration officials, including the president and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, have in recent months stated that thousands of terrorists attempt to enter the country, but have generally not elaborated on where those individuals are apprehended. NBC News on Monday obtained data showing that, in the first half of 2018, Customs and Border Protection stopped a total of six immigrants at the southern border who are now in the terrorism database. President Trump is set to deliver a prime-time address on Tuesday discussing the situation at the border, which he has referred to a crisis. The president has pushed for more than $5 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border, which has precipitated a partial government shutdown that has lasted 18 days and counting.

Matthew Kentner --APRIL??? Try polling them tomorrow.
Karen Harvey Trump said he would never sign it. This was after claiming he would sign any bipartisan legislation that came across his desk.
Karen Harvey Ah, so sad about the 60 needed votes. Where are Trump's much vaunted negotiating and deal making skills? Didn't he campaign on being the best deal maker in the history the world?  And speaking of obstructionist: The Senate passed the VERY SAME BILL the Democrats just passed in the House to reopen the government -- passed it by 90 to 10, a bipartisan vote. But oh, that was before the new House came in. Now Mitch McConnell won't even put THAT SAME BILL to a Senate vote.
Calvin Wright God Bless You.
Karen Harvey ask yourself why didn‚Äôt it pass?
Karen Harvey why didn‚Äôt we take that money to build the wall last year?
Read this John Mutyaba :  ‚ÄúFalse Says Sen. Chuck Schumer in 2014 "helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall" and now opposes Trump's $5 billion request for a border wall "just because he's a Republican." ‚Äã ‚Äî Bloggers on Monday, December 17th, 2018 in a blog post Meme mischaracterizes Chuck Schumer's record on border security funding  By John Kruzel on Thursday, December 20th, 2018 at 11:10 a.m.  A meme gaining traction on social media claims Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., supported a border wall deal during Barack Obama‚Äôs presidency but then flip-flopped once President Donald Trump took the White House.  The post contains a photo of Schumer and a mock first-person confession revealing the Senate minority leader‚Äôs partisan reason for the apparent policy pivot.  "In 2014, I helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall," reads the post from a group called The Right View Of Washington State. "Now, Trump wants $5 billion for a border wall. Well I‚Äôm gonna b----, cry, piss and moan just because he‚Äôs a Republican and wants it."  The post was flagged as part of Facebook‚Äôs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The meme is swimming in factual errors and fishy interpretations.  No border wall deal in 2014 The post says Schumer helped put together a border wall deal in 2014. That‚Äôs wrong ‚Äî there was no border barrier deal that year.  It‚Äôs possible the creator of the post was thinking of a 2013 proposal that Schumer shepherded through the Senate. But characterizing the 2013 legislation as a $25 billion deal to fund a "border wall" runs into factual hurdles.  That proposal, a comprehensive immigration plan Schumer sponsored and voted for, cleared the Senate in 2013. But the Republican-controlled House did not take up that bill after that. (It‚Äôs worth noting that presidents, not lawmakers, as the meme suggests, sign bills into law.)  The package included more than $46 billion for border security. The vast majority of that money ($30 billion) was for hiring more U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. Around $8 billion would have gone toward building or repairing 700 miles of fencing (including some double-layer fencing) along the U.S.-Mexico border.  That‚Äôs not $25 billion for a wall, as the meme claimed.  Fence vs. wall It would be a stretch to say the fencing Schumer supported in 2013 fits the same description as Trump‚Äôs "impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall," with "precasts going up probably 35 to 40 feet in the air."  Schumer‚Äôs office insisted a border fence is very different from Trump‚Äôs promised wall. The senator‚Äôs office pointed us to a Trump tweet from the election when then-candidate Trump scolded his opponent Jeb Bush for conflating the two.  "Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a ‚Äòfence.‚Äô " Trump tweeted. "It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!"  Daniel Yoken, a Schumer spokesman, said, "Sen. Schumer supported fencing where it makes sense then and still does today."  Schumer has also argued that border security isn‚Äôt limited to a wall, and that there are other, more effective ways to secure the border. The meme claims Schumer opposes a wall "just because" Trump is a Republican.  One more point to clarify: Schumer in January 2018 said he offered to back funding for Trump‚Äôs border wall in exchange for a broader immigration package that included a deal for so-called Dreamers, young immigrants living in the country illegally.  Schumer reportedly made a $25 billion offer for the wall during a private meeting with Trump, as lawmakers negotiated a way to avert a government shutdown. Schumer rescinded his offer just a few days after making it, saying it was off the table because Trump rejected the broader immigration package.  The New York Times reported that while the White House refused to acknowledge that Schumer made the wall offer, Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle confirmed it.  An offer on behalf of Schumer‚Äôs part to fund a border wall undermines the meme‚Äôs notion that he‚Äôs automatically ruled out the wall simply because Trump wants it.  Our ruling The Facebook post says Schumer in 2014 "helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall" and now opposes Trump's $5 billion request for a border wall "just because he's a Republican."  There are numerous factual errors here: there was no border barrier deal in 2014. A 2013 legislative package proposed $8 billion for border fencing ‚Äî not $25 billion for a border wall.  More importantly, the border fencing Schumer backed in 2013 is different than how Trump has described his border wall. And the meme glosses over Schumer‚Äôs previous support for border wall funding earlier this year, in exchange for protections for Dreamers.  We rate this post False.‚Äù

Mike Shusterman yes I did read the article. The figures are based on steel prices and approximate measurements. It may not be the exact total, but show me one single construction project that comes in right on budget.  27 Billion in savings.. you get that number from Trump's blathering? There is NO accurate measure of what effect illegal immigration has on the economy.  Meanwhile, Trump's lie count goes up every single day... and you're just sucking it up like a 2 dollar hooker..

Way to brainwash your 8 year old!!!! Statewide, 61 percent of Texans oppose building a wall, while 35 percent support it and 4 percent don‚Äôt know or declined to answer, according to a poll conducted in April by Texas Lyceum, a nonprofit leadership organization. Residents of the Lone Star State who live, work and play along the international boundary with Mexico say they are happy that the Trump administration‚Äôs plans to quickly build the wall have encountered complications in Washington. A dispute over whether to fund the wall nearly led to a federal government shutdown in March, until the president agreed to delay the plan possibly until September. On Tuesday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney unveiled a 2018 budget that includes $2.6 billion for stepped-up border security, including $1.6 billion for a wall.

What service?
John Robert No wall
My message to Donald Trump :   ‚ÄúSure, border security !!! But that does not necessarily mean a 5 billion dollar wall !!! The Democrats also want border security ... but not the 5 billion dollar wall that you are proposing for border security !!! You need to learn how to negotiate and compromise !!! You are used to bullying until you get your own way !!! You have no respect or consideration for the other people with whom you are negotiating !!! You are 71 but you act like a child who hasn‚Äôt learned that he cannot always have his own way !!! You need to grow up !!! I hope the Democrats don‚Äôt let you get away with your bullying ways so that you may learn how to be a mature individual !!! Otherwise you need to be removed from circulation because people like you are a menace and not worthy of living in society with other people ...‚Äù

If it cost 5.6 billion dollars to build the wall, and it cost more than that to the taxpayers in one year to allow them to come in. You can't build half a wall, idiot, then police the other half. I hope for people like you, an illegal rapes or kills someone you love, maybe they will escape back to Mexico like the man who killed my nephew's friend. You democrats and liberals needed your asses whipped, go see if you can sneak into another country, and what theyed do to you if you got caught. If we'd allow everyone to come here and help them, we'd all have to work 24 hrs. a day to support all the freebies your political party keeps handing out. People like you amaze me at the lack of brains you have...

John Robert OK, here's your compromise and solution. Have the 1.8 million DACA aka *dreamers* pay 5k each for US Citizenship. Wall gets funded, DACA's become citizens and best part? Mexican's funded the wall! (Mic drop!)

Amanda Marioni Hunt same as using drones or other security methods for border security. You have to apprehend the illegal immigrants. Common sense says catching them as the come through gates is much easier than mass groups coming over open land or insufficient fencing. Like wise apprehending a boat is easier than swimmers.
Matthew Kentner and of the 61% that oppose - how many are here LEGALLY? https://nationaleconomicseditorial.com/2017/04/07/illegal-immigration-costs-analysis-texas/
Diane Ruckdeschel the Democrats could fix it all and "save the daca kids" in ONE VOTE....let's wait and see what they do...they don't care about the daca kids or the federal employees...they only care about votes....they voted for the wall in 2006 (Obama, shumer and Hillary Clinton, they only are opposing now because they hate Trump. They change their policies as often as they change their underwear.wake up people...they don't care about you....if they did they would make policies that didn't keep people stuck on food stamps and welfare. They WANT YOU DEPENDAND ON ON THEM!

Barbara Hansen it will save billions of dollars.. article from may of 2016: ‚ÄúCriminal aliens ‚Äî non-citizens who commit crimes ‚Äî are a growing threat to public safety and national security, as well as a drain on our scarce criminal justice resources. In 1980, our federal and state prisons housed fewer than 9,000 criminal aliens. Today, about 55,000 criminal aliens account for more than one-fourth of prisoners in Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities, and there are about 297,000 criminal aliens incarcerated in state and local prisons. That number represents about 16.4 percent of the state and local prison population compared to the 12.9 percent of the total population comprised of foreign-born residents.

Vicki Zamow Troll
Ronald Penn what did they lie about?
What total ignorance!  That wall will not stop the terrorism that will arrive on American soil after we cede control of the Mideast to Russia.
"A shutdown falls on the president's lack of leadership. I mean problems start from the top and they have to get solved from the top. A shutdown means the president is weak". - Donald J. Trump, 2013.
Kris Knight wow how ignorant can you be? Do you have any idea how many of your fellow syphocantic 45 worshippers have screamed about "the civil war" they will start and indiscriminately kill people because 45 is a gd joke and we let him know it?
This sums up the shutdown from the framework of our government. It lays out the facts. I am sharing this from another person who posted and please do share as well. I am not normally political. This post will be an exception because I am an American and I am concerned. Please allow me to frame the issues involved with "the wall" in its actual terms. Despite what the media is saying, this is not about Democrat vs. Republican. In short, the executive branch of our government is threatening to declare a national emergency since the legislative branch will not authorize the seizure of private American property for a federal works project nor will fund it. The executive branch has already shut down the federal government. It is currently threatening to extend this government shut down for however long it takes for the legislative branch to cave. Let us break this down. First of all, the framework of our government is based on checks and balances. Power is divided into three branches: the Executive, the Legislative, and the Judicial. The Legislative branch controls the purse strings of government and creates laws. The Executive branch carries out those laws. The Judicial branch tells us whether the laws are constitutional or not. Each branch was designed to be able to balance the other branches. Why? As shown by our original rebellion, Americans didn't want a King or a Dictator when we were setting up our government. We were not particularly thrilled with a House of Lords telling us what we could or could not do either. In this case, the executive branch wants to: (1) take governmental cash,  (2) create its own law,  (3) take away private property from American citizens  (4) create its own federal works project. At least three of these functions fall within the power/ responsibility of the legislative branch. So, what is the problem? This is one of the most naked power grabs by the executive branch over the others in recent history. Once that power is exercised, it is going to be difficult or impossible to regain any balance again. The executive branch was never meant to have that much power (see our country's previous concerns about Kings and Dictators). Is this constitutional? Very doubtful. Should all Americans be concerned? That is a question for you to answer yourself. Second, a "National Emergency" is generally declared under these general conditions:  (1) Natural disasters including hurricanes, tornados, and earthquakes to name a few.  (2) Public health emergencies such as significant outbreaks of infectious diseases.  (3) Military attacks.  (4) Civil insurrection. (5) Any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy. Now the first 4 aren't applicable. The last category was meant to be short-term only. It was designed to be reviewed by the legislative branch every year after it‚Äôs enacted (because again; the check and balance is fundamental to how we operate). So, what is the problem here? If national emergencies can be declared by the executive branch for non-emergency purposes which vest power in one branch of the government why would that branch ever let go of that power again? Third, the seizure of private property (known as ‚Äúeminent domain‚Äù, a body of law which says the government cannot just take your home without due process). You are joking, right? No. The US/Mexican border is 1,933 miles long. It runs through 4 states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas). Only 33% of that land is actually owned or managed by the Federal Government. A sizable percentage of that land is owned by the Indian nations. It is land preserved for those tribes by treaty and land given under treaty is not land owned by the United States. These tribes already have a lot of reasons to be angry at the Federal Government. This would be pouring additional gas on an open flame. The other 64% of that land is privately owned. How much land would have to be taken? The amount of land that the Federal Government would have to take would likely run 1,237 miles long to 12,371 miles deep (assuming a 1 to 10-mile DMZ from the border into the United States). Even if we could only take 100 to 500 ft of land in densely populated areas, that is a lot of private property that is going to be seized by the Federal government. The land necessary for this project would also run through some highly populated areas in the US such as San Diego, Calexico, Nogales, El Paso, and Laredo. There will be a lot of Americans who are going to have their homes and businesses taken by the federal government. Which will also mean a lot of lawsuits. In terms of the federal works project, these types of works include hospitals, bridges, highways, walls and dams. These projects may be funded by local, state, or federal appropriations. If they are federal, they are funded by the legislative branch of our government (the same branch that our executive branch is currently trying to take power from). Is the seizure of power constitutional? Not likely given the separation of powers discussed above. Finally, these considerations do not take into account the sheer cost, human and monetary, that will be involved. The Department of Homeland Security estimates the current cost at $21 billion for construction alone (not counting costs of maintenance or costs associated with increased military/federal patrolling). Ask yourself a simple question. When was the last time that you saw a governmental project brought in under time and under budget? Does anyone remember the ‚Äúbig dig‚Äù in Boston, Mass? The actual costs are likely to be much higher. This estimated cost also does not include compensating folks for taking their land or the associated impact upon their businesses. The Federal budget deficit grew to $779 billion dollars in 2018 according to the Treasury Department. How are we, as a country, going to fund this project? How are we, as a country, going to deal with the additional debt? Unlike private businesses, our country cannot declare bankruptcy. This is not about Democrat vs. Republican. It is not about who has the best zingers measured in 10 second sound bites. It is about our country. The core of this issue deals with the profound and immense changes the outcome will have on the structure of our national. This is the way that we, as a country, should be framing these issues. Please think about it." Please share!

Greg Merz that's because drugs drug money and cheap labor runs through that state as the illegal immigrants arrive.
Shaun Dillavou okay I'll play lets do it.  FUN FACT: On Dec 18th, McConnell said there was no more money for the border and wouldn't be. The house version had more for the border and Trump tweeted that he would sign. Then Limbaugh and the pointy heads at FOX NEWS cried and cried all day until they goaded him into reversing himself.  BONUS FACT: He would have got 12.5 billion for his wall in early 2017 if he would have gave the DACA's citizenship. The "Deal Maker" doesn't seem to understand how to make "Deals", it's not just holding your breath until you get your way.
They are ate up with  Bad Case of the Dumbass !!

Heather Gurtlinger What lies?What an idiot. Better to ask when has he ever spoke the truth. All he ever does is lie.
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46784315
Heather Gurtlinger he lied about the 4000 people that were criminals arrested at the southern border, only 12 of those 4000 came from the southern border, he lied to the American people every day he lies to his wives about how many times he cheats on them, then he lies about paying off the whores that he cheated with, he lies about hiring the best people, he hires crooks and that's it. He lies about knowing the most about everything he ever possibly talks about, because he doesn't know a damn thing about anything, except for running businesses and countries into the ground and bankrupting them. He lied about getting a one million dollar loan from his father to start his business because he already had over 8 billion dollars at that point from all the tax fraud him and his father committed. He lied about being a Christian, the only time he's ever been in a church is for a photo op or to try to talk the hypocritical evangelist into supporting him. I could go on and on, but you've obviously drank the kool aid and you're too stupid to realize when you're being lied to, that's why Trump says he loves the poorly educated he likes them stupid, so they believe his lies.

Greg Merz the only one who put those kids in "cages" are their scumbag families trying to enter our country ILLEGALLY, To skirt the system and receive the free benefits then keep making babies to stay here... Well that's no longer allowed. Get over it. You want them here open your home doors..  Unlock the doors leave them wide open and let them live off YOUR PAYCHECK
Gina Mcknight, I'm so thankful for the sovereignty of God in my life and in the affairs of nations.  I am thankful to God with all my heart we were spared a presidency by HRC who has "values" which are counter to mine in countless areas.
Greg Merz, our differences probably stem from what we read and listen to rather than some of the other things you suggested.  My sources include Kerby Anderson with Point of View Radio Talk Show, the ACLJ, the The Daily Signal, etc.  I'm aware of the positions presented by the MSM, but I don't use any of them solely as my source as I want both sides as I make decisions.  Also, the Bible is a source of knowledge and wisdom for me as well, and it's timeless and helpful to all.  (Caron)
RudiToonen...at the very least, it usually means that there is very little trust between them.

Mike N Caron you're not religious then, you're deluded.
Brenda Williams Dennis another delusional religious hypocrite joins the conversation?
Jesus would be against the wall. He would welcome the refugees in and help them.
Mary Apollonio I'd say a majority of people against the wall have children or grandchildren. If you are for the wall and have kids, you're a shitty parent.
Mike N Caron so you - as a person - are for barring the downtrodden from a potentially better life?  I thought you were supposed to live according to god's teachings and resist evil?
Greg Merz, my goodness, what have I said that makes you assume that?  (Caron)

Joan Porter just McConnell.
Chris Humenik he doesn't need a paycheck, he is making a load of money off his golf course.  Each meeting he holds there earns him a lot of money....food/accommodation/cleaning service/security/phone/internet/electricity/etc...all cost money  he's a snake

He LIED. Doesn't that matter to you?  ‚ÄúHe is shutting down the government to break his signature campaign promise. His signature campaign promise was that the taxpayers weren‚Äôt going to have to pay for it.‚Äù House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Smith said on ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù
Annie Jacobs Stevens For 5,6 Bn you could built 10 big factories and give work to thousands of Americans AND Immigrants for years, without even producing ANYTHING!!!  There is no CRISIS at the boarder  A Crisis is what he is telling about IS beaten....
Janet Braden Duvall the government is of We The People... educate yourselves! If you are a federal employee..you are the people funded by the people and if the people dispute the purse that funds security and protection for the people... yes.. some people will not be paid for a while or a long while... if you don‚Äôt like it... don‚Äôt work for the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù!!! This is what happens when We The People are too grand.... and we the people become the bargaining ‚Äúchip‚Äù !! Hold firm - #WeThePeople want #TheWall  this wall will save us money in so many ways!! Health costs, housing costs, educational cost, food costs, and more jobs for American teenagers! #Winning good job President Donald J. Trump
Emil D√∂rr your actually in that park. I‚Äôm self sufficient and more likely providing all your benefits.
Maik Schrank enough is enough. Tear down your wall or your fence around your home.. let them in! Oh wait... you probably don‚Äôt own! So we‚Äôre supporting all your needs! $$$$ is costly feeding, housing, healthcare, educating all these illegals.

Annie Jacobs Stevens Who is going to pay for the wall?
Sherry Carruth President Trump is trying to do all he promised but the demos will not stop oh, who cares who pays for it us taxpayers pay for every other damn corrupt thing in this country, so I say if we have to pay for something this wall would be a nice change. Just my opinion but I'd rather my tax paying dollars go to building this wall then feeding people that don't belong here and don't have to abide by the laws that I have to abide by.
Annie Jacobs Stevens Who is going to pay for the wall?
Mark Rolston For 5,6 Bn you could built 10 big factories and give work to thousands of Americans AND Immigrants.   There is no CRISIS at the boarder  A Crisis is what he is telling about IS beaten....

I guess the 2 year point is the time for the Democrats to act up just like they did when he was elected. Note to Dems.....The Democrat leadership wants a civil war under Trump and YOU want to give it to them. Just letting you know.
The Dems found a wedge issue to try and pit us against each other. You fell for their game!!! BWAAAHAAAHAA!!! You've been played!
Statewide, 61 percent of Texans oppose building a wall, while 35 percent support it and 4 percent don‚Äôt know or declined to answer, according to a poll conducted in April by Texas Lyceum, a nonprofit leadership organization. Residents of the Lone Star State who live, work and play along the international boundary with Mexico say they are happy that the Trump administration‚Äôs plans to quickly build the wall have encountered complications in Washington. A dispute over whether to fund the wall nearly led to a federal government shutdown in March, until the president agreed to delay the plan possibly until September. On Tuesday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney unveiled a 2018 budget that includes $2.6 billion for stepped-up border security, including $1.6 billion for a wall.

Stephen Pierson And you know for a fact that he didn't repent and, of course, you also know he committed this sin.  OMG," let he who is without sin cast the first stone".  Doesn't matter what the sin is.  Let's not forget about Pres. Billy Boy!!!!!!
Dan Shill right there says your a hater and you think it's alright your also saying whatever you say is what goes and to inform you  old age professor you remember when Obama was in office he and his goonies basically banned God because they were offended you got that how are  you keeping up there's more and who the He-- are you to say Trump is a fool of Satan are you as demon in disguise
Mark Rolston another gool
Mark Rolston wish god are you talking about
Mark rolston your one of the deplorables is clear why white EDUCATED american didnt vote for trump.. only the trash did
The Dems found a wedge issue to try and pit us against each other. You fell for their game!!! BWAAAHAAAHAA!!! You've been played!
The demon may bless Trump?
Janet Braden Duvall at this rate you'll have enough for a wall in about 50 years... That's if you maintained the rate you had in the first 3 days... It's no where close to that now...üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Greg Merz you a crack head ?
Mark Rolston Impeach the MoFo!!

With a medevil time wall?
Diana Acosta  Is that all Americans or only his base.
Bethany Kessel  actually by building the wall it will free up billions of dollars that are used to house, feed, medical and legal fees that are used on illegal immigrants when they are caught. So by lowering the amount of illegal immigrants that are flooding into this country will free up money that can be used to help the American citizens.
Bethany Kessel are you taking care of them? I donate. My father served.
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin At the moment you insult people anything you say is worthless.
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don‚Äôt support it. Don‚Äôt say we.
Donna Snowden Protect Americans. Everyone.
Janet Braden Duvall... you realize that is a scam? The money collected will never go to fund the wall
Alison Edwards Lorentz DACA recipients won't pay $5,000 most of them don't have $5
Cant protect americans by only covering less than a fourth of our border
Diana Acosta wow does that mean you too???
Bottom line is yall dont care about americans bc if you did yall would take the time to help our homeless, children and vets but yall dont ever try too but when it comes to this wall it has to be done......i really dont wanna hear we gotta protect americans first when you could care less
Diana Acosta Why do the Trump Zealots always make False Claims and False Accusation with great regularity??? Why do they have such an obsessive detachment from the Truth???
Charity Nolan We The People do not support the Wall but if the duped Trump Cult want to waste their money paying for it......so be it!!!
Alex Traynor the great wall of china worked pretty well for a while
Donna Snowden Protect Americans. Everyone.
Georgiann Gonsalves your wrong. Citizens want illegals immigrants to stop entering the US.
Georgiann Gonsalves stop drugs, criminals, and gangs. You don‚Äôt live near the border. You seem not to care about citizens dying .
https://www.gofundme.com/TheTrumpWall
Diana Acosta OK, here's your compromise and solution. Have the 1.8 million DACA aka *dreamers* pay 5k each for US Citizenship. Wall gets funded, DACA's become citizens and best part? Mexican's funded the wall! (Mic drop!)
https://www.callmycongress.com/callmycongress.com
Maik Schrank do you live in the US?
Alison Edwards Lorentz DACA was unconstitutional. I really think DACA will not benefit America in anyway. All of them including all visa overstays and illegals immigrants need to be deported.

Protect Americans from Americans with Assault Rifles, who goes in schools, churches, synagogues, night clubs, movie theatres, etc, and BRUTALLY SLAUGHTER INNOCENT AMERICANS BY THE DOZENS, INCLUDING TODDLERS AND CHILDREN LIKE IN SANDY HOOK , CT,, HOW ABOUT YOU BUILD A FREAKING WALL AROUND THEM TOO HUH?? HOW ARE YOU PROTECTING YOURSELF FROM HOME GROWN TERRORISTS AND MURDERERS??
Diana Acosta Morons,  i would say PROTECT IMMIGRANTS BEFORE NAZIS AND RACISTS AND KILLER
Kelly Dunham Hardin so what is your proposition for all those illegals flying in here?  if you are truly concerned of illegals....why aren't you fighting for the president to stop those coming in with their f1/j1 visas?  you do know those are the ones who take our higher paying jobs, right?  they speak more than one or even two languages,,,,they take high paying jobs from us easily....you think that's right?
Protect Americans! Pray every night before you go to sleep that the ANTI-CHRIST in the Oval Office drops dead in his sleep!!!
Diana Acosta ABSOLUTELY....THE WALL IS NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION....PEOPLE WILL ESCAPE INTO US WHEN THEY REALLY WANT TO,..SECURE BORDERS..,PERIOD!!!!

Kelly Dunham Hardin That's right, Kelly!
Sarah Jobe maybe she should have gotten a better education in something like this happen to you..If YOU ,,Yourself cant take care of what you bore for let's say 20 yrs ,cant afford them dont have them .if YOU Afford 1 have 1 ,2 have 2 an so forth.Dont bore them if you cant feed educate housing electric water .clothing any an all care for that say 20..makes since to me an it's all pretty simple if you think about it..us tax payers are not your babies daddy ...oh but what did he die from? Never mind it really doesn't matter..no one give real details
An if you didnt read what I said ...I said she WAS doing as she should ,in so many words without looking back
Is*...
Maria Rodriguez your a true piece of feces... Do u speak English?? Do you understand your a nothing??? And to the rest of you IDIOTS Gina Walker never once said she was on govt assistance.... Y'all are are so stupid... She is working 3 jobs that are funding illegals to get help that belongs to our country... #BuildTheWall
Enrique Miller commiefornia figures.
Honey, that's your local government raping you blind.
Dianne Camper how do you know her circumstances? She may be a widow for all you know.... How do you know she is on welfare? She didn't state that she was. Maybe it was her way of saying that her money would be better spent going to get own kids.. this is nuts
I haven't met anyone that works 3 jobs qualify for welfare.. unless you count the illegals which are getting paid under the table and not paying taxes
So assuming that she is getting aid, is on you. But you can plan children you can afford and then something can bring your life crashing down.
Kelly Dunham Hardin That's right, Kelly!

You have a great point, it‚Äôs better to shutdown the country to provide healthcare services to US citizens rather than a Wall that won‚Äôt stop the problem since more illegals are due to overstayed visas that come through airport and not by the border üëç

that is not the definition of a democrat.  It is absolutely absurd how everyone now believes that one democrat's behaviour represents all.  A white male Christian murdered a group of people in a church at prayer. Does that mean that all white male Christians are evil murderers?  Do you see how ridiculous it is to group everyone into one pile?  This divisiveness by the president is dangerous, and you are the perfect example to the danger....so much anger...winning yet so full of anger and unhappiness
Gordon Ashackersson no that would be forced or get penalized

The real problem with people over staying their visa's are the people who say nothing if they know someone who is over staying their visa's.
No, that isn‚Äôt at all what it is like. A wall is a moronic idea that will never happen with or without the funding because the land is privately owned. It will be tied up in courts for decades! It is an unnecessary waste of resources. Since you people resist reliable news sources, I strongly suggest you start looking at objective data. Court filings, the US Army Risk Assessment..,etc. Or, don‚Äôt and be gobsmacked when you find out just how idiotic your comments were, and how close you came to losing the country you profess to love.

Angus Crawford but he was coerced and him and his family threatened with jail time after he wouldn't go along with Mueller. All these trials and admitting crimes has been forced by Mueller. His actions are not  allowed toward murders but he's getting away with it for the so called collusion bs.
Smith Helen Jessica only because you don‚Äôt like the outcome
Smith Helen Jessica if you let a Russian in the voting booth with you that is your stupidity. The American citizens voted for Donald Trump.  No Russians were in the booth with them. Live in your fairytale Russian collusion that they put Trump into office.  The only ties to Russia is the fake dossier paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign, which was used to open an investigation. I do not give a crap about anything Manafort did.  The citizens of the United States voted but the democrats cannot accept the election of Donald Trump.
Rigged? So was your birth Smith Helen Jessica... The best part of you ran down your moms leg. She should‚Äôve swallowed.

Kevin Couture how many illegal immigrants are you willing to take into your household?
Trump knows how ridiculous this wall is..he knew democrats wouldn't go for it because of how ridiculous the amount of money he wants..he knew this would happend..and he let it because he knew you guys would fall for the "this is the democrats fault" and you guys are really biting rhe bait. At least we can see people true colors now. Smh

Kevin Couture you liberal moron, no matter what you think TRUMP IS STILL YOUR PRESIDENT ! MAGA ! GO TRUMP ! TRUMP 2020 !
Aquaman for President in 2020
Kevin Couture all I see from you is that your only uneducated comments are name calling. I'm guessing you're way too stupid to have an adult conversation. You're a typical unintelligent liberal.

No wonder you think you don't need a wall up there in Maine, but you could be fooled and care about the rest of us.
So this is how you try to feel relevant, you must not have any children with special needs. You lose all credibility when you use the word Tard, take a look in the mirror scumbag.
Bert Bowers if his mom did anal we wouldn't have to deal with him
Hes just concerned about vengeful lobsters
Kevin Couture  Remember when President Trump said"if you like your insurance you can keep your insurance. Period?" Oh wait.  Remember when President Trump told the story of being shot at by snipers? Oh wait.   So how many illegals live with you? No I didn't think so.  You don't lock your doors, home or car ever do you? No I didn't think so. Hypocrite.
Kevin wants unregistered immigrants in this country.  He loves the fact that he can exploit the labor and he supports corporations doing the same.  His hatred for immigrants is deep,  he wants to use them and give them no access to the privileges actual citizens enjoy.  He'd own slaves if he could.
Kevin Couture eat dick asshole.

Lisa Palmer Fleming thank you for calling me a dimwit - it shows how kind you are
Becky Geyer Price nobody is perfect. Only Jesus Christ, and he knows that! Its whats in your heart.
Davita Levao Jesus would confront him like he did the Pharisees. Except the Pharisees didn‚Äôt actually teach hate and intolerance. So Jesus would have a field day with teaching the president
Davita Levao Really?  Read the Good Book...KJV... Ephesians 5:5. ..there is no room in the kingdom of God for a whoremonger
Davita Levao.. Who are you to judge? That's Gods Job..Not Yours. I know you cannot Walk on Water. Shame on You!!
Becky Geyer Price , who did he murder? David committed adultry and murdered her husband, who was David's loyal servant, yet God still used him for his own purpose.
Davita Levao but Jesus would not be a pussy grabbing lying adulterer more likely Trump is the spawn of Satan
Kelley McComb are you really going to compare the god of the old testament with the God of the new testament, you want all the genicide, slavery, stoning and incest...really you must miss the old days (3000 years ago)ü§£

Davita Levao dear lord, it seems Davita was born without a brain - please lord give her one with the intelligence to realize that the cult 45 and it‚Äôs sinners are a bad thing bigly.  Jesus please help the retarded Davita realize praying on FB is not only stupid it‚Äôs completely and epically sinful !! Thanks god for the Democrats that now rule the house and soon the senate and presidency - send all the sinful Trumpanzees straight to their hell - thanks dear lord !!

We have a massive defense budget already. What's fiscally responsible about spending more money when we have some 50% of the budget is already for defense?
Johnnie Powell unlike most spending, this would pay itself back in a year; even if it‚Äôs only 10% effective
Its not about the money it's because Miss NANCY has a chip on her shoulder for the President... For some reason the woman has a power problem an maybe a bit of a control freak. (Honestly wear would she get maids an lawn boys for the price she puts in Americans laps...lol)

Michael Wilson they were for it before they are now against it; why?! The issue is the same. What Obama and Schumer said in 2009 is just as true (if not more so) as it is today.   In other words the only thing that changed is the politics of if. They don‚Äôt like the person saying it, so they must resist like Trump is the Borg queen or something. Not even Captain Janeway could negotiate with people who argue against themselves! Lol

Treava Lancaster he must be a battle star galactic warrior, still living in cartoon world and believes bunnies and kitties died for him. His intelligence just oozes out of his comments.
The walls and fences around people's homes are there more to distinguish property lines, than to keep people out.   If someone was really determined to get in to your property. How long do you think it would take for someone to jump your wall or fence, my guess is not very long.   What really deters people from entering is survelience equipment, like cameras and security lighting or a dog, which acts as a pseudo guard.   The 2 billion that has been agreed on by the house and senate is by far more than enough money. To spend on more border patrol agents, increasing security features at the southern border and other ports of entry where the most illegal drugs, come in through.   But why can't the members of Cult 45 comprehend that.

Treava Lancaster absolutely they must all have fences and doors that don‚Äôt work on their houses and they took God out of country back when Obama was in office
Kevin Fo-Shizzle Oravits Don‚Äôt forget about these shutdowns... just saying!   December 5, 1995, to January 6, 1996 President: Bill Clinton  Senate: Republicans (53-47), Majority Leader Bob Dole  House: Republicans (235-198), Speaker Newt Gingrich  Why: This shutdown, which lasted the better part of a month, was all about whether to use economic forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget to determine whether the White House‚Äôs budget plan would balance. The CBO was more cautious, and projected that Clinton would still have a $115 billion deficit in seven years under his plan. Republicans eventually caved after 21 days, and Clinton then proposed a plan that the CBO agreed balanced the budget. Some 284,000 workers were furloughed, in the longest shutdown in history.  October 1 to 17, 2013 President: Barack Obama  Senate: Democrats (54-46), Majority Leader Harry Reid  House: Republicans (232-200), Speaker John Boehner  Why: Ted Cruz, basically. While House Republicans, led by Boehner, had pressured the White House into agreeing to lower levels of discretionary spending, and conservatives in the House led by Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA) demanded that any funding bill delay implementation of Obamacare by a year. It was set to roll out the following year, and conservatives, most vocally led by Cruz and Heritage Action, were desperate to stop it before it gained beneficiaries who could defend it politically. Enough House conservatives got on board with the plan to make it impossible to pass a continuing resolution, and the government shut down.  After 17 days, Boehner folded and passed a funding bill that did not defund Obamacare and that most of his caucus opposed. Roughly 850,000 workers, or about 40 percent of the federal workforce, were furloughed.  Oh, how the left loves to forget! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Old news
President Trump, ask the Democrats Pelosi, Schumer, Clinton, Obama if they would be OK with illegals/migrants climbing over their walls and entering their houses illegally, if they would be OK with it?

Trump is exposing communism in New Mexico and in California
James McCaskill If you support the wall call this number 800-350-6647 then press 1 it tells the government we want the wall. I just did it.  Copied and reposted Nancy's number 202-225-4965 left message... build the wall. Here's Chuck's 202-224-7433. Be professional, but demand the wall funds.  Repost numbers. Let's do this. Leave a message, Build the Wall! Everyone call!! Fill their machines with BUILD THE WALL!!! If mailboxes are full PRESS 3 and leave a message.
James McCaskill comparing the southern border to a house is moronic..
James McCaskill there‚Äôs a lock on my house, but if someone wanted to get in, they could. The border is no different. I don‚Äôt have a fence around my house. One isn‚Äôt needed because if someone wanted to come over it to break into my house, they would. The fence wouldn‚Äôt stop them, but I‚Äôd be out a lot of money. See the similarities?  The only way to keep out intruders would be with other methods, like a watchdog or obvious cameras. The point is, there are more effective methods.
Trump is exposing communism in New Mexico and in California
James McCaskill because the idiots that cause most crime statistically are already here. Mexicans can get through my fence as I gave them a key so they can rake my leaves and clean the pool.
Vinnie Paul no it isn't moronic. If you are so against a wall, then take in 3 families of illegal immigrants, provide fiid, shelter, healthcare, etc and be held responsible for any crimes they commit.

Who ever pays for the wall will build the wall. You really want Mexico to build your wall?  Lmfao
He NEVER said they would write a check! Omg. Stop it already.
He lied as usual

You dems have the same weak talking points!! Dearing his campaign he said I know Mexico wont cut a check for the wall but we will be reimbursed threw trade!! You bems love tell half truths!!
Another simpleton weighs in...Jesus Christ. That has got to be deliberate. People cannot be that stupid. People who cannot construct a simple sentence are calling other people weak and stupid. Wtf is even going on here?! It‚Äôs just embarrassing.
Like I said, embarrassing.
Good idea. Reverse psychology. It always works on the weak minded.
When trump was asked who was paying for the wall, he said ‚ÄúMexico is going to pay for it‚Äù  If you want to spin it to fit your narrative than that‚Äôs up to you. I prefer to take what he says at face value and believe none of it. He‚Äôs a fraud and a liar.
He lied as usual
Donald Trump promised that Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Now he is demanding that we pay for it or else. I don‚Äôt disagree that we need border security.
Peggy Scott..do you?
Anissa Thomas drumpf loves the uneducated üòÇ  Time for English class comrade

So are all of you ok with this shutdown AND paying for the wall out of your taxes?
Wtf does healthcare have to do with that dumb wall?
Your original post is rude. So....yes? You‚Äôre all ok with having funds for the wall come out of your taxes?
Sure do.
Republicans again. You can tell by their inability to construct a sentence. Simpleton.
Do you get that if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, or that healthcare costs will go down? Kinda the same thing.
I would too!

Jesse McMurray yes but they knocked first
How about this Nancy Pelosi just added 12 billion extra dollars to Foreign countries for abortion, so why can‚Äôt we get the 5 billion from that money.
Vanessa Nguyen  But a wall is not a door. A wall doesn‚Äôt have locks.
Diane Smith  Omg, are you brainless.  Do I have to literally explain everything to you.   Think  Locking your door will not guarantee the thieves won‚Äôt break in your house, but not locking your house will greatly increase chance of having thieves breaking your house Having a border wall will not eliminate 100% of illegal immigrants, but it will greatly reduce the number of illegal immigrants.   Doing nothing will not eliminate illegals  The truth is all those liberals against border wall are making excuses so that we will not have the border, and the illegals from all over the world are free to sneak in America any time they want.
Debbie Derenthall you're so Pretty
Cora Pantoja SO true
Jason Grader me!! I would donate 2 weeks as well
James Smith do you lock your door when people come and ask you for help?
Jesse McMurray , not if they come the right way, not by jumping my fence.
Cora Pantoja SO true
Jesse McMurray  First, you don‚Äôt leave you door open so anyone can get into your house. Second, if someone knocks on your door, you have to screen him first.  If you have your door open, then anyone, including murderer, and thieves will live in your home.

Yay, finally an intelligent American ...  My message to Donald Trump :   ‚ÄúSure, border security !!! But that does not necessarily mean a 5 billion dollar wall !!! The Democrats also want border security ... but not the 5 billion dollar wall that you are proposing for border security !!! You need to learn how to negotiate and compromise !!! You are used to bullying until you get your own way !!! You have no respect or consideration for the other people with whom you are negotiating !!! You are 71 but you act like a child who hasn‚Äôt learned that he cannot always have his own way !!! You need to grow up !!! I hope the Democrats don‚Äôt let you get away with your bullying ways so that you may learn how to be a mature individual !!! Otherwise you need to be removed from circulation because people like you are a menace and not worthy of living in society with other people ...‚Äù

Both sides of Congress should go without salary for a year it would solve all of our financial issues.
Richard Smith He can declare a national emergency but like his other executive orders will be struck down by the courts & he can‚Äôt have Pelosi or Schumer arrested. Obviously by your posts the US is grossly underfunding mental health.
I think you're thinking of Russia or North Korea--we are nation of laws--not tyranny.Here, there are three EQUAL branches of government--not one is above the rest. If you don't like it, well, I suspect you know how that phrase ends.
Barbara Stockwell, The Dems just took control of the House. The Republicans had all 3 branches for 2 years. If it really was an emergency don't you think they would have passed A bill for the wall?
Dems there coming for u
My message to Donald Trump :   ‚ÄúSure, border security !!! But that does not necessarily mean a 5 billion dollar wall !!! The Democrats also want border security ... but not the 5 billion dollar wall that you are proposing for border security !!! You need to learn how to negotiate and compromise !!! You are used to bullying until you get your own way !!! You have no respect or consideration for the other people with whom you are negotiating !!! You are 71 but you act like a child who hasn‚Äôt learned that he cannot always have his own way !!! You need to grow up !!! I hope the Democrats don‚Äôt let you get away with your bullying ways so that you may learn how to be a mature individual !!! Otherwise you need to be removed from circulation because people like you are a menace and not worthy of living in society with other people ...‚Äù

You socialist communists prove how stupid half of America is
Statewide, 61 percent of Texans oppose building a wall, while 35 percent support it and 4 percent don‚Äôt know or declined to answer, according to a poll conducted in April by Texas Lyceum, a nonprofit leadership organization. Residents of the Lone Star State who live, work and play along the international boundary with Mexico say they are happy that the Trump administration‚Äôs plans to quickly build the wall have encountered complications in Washington. A dispute over whether to fund the wall nearly led to a federal government shutdown in March, until the president agreed to delay the plan possibly until September. On Tuesday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney unveiled a 2018 budget that includes $2.6 billion for stepped-up border security, including $1.6 billion for a wall.

Read this Jan Houck :  ‚ÄúFalse Says Sen. Chuck Schumer in 2014 "helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall" and now opposes Trump's $5 billion request for a border wall "just because he's a Republican." ‚Äã ‚Äî Bloggers on Monday, December 17th, 2018 in a blog post Meme mischaracterizes Chuck Schumer's record on border security funding  By John Kruzel on Thursday, December 20th, 2018 at 11:10 a.m.  A meme gaining traction on social media claims Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., supported a border wall deal during Barack Obama‚Äôs presidency but then flip-flopped once President Donald Trump took the White House.  The post contains a photo of Schumer and a mock first-person confession revealing the Senate minority leader‚Äôs partisan reason for the apparent policy pivot.  "In 2014, I helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall," reads the post from a group called The Right View Of Washington State. "Now, Trump wants $5 billion for a border wall. Well I‚Äôm gonna b----, cry, piss and moan just because he‚Äôs a Republican and wants it."  The post was flagged as part of Facebook‚Äôs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The meme is swimming in factual errors and fishy interpretations.  No border wall deal in 2014 The post says Schumer helped put together a border wall deal in 2014. That‚Äôs wrong ‚Äî there was no border barrier deal that year.  It‚Äôs possible the creator of the post was thinking of a 2013 proposal that Schumer shepherded through the Senate. But characterizing the 2013 legislation as a $25 billion deal to fund a "border wall" runs into factual hurdles.  That proposal, a comprehensive immigration plan Schumer sponsored and voted for, cleared the Senate in 2013. But the Republican-controlled House did not take up that bill after that. (It‚Äôs worth noting that presidents, not lawmakers, as the meme suggests, sign bills into law.)  The package included more than $46 billion for border security. The vast majority of that money ($30 billion) was for hiring more U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. Around $8 billion would have gone toward building or repairing 700 miles of fencing (including some double-layer fencing) along the U.S.-Mexico border.  That‚Äôs not $25 billion for a wall, as the meme claimed.  Fence vs. wall It would be a stretch to say the fencing Schumer supported in 2013 fits the same description as Trump‚Äôs "impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall," with "precasts going up probably 35 to 40 feet in the air."  Schumer‚Äôs office insisted a border fence is very different from Trump‚Äôs promised wall. The senator‚Äôs office pointed us to a Trump tweet from the election when then-candidate Trump scolded his opponent Jeb Bush for conflating the two.  "Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a ‚Äòfence.‚Äô " Trump tweeted. "It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!"  Daniel Yoken, a Schumer spokesman, said, "Sen. Schumer supported fencing where it makes sense then and still does today."  Schumer has also argued that border security isn‚Äôt limited to a wall, and that there are other, more effective ways to secure the border. The meme claims Schumer opposes a wall "just because" Trump is a Republican.  One more point to clarify: Schumer in January 2018 said he offered to back funding for Trump‚Äôs border wall in exchange for a broader immigration package that included a deal for so-called Dreamers, young immigrants living in the country illegally.  Schumer reportedly made a $25 billion offer for the wall during a private meeting with Trump, as lawmakers negotiated a way to avert a government shutdown. Schumer rescinded his offer just a few days after making it, saying it was off the table because Trump rejected the broader immigration package.  The New York Times reported that while the White House refused to acknowledge that Schumer made the wall offer, Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle confirmed it.  An offer on behalf of Schumer‚Äôs part to fund a border wall undermines the meme‚Äôs notion that he‚Äôs automatically ruled out the wall simply because Trump wants it.  Our ruling The Facebook post says Schumer in 2014 "helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall" and now opposes Trump's $5 billion request for a border wall "just because he's a Republican."  There are numerous factual errors here: there was no border barrier deal in 2014. A 2013 legislative package proposed $8 billion for border fencing ‚Äî not $25 billion for a border wall.  More importantly, the border fencing Schumer backed in 2013 is different than how Trump has described his border wall. And the meme glosses over Schumer‚Äôs previous support for border wall funding earlier this year, in exchange for protections for Dreamers.  We rate this post False.‚Äù

because they never spoke about walls, they spoke about fences or other physical barriers on several locations where needed
Tedi Lockmiller unfortunately most in Congress are millionaires and their congressional salaries are a drop in the bucket to them.
Becky Geyer Price actually, it should very much matter. Let's see... If attachments that spent taxpayer money on abhorrent things were attached, I would not sign it either. And believe me, there's plenty of crap attached to budget bills.

Joni Preuss  everything they do will backfire tonight, Pres Trump will gain the trust of the American people in those 8 mins on prime time. I say let them failed and say what they have to say bc the American people do not want to be put on a back burner and the liberal leaders have not learn this lesson still since the lost of  the election. hate and bitterness and scare tactics rule their party that split 3 ways.. I ran as well entire family did along with 250,000 people in northeastern P.A. and that is only part of P.a.
Lisa Palmer Fleming.   YOU WANT PESOS ???  AMERICA NEEDS TO QUIT PAYING AND GIVING A FREE RIDE TO EVERY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.  PERIOD !!!!   IT'S A SHAME AMERICAN CITIZENS INCLUDING ELDERLY, WOMEN, CHILDREN & VETERANS ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS OR TURNED DOWN FOR SERVICES, BUT A ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT GETS A FREE RIDE AND EVERYTHING ON OUR TAX DOLLARS.    IF THEY CAN'T DO IT LEGALLY THEY DON'T DESERVE TO BE HERE.  SO YES, STOP LETTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BLEED THE SYSTEM DRY AND THERE WILL BE MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THE WALL.   AND ANOTHER ANSWER.  WHY WAS OTHER COUNTRY'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM ???   RULES, REGULATIONS AND HAVE TO EARN THEIR OWN WAY.

Barbara Burleigh See Yes Barb I have! You need your birth certificate & a photo I.D. or a passport! And I never saw a wall! Don‚Äôt forget Barb that I am from the same town that you are from! I really don‚Äôt recall many illegal immigrants walking around Titusville!
He will, by the trade deal he got with them.. and it will pay for itself when we stop paying for illegals to live here.
We have to build the wall to find out who's paying for it.
Abby Schmidt The Immigrants....in the town might be different in todays world there.     Just seeing and saying.....
Robert Malik Well explain how his wall is going to get built with his new trade deals when they haven‚Äôt even been approved by Congress yet?
Abby Schmidt who cares who pays for it I don‚Äôt all I know to many Americans have lost so much due to the illegal immigrants that have know right to be here invading our country and our security the has to build the wall
You All Listen To Fake News. Try real researching.  Trump @020 The Greatest President We Had for Years. Its Been In A Great Mess Till President Trump Came Along.Thank God For Him Trump 2020.
Wendy Long this will back fire on the democrats like everything they do. the American people  indeed walk with common sense and as well could discern the truth. Democrat leaders fear you could sense it and feel it abundantly. well I could probably many other do as well.
Katie Mercado How can something be mine if it doesn‚Äôt exist? Lady!
Robert Malik Well isn‚Äôt that what your dear leader told you at all of his hate rallies? Didn‚Äôt Mexico say that they were not going to pay for any wall right from the start? I am not against border security, but didn‚Äôt you republicans have 2 years to get this wall done? What happened? How is a wall going to stop terrorists like the ones on 9/11? You do realize that they have caught more people that are on ‚Äúsuspected terrorists list‚Äù coming in from the Canadian border don‚Äôt you? Are we going to build a wall between us & Canada also? Where is the caravan that was supposed to show up in November? They magically vanished!
How many money do you need to build the wall lady??   üòÇü§£
Dale Frost, name one politician that's not lied to us? It shouldn't matter how it gets paid for as long as it gets built.
So he never said that Mexico was going to pay for his wall? Were all of hate rallies that he screamed it at was fake news?
Dale Frost, name one politician that's not lied to us? It shouldn't matter how it gets paid for as long as it gets built.
Abby Schmidt they will with all the lost cartel revenue you Idiot
Robert Malik Really? Mexico already said 2 years ago that they would not pay for any wall!  He promised you that Mexico was going to pay for it! What happened to that? By the way I have done a very good job at keeping my family safe for the last 44 years & I didn‚Äôt need a wall to do it! Get it,Got it?

Greg Merz YOU SHOULD TRY RUSSIAN VODKA & CRANBERRY
Jason Reger explain to me how you got into this country if you are not native american?
Abby Schmidt Nobody cares  any more it has become to dangerous.    between the gangs , ISSI , the illnesses a lot of which are fatal & the rapist, Drunks, & Drugs coming through the borders its time to close them.  lord forbid  one of them should kill one of your family members. then you would understand. I raised my kids on my own.  i got welfare for 6 months i took a cut in pay to get off it. it was not designed to be a way of life. Kids now get pregnant now so the Tax payers have to pay for their kids .  if you can't afford to buy insurance then don't have kids.  when they are raised on it they don't even try to get off it, we don't owe other people a living especially from other countries that is communism go to Cuba  Russia North Korea ,  they are starving ,  if your sickly, disabled or old they let you die.  your only allowed 2 kids in China & Japan.  if you get a job your paying for others medicine, housing, food, How do you want to live just getting by or have a chance to have nice things, travel give your kids nice clothes , take them out to eat. afford a safe place for them while your at work. the rich democrats who all voted for the wall before Trump won are not going to give you anything. they all have wall, gates, armed body guards. & they would have you arrested if you dared to come near them
Abby Schmidt üòÇü§£üòÇüëénever ever.  Dump Donald must pay
Abby Schmidt they are indirectly through tariffs.
Abby Schmidt  I don‚Äôt think Mexican pay for the wall ..we need to pay üòû taxes


Jason Reger a lot of people care! He was very loud and aggressive he would see to it that it wouldn't cost the US a dime! That seems to have totally been forgotten by some.
Jennifer Cromwell Well he lied & if you tell people that you get attacked!
Abby Schmidt üòÇü§£üòÇüëénever ever.  Dump Donald must pay
Kinda stupid everyone is chewing this girl out, if anyone remembers the basis for Trumps campaign was were gonna build a wall and Mexico will pay for it, now I'm all for the wall and i knew when he was running that Mexico wasn't going to pay, I personally want the wall but him shutting down the government and using Federal workers as ponds to get what he wants is kinda sad, we already have 2 prisons taken over by the National Guard because they have no staff due to this shutdown. He wont get his way unless he declares a state of emergency, which is what I want I wish he would go ahead and do it so families can have money flow back. Dont hate on me because I proved a point and you dislike my opinion, try having a father who works for the Federal govement and who doesnt know when his next check will come. This is damaging the Federal Govement not helping.
Only a moron would believe Mexico would pay for a wall. But then again, if you think Trump is good for America, describing you as a moron is far too kind ;)
Michael Hill what does that mean?
Jennifer Cromwell Well he lied & if you tell people that you get attacked!
Dorothy Dawson-Spencer LMAO I don't get free handouts, I work for EVERYTHING I have ...Trump is a dick and not fit for presidency...
Keith Hamilton , finally someone who gets it!!
build the Wall do not back down
Lillian Weisberg it's **you're**.. But your president is immature and he will put everyone in a recession, including your dumbass !!!
Abby Schmidt wah wah shut up dumb dumb
Tonya Justice Sweetie how do you figure? I am almost 62 years old , I got a job 3 days after I turned 18! Never received anything from welfare you ignorant ass! My husband has worked the same job for 31 years for the state! I am a welfare mooch ? Sit the fu*k down honey!
Here we go another one that does not understand 5.6 billion verses 200+billion every year on illegals it‚Äôs just plain dumb the tariff will pay for it in the long run but the money we will save in illegals as well as diseases and outbreaks along with drugs is enough alone some people‚Äôs reaction just plain dumb
Michael Hill and they sure as hell won't.

Oscar Olszewski didn‚Äôt vote for either. Had an acquaintance who went to a farenthold event and was shocked at his level of ‚Äúpartying‚Äù. And McQueen was in and out very quickly and abruptly and during Hurricane Harvey no less. No respect for either. What I realized was that politicians are useless. No matter what their affiliation. Some do good, some do bad and some are really bad. So we are forced to accept levels of ‚Äúacceptable corruption‚Äù. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found down here.
Sherry Carruth you are forgetting the influx of revenue from the new trade deal with Mexico.
Medea Helsel here in San Diego also. You can always tell who hasn't been effected by illegals or don't live in a border town. RIGHT?

Oscar Olszewski in addition to that, this city is run on favors and promises. They keep raising our taxes, say they‚Äôll fix things then they never do. The city infrastructure itself is crumbling. Streets are awful, crime is up, they want to cut fire and police pay. Meanwhile....our taxes keep getting increased with no results. It‚Äôs nuts down here.

If Trump and his Cult want the Wall so bad bad then they should step up to the plate and pay for it!!!........do not burden We The People with your DAMN OBSESSION!!!
Jeff Rockwell these are the same polls that made the crooked president on the 8th of Nov 2016
Joseph Saab If trump had kept his promise he wouldn‚Äôt need the American taxpayers money, he would have collected the funds from Mexico, he hasn‚Äôt. He needs to keep that promise Joseph
Ann de Roo-Daly he already did with nafta....
Ann de Roo-Daly  also he can do extremely well if he stops the benefits for illegals welfare, housing, medical, education...these benefits open the door for more to come...I want them to apply legally and wait their turn...think about it.
Patti Vargas I have both, but thank you for your concern. In addition to those, I have beliefs, morals and resolve. But thanks again.

Do you support stealing from those who have earned it? I don‚Äôt understand. Stealing is stealing no matter how you do it and stealing is wrong
Victoria Hall Davids libtards are so uneducated
Rita Abrahamson where are you getting your information?
Victoria Hall Davids YES! INFRASTRUCTURE. It is crumbling all around us.  Roads suck. Bridges are badly in need of repairs and we want to waste money. Go visit Buffalo.  Half the roads feel like they were bombed.
Christopher are you really that stupid. Research before you think you understand. Please Google who is responsible for road repairs lmao
Victoria Hall Davids why not both? We can fix the system for the ones looking to work to make a better life for themselves and make a barrier to stop the ones just looking to live off the system/sling drugs/flee prosecution.
Christopher Meadwell pretty sure the infrastructure issues in NY are more of a "state is run by absolute assholes" issue than a federal one. Emperor Cuomo needs his campaign money!
Christopher Meadwell THAT should have been taken care of years ago. You know with some of the Presidents in the past....
New York's infrastructure issues, like California's, stem from decades of failed Democrat policies.
Victoria Hall Davids maybe we can sprinkle fairy dust on the border ...and then we can all frolic together... in the fields ...with butterflies! Daw!üòÇ

Glenn Maling someone with a brain that doesn‚Äôt listen to Fox News!
Hope Lester Weston you are so wrong, border patrol agents do not want a wall!
Mike Neary reworking immigration policies is not the same as banning guns...however, adding new walls is most definitely like banning guns, and as you already stated, people will find a way.    There are reasons why certain sections remain open...and obviously we will always have a budget to repair/replace those that are already there.  A more advanced system is what is needed..perhaps even hire more border patrol along these sections.    We have illegals coming in from other means and they eventually take our high paying jobs from Americans.  This is something no one is even discussing.  I've seen this happen myself, and it's far easier by plane.    I don't understand why we cannot have a new system at eh airports where tourists are registered into the system....make sure they have a return flight ticket...make sure they show where they will be staying (hotel reservations helps), monitor college students making sure they do not stay continue to stay once they have graduated
Hope Lester Weston You really think those four CBP agent Trump put in front of a microphone speak for the entire CBP? They don‚Äôt.
Victoria Hall Davids you dont understand how tax cuts on the wealthy help the poor people do you..
Victoria Hall Davids maybe we can sprinkle fairy dust on the border ...and then we can all frolic together... in the fields ...with butterflies! Daw!üòÇ
you dont live near the boarder,, where these fucking illegals , steel anything they can get their hands on..break into your house..or your car,cause damage to the towns near by..and the insurance companies keep raising their rates for every claim you make...just to mention the little things they do
And who are you?
Reworking immigration policies?  This is not different than banning guns.  Bad people will always find a way to have guns.  Reworking the immigration policies doesn‚Äôt do anything for the illegals.  Having a wall creates a funnel that limits the influx to specifically controlled areas.   Many people support affordable healthcare but what we have now isn‚Äôt affordable.  I don‚Äôt support a balanced budget.  I support a budget that has us bringing in more than goes out.  Stop sending money to undeserving countries for no reason.  Every broke person in the world doesn‚Äôt support tax cuts for the wealthy.  I don‚Äôt support them but I do recognize that certain taxes, like business income tax, must remain low so we can generate jobs and keep the jobs in this country.  We all support infrastructure spending so let‚Äôs stop spending 150B on illegals each year and build a wall for 5B so we can save 100B.  We then can use that money for infrastructure.

Second, at this point we're pretty much just watching a spoiled brat throwing a temper tantrum because he can't have his way, and he's screaming bloody murder about it because he knows his reputation is not only in the crapper, but is on it's last swirl before the drain.  Sure, we all know politicians are liars, but Trump was supposed to be the antithesis of "politician", and now here we are with the greatest pathological liar in human record sitting in the White House. :-/  I mean honestly, do YOU see Mexico paying for the wall?

I do agree with you there does seem to be a sense of immaturity in the White House, but that of course has nothing to do with the Democrats. They are opposing trump‚Äôs willingness to squander Americans hard earned taxes. trump has promised the Mexicans would fund his wall, so why does he need the Democrats to approve? Makes no sense at all.

You don‚Äôt build walls because you hate the people on the outside, you build walls because you love the people on the inside. ‚ù§Ô∏è BUILD THE WALL!!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
What a ridiculous statement by Godfrey.   All the people in our country killed by illegals is something to be taken very seriously.   Those are the facts.     I pity a person who believes any of the lies that the Democrats push.   They are the ones who are truely sick people.   They want to protect a criminal over a decent, good American citizen.   There is something very sinister about their agenda.   It is an agenda of power....all power....absolute power corrupts.   Communists is what they have turned into.  The  old Democrat party of Kennedy is dead.
Jason N Gabriel cause I can
Mitchell James lol didn‚Äôt bother looking did you
Cindy Ann Godfrey, your a special.kind of DUMB
Eva Wallace if it gets built will count how many times he praises himself it a shame ppl lol don't understand do you console liars first it was Mexico wil pay for wall and I heard all cheering Mexico pay for wall then it was I (trump) will pay for it with my own money  now ? It's the ppl will pay for wall US ! What don't you get 5.7 million dollars how hard is that to understand ! the point !
Cindy Ann Godfrey do you have children and grandchildren?
BUILDING WALL and watched the snowflakes melt.

You don‚Äôt build walls because you hate the people on the outside, you build walls because you love the people on the inside. ‚ù§Ô∏è BUILD THE WALL!!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Amanda Bell how grown up you act lol

It would cost a lot less money to put his draft dodging Grandfathers name on the monument at Ellis Island! ;-)
Jill, straight up..yes..based simply on the fact that I do research on the topic at hand..actual research not simply listening to Fox and calling that research.
Jill Travassos Just because you can shout at people doesn't mean they'll listen to you. :-|
You are a liar!  Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall, not the US taxpayer. TSA workers who aren‚Äôt getting paid are starting not to show up, putting our aviation industry in danger. The workers need to feed their families. Trump said ‚ÄúI can relate to federal workers not getting paid‚Äù. Lol! This from a guy who inherited millions of dollars from his dad. Tell that to the CBP officer who can‚Äôt pay rent. Trump has never had to pay rent or make a car payment. Those USSS agents that guard Trump and put their lives on the line everyday are working for free as is the Coast Guard and more! Trump could care less! This is a crisis caused by the liar in the WH and a GOP that is spineless.
Delusional

Micheal, that's a good one.  Typical snowflake trump supporter.  You come to the discussion with no facts or information just verbal attacks...so very much like Trump you are in that way.

Common sense says ya gotta protect your perimeter just like you naturally do or wanna do at your home. Maybe need to let them know that they are straight up missing some chromosomes and don't need to be involved with making decisions in regards to security period, ya know.
Many people would cry if it was laid out that blunt and direct, but somebody probably gonna have to do it sooner or later. Wow, this is crazy..........
MARK.  SO YOU THINK KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS SITUATION THAN THE PRESIDENT AND THE BORDER PATROL?  BLESS YOUR HEART. ;)

Diane Mathieu you might think this is about defeating trump, but that is not the case. trump could have had his wall built already. He had both houses and two years time to do it. What stopped him? It‚Äôs clear he never had the backing, not from congress and not from the Republican party, but now he wants the Democrats to back the plan his own party wouldn‚Äôt. That is ridiculous!

Yay, another intelligent American !!!  My message to Donald Trump:  ‚ÄúSure, border security !!! But that does not necessarily mean a 5 billion dollar wall !!! The Democrats also want border security ... but not the 5 billion dollar wall that you are proposing for border security !!! You need to learn how to negotiate and compromise !!! You are used to bullying until you get your own way !!! You have no respect or consideration for the other people with whom you are negotiating !!! You are 71 but you act like a child who hasn‚Äôt learned that he cannot always have his own way !!! You need to grow up !!! I hope the Democrats don‚Äôt let you get away with your bullying ways so that you may learn how to be a mature individual !!!

Jerry Risner Exactly and that there is good old fashion common sense folks .üëè
Jerry Risner with both houses of congress since trump took office two years ago, he couldn‚Äôt get the wall funded. Could that be because he lied about Mexico paying for it? How many times was he filmed saying that? Who knows, but he had his chance and blew it

Look back to Chuck saying, before any name was mentioned for Supreme Court said Dems would not vote to confirm. They made fools, during the hearing, of themselves. Remember we now need 60 votes in Senate to pass anything further.  Chuck said No Way do Dems vote yes to anything!!   üò°üò°üò°üò°

Did anyone see Schumer in the rebuttal?  I'm pretty sure his homosapian costume was loose in a few places revealing his repulsive reptile scales.
Deb Lilred Arrowood illegals verses what $$$ towards helping our own citizens first.  And the Democrats have the nerve to request more $$$ for foreign aid than what is already being allocated but no concern towards the safety and security of the citizens they took a oath to serve and protect.  Whatever,  some sheep keep their blinders on.
Yes we need a border! Thank you to our President to continue his very intelligent process. We support you and lets get this done! Protect and Defend! Finally we have a good leader in office lets support our President Donald J. Trump!

Arev Neerg... Just the opposite. Trump is far from acting like a child !! The real children are Pelosi and Schumer, refusing to do the adult thing and negotiate a deal. They don't want to budge. Pelosi saying she would only give a dollar? They can't see past their bitterness and hatred to put something on the table. This is not Trump acting like a child, it's the left using the wall against Trump and holding Americans hostage with their refusal to work with our President because it would enterfere with their political agenda,  shame on them!!
Pelosi slurs and can't even talk right. So what diagnosis do you give her?

Barbara Balding Garlic it's a 3-prong approach. It's strategically placed and not coast to coast so why can't you compromise on it?
Kory Sutherland do you kiss your boyfriend with that mouth. Funny how you can pretty much already know what a snowflake is like before even having to look at their profile.
Barbara Balding Garlic are you that stupid. How many people who own that land do you think would complain about a wall when  people are coming through and shitting on there land leaving trash and even die on that land because of lack of preparation for the long trip. There is also a thing called imminent domain.

Sherry Carruth The caravan is costing Tijuana $30k/month! Yes if they don't come here, Mexico pays. Illegals cost us well over $150 billion a year! That's the wall plus homes for American homeless, job training for those on welfare and 100s of animal shelters, a million pounds of plastic out of the oceans and more in the next few years! Think how much it will save us and what we could do with that $
Sherry Carruth consider this. The money we will not have to spend to take care of illegals would pay for the wall in only a few years.

The Democrats  don't  stand for America, but for foreign countries  obviously.  Their policies are not for building a better America,  but their aim is headed for SOCIALISM GOVERNMENT controlling your lifestyle.  American people must fight to keep your nation from dictatorship.  Freedom is solidarity  and we must fight to keep America for our children and grandchildren to experience  without dictatorship a hardship they don't  need to experience.

It appears to all Americans that Democrats care more for illegal aliens and foreign countries and they do for American citizens. Keep going Donald you‚Äôre doing a great job.

Donna Barnes, Are you really trying to compare a home privacy fence or wall with a 2,000 mile 30‚Äô wall that‚Äôs supposed to secure our borders ? Besides the fact that Obama does not have a wall around his home it would not stop serious criminals nor would Trumps wall. The wall around the Vatican was built in  the year 848, over 1,150 years ago. Probably was the latest technology at the time. Very silly and childish comparisons.
Tony Stewart the wall structure in the area where the most problems are is 423 miles. The wall in question is not the whole length of the border.
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you just a durp durp dur dur durrrrrrrrrpppp!!!üêùüêùüêùüêùüêùüêùüêùüêùbuzzzzzz!!!!
Donna Rinerr, Great then tell Trump his Great Wall is only 423 miles long because that is not what he is saying.
thanks for posting a book
Donna Rinerr, Great then tell Trump his Great Wall is only 423 miles long because that is not what he is saying.
Tony Stewart you‚Äôre confusing them with facts! tRump supporters have a problem with facts!
Trump says he is told a lot of things that aren‚Äôt true. Trump said his predecessors told him they supported his wall and all said they had no discussions with Trump about the wall and none support the building of a wall. So we can hardly believe Trump when he says border control agents want a wall or think it would work.
In 2013 the Dems voted to give $46 billion to secure the borders!! Why not now? It‚Äôs time to Stop the crime
Etta Ejg Moss then why didn't he do it at any point over the last two YEARS when Republicans had FULL control?
Heather Love Leffel Durp durp durp durp dur dur dur durp durrrrrrrrrpppp!!!üêùüêùüêùüêùüêùüêùüêùüêùüêù!!! Buzzzzzzzzz!!!!
Heather Love Leffel that is a silly statement
Heather Love Leffel if we can not afford to throw 5 billion at a wall how come we can spend 54 billion on foreign aid?
In 2013 the Dems voted to give $46 billion to secure the borders!! Why not now? It‚Äôs time to Stop the crime
Michelle Breen then why didn't it happen when Republicans had full control?  Why wait until Dems take over KNOWING we aren't going to sign off on wasting 5 BILLION dollars on a ineffective wall?  Please explain
Republicans could have passed it the first week Trump took office......or anytime over the past two years without needing Dem support.
Wayne Denny absolutely
Jason Gardner would you like to answer the question then? Why wasn't it don't while Republicans had control of literally EVERYTHING? Why wait to fight Dems over it and shutdown the government?
Heather Love Leffel <- democrat slave troll, ignorant of how stupid they sound even when it is explained to them. The democrats will lose the house and fail to get senate, the republican majority will likely be large enough to destroy any filibuster, democrats will lose everything :) And there is nothing you can do about it. Illegals will be sent back, they will be forced to compete with the homeless and when they show up either dead from self defense when they try to rob a citizen or arrested they will get justice, the countries they came from will also be left to die as nature intended. And if you want to use the "European settler" defense, ask the Spanish who birthed the Mexican ethnicity what they did to the natives of literally half of america, all of central America and half of south America and the over 10 million African slaves they brought over, as American had merely 300k, how did mexico become such a shitty country? What is your excuse for these people who descended from soldiers who raped and murdered native people?

Rodney Martin we are not against better than we currently have. Walls are proven not to work, it's a fact, it would be a waste of billions of dollars then we would still have to enact other saftey precautions later. No need to waste that money! We have and will give funds to basically any other form of border security.....just not a giant wasteful ineffective wall.  I have been a democrat all my adult life and have only met ONE democrat who actually wanted open borders. To say we want open borders is false and used to create division and fear.
Rodney Martin because that is basically like taking 5 BILLION dollars and catching it on fire. We have homeless vets, hungry children, crumbling infrastructure.....this is not a time to waste that kind of money. Also, I appreciate you having a civil conversation about it with me. I enjoy speaking with adults who act like adults.
We do want a wall

Drunk driving with stolen identities. Makes me sick!! Our people legal citizens come first.
And ironically, it was only a promise because his campaign staff considered him too scatterbrained to remember his immigration talking points, so they gave him a one syllable word he could use.  It was only when the crowd cheered that he decided to make it a campaign feature and a promise.

Here in California Democrats want to give free medical to illegal aliens instead of helping the homeless, Veterans and the American people. They are not for Americans but for those who are not Americans. I also hope the US AG will get involved and arrest them as well for aiding them.

Mike Bowers please, explain to us all in detail how Mexico will pay.
Kim Miller you're right they would laugh at us if we close the border, because they already have all our big companies there. We lost thousands of jobs to Mexico so let's give the rest of them to Mexico too.

I'll donate my tax return to the wall, just get it built!
Bob, I am concerned about this too, that is why my comments are about working together, not digging in our heels, not blaming one or the other, and I have commented on the unfair furloughing of government employees who need their paychecks.  They are doing their jobs and have families to support and are stressed and need the light at the end of the tunnel.  I wish we could get back to respect and sit down for the good of the country, no one being all right or all wrong.

Obama says ‚Äúthings are going to get worse‚Äù. Why do Dems think record jobs, tax cuts, great economy, people thriving...are ‚Äúgetting worse‚Äù?  Can they define what they think is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù?   We hear Dems say they want everything Trump is doing or trying to do, including transparency, but they resist it all!  Can they define their ‚Äúbetter‚Äù in detail? I‚Äôm tired of hearing the generic claims and want details.  I want transparency and know who paid people off with tax dollars.  I want to know how and from where their wealth is coming from.  I want THEIR tax returns.  Open borders = trafficking = slavery = $$$$$$$$$$$$$.  Dems are fighting for open borders = trafficking = slavery = $$$$$$$$$$.
If he resigns bet he gets an even bigger thank you :-)

...then fund the full $25B and come up with a better solution. All the democrats do is refuse... no better solutions or money.  They were all for it when Obama was in office. Stupid politics plain and simple!
Well, well, well...remember the 2010 Southwest Border Security Bill that obama signed?...                                                                            "The President signed into law a comprehensive plan to secure the Southwest border, including $600 million in supplemental funds for enhanced border protection and law enforcement activities, offset by cancelling $100 million from the SBInet program within DHS. Though not specifically provided in this bill, the President has also authorized the deployment of up to an additional, requirements-based 1,200 National Guard troops to the border, a deployment that has already begun."    I guess the Dims just sat on their thumbs and did nothing once again to secure our safety.

This a reps job to make a mess bring in the dems for a whileblame then for their inability to clear up yearsbeyond years of rep damages and get played as the puppet for the chaos so a rep can stand back in and act like a hero so fucking abusive man

After your speech I donated to your "Official Secure the Border Fund"!! Thank you for putting American citizens first!! I noticed that nancy peolsi's little speech was still putting non-citizens ahead of the safety and security of Americans.
We don't need any more voters, we are the majority right now you pin head
John Decker Sure, if you count all of the dead people voting.

All the Dems, are telling Nancy Pelosi to say no to the border. You can tell she is Coached.
No they didn‚Äôt.
Good luck Mr President, by the way on Feb 12, 2013 obamas state of the Union talked about his belief in security at the border. And on 5/25/10 Obama also ordered 1,200 National Guard troops to the border. On Sept. 29, 2006 U.S. Senat confirmed law HR 6061 authorizing and partially funding construction of 700 miles of physical fence , barriers at the border. Secure fence act of 2006. Public law 109-367.
Alison Reeder seriously. That is a negotiating tactic with Mexico. It is cost effective and will pay for itself with less people to process.

Amy McWeiss Your so ignorant and sound like a FOOL..GO AWAY TROLL
Amy McWeiss fear mongering.
Trump hates all average Americans, has zero empathy for the working class American.  Trump thinks Fed workers are Dems so he can screw them. Trump is supposed to be the Pres of the US, not Fox News! Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall, not the US taxpayer. TSA workers who aren‚Äôt getting paid are starting not to show up, putting our aviation industry in danger. FDA workers aren‚Äôt showing up to inspect our food. The workers need to feed their families. Trump said ‚ÄúI can relate to federal workers not getting paid‚Äù. Lol! This from a guy who inherited millions of dollars from his dad. Trump has never had to pay rent or make a car payment, he‚Äôs clueless and amoral. Trump is crap!

Elaine Herrmann he had to get the Economy and the Military rebuilt first
And they didn‚Äôt have time to pass legislation in TWO YEARS to secure our borders? That‚Äôs was one of his first promises.  Think about it,  TWO YEARS and nothing standing in his way.  He could have had a slam dunk, a done deal. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that important to him.
Don't you remember him trying to get wall funding and they kept saying 'we will work on immigration reform' ? But they WILL NOT get it done. He's sick of it...shut it down. Even on tv tonight they said 'we will work on it...'  NO...TIME IS UP
It‚Äôs called governing and part of that is compromising for the Greater Good. The Left wanted DACA, the Right wanted the Wall.  Time for them to go to work. Listen to the other side they‚Äôre not ALL crazy and they just may have valid points. Listen to Learn not Argue.  We all want the same outcome, a safe country, why would  we not?
Elaine Herrmann ok so why won't they back him now ?  If they supported it then they should still support it.  They need to give up and let him do what needs to be done
Melissa Eads Parker let's face it former Speaker Paul Ryan and Mitc McConnell are where the blame should be placed
Tim Finch no the entire Party is responsible. They could have had it but they waited ( for what?) Now they have a great excuse Not to, Don‚Äôt have the votes anymore.  They are playing us.

The wall has been a no brainer since before recorded time. How about exposing who profits from not having a border wall since drug deaths, human trafficking and cost dont seem to make the people understand common sense.
Martin Sr.-- Sure, there is a high structure up by the ports of entry but there is only falling down 5 foot wire fencing across miles after that. And miles of NO fences, where evil people can sneak in. I've watched the documentation's of it. You need to get more informed about this subject.

Once the wall is up and the opiate supply is sharply reduced, the epidemic will drastically improve. You will 100% own that huge accomplishment that impacts people of all walks and party affiliation. Big win in 2020
your paranoia and bigotry are showing.
Rick Sooy His promise was that MEXICO would pay for it!
It's ashame you feel that way, we as Americans have seen too much crap thrown at us for so long people can no longer see straight. I'm in fear for my kids and everyone else's. And bigotry has nothing to due with my feelings. John Decker answer this please - Bigotry, If someone is accused of bigotry then the accusing party must also be intolerant of the accused persons intolerance; therefore, it is self evident that the term bigot in a sense, can not actually exist in a free society or open debate because of it's self-destructive, self-imploding and hypocritical nature.
Josh your right, but this is no longer about money. The one side hates the other side and will do what ever is needed to destroy our POTUS. Like it or not he's our leader, he beat 16 Republicans and Hillary to get this position. Like it or not, Trump won.

Where is he bankrupting us. just because he wants to spend and make thing right. look at the debt Obama left us.
I'll bet that if President Trump says that building the wall is stupid and we should invite as many Illegals in as we can hold. The Dems would build the wall for less than the proposed 5 billion dollars.

Aside from it being a common sense approach to an ongoing issue of illegal immigration and a deterrent,  the cost is the same as a handful of military planes (of which we have hundreds and hundreds) there‚Äôs also the added benefit of American jobs for American citizens... I don‚Äôt see the downside at all.    Frankly I‚Äôd much rather spend my tax dollars on walls, roads, and infrastructure than federally funded abortion programs and aid to countries that can‚Äôt get their act together.  Why Democrats are opposed when their very leadership just a handful of years ago were in support of the same actions is beyond me.    Whether you like this president or not, national security is the only real function of the government that means anything to me, and therefore you have my complete support!  When you‚Äôre done with this, let‚Äôs put the same amount of money into cyber security.  You‚Äôll have my full support there too.    America First!

I called Pelosi‚Äôs Office & left her  a message to build the Wall & give this President the money.  This woman, Nancy has a Vendetta against this President along with the whole  Democratic Party. I cannot believe the Disrespect of a head of the  Country like this  Party is doing to this President And Us Citizens who support him and his Agenda for America.  We pay this Congress, so instead of hurting the people who are not getting a paycheck, change that status & hold Congresses pay instead?  I find that the best solution, and you would see them wanting to settle & build the wall. Even with their crooked Billions they have by using our money for their own gain.  What if we refused to quit paying any Taxes.  I think we are better off without Government!!!
üó£Mr President, you are wasting time waiting for your democrat enemies to fund the Wall.  They won‚Äôt!!!

(202)225-4965 In San Francisco (415)556-4862  Chuck Schumer in Washington DC (202)224-6542.  or FAX (202)228-3027  I don't have a fax machine but wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a whole room full of paper in his office tomorrow? If you call and leave a message try to be civil but aggressively push 4 a barrier at our Southern border. Thank you
Democrats want America to FAIL because they hate Trump and All the people that voted for him and the end of the SLOW movement of congress.    Democrats Love Illegals and open Borders more than helping and working for America and AMERICANS.    End the hate filled liberal Democrat and vote the Democrats that HATE America out of office.
We need to extend that wall right up the California border.
I always voted for the most qualified candidate for political office. I promise I will never vote for another Democrat again in my lifetime. Never üêΩüëé
I'm curious if 3 years ago, if I had said that conservatives, in this nation, would advocate the seizure of private land by the federal government, you would have called me crazy. If I had said that the government, without a real plan, would propose an inflated building project with no outline regarding overall cost, material, budgeting for upkeep or added security, and that conservatives would gladly throw money at it, you would call me crazy. And if I had said it was liberals who were advocating responsible federal funding, you would have called me crazy.
Why waste money on a wall when they'll just tunnel under it?  Spend the money on our veterans instead!!!

It‚Äôs mind boggling how their supporters know they wanted and funded a wall, yet they bash the president for wanting the same.
You know with education ignorant can be cured but your kind of stupid is for life.

I‚Äôm getting tired hearing about this wall.  FYI. We don‚Äôt need a Wall it‚Äôs impossible where trump wants to be build. N who‚Äôs going to pay for n I know Mexico not paying for it.  Trump is lying to you  no-not many is entering in the United States illegally. Where‚Äôs the proof of that?  Look it up research it.  A wall won‚Äôt fix immigration problems etc.
How about Trump agreeing to open the government if the democrats agree to an election that let's the American people decide on a wall or not?
In an article that appeared Tuesday on Just Security, a website about national security and the law, Nicholas Rasmussen decimated Trump‚Äôs argument for a border wall ‚Äî and made it known he thought the president and others in the administration are lying about the extent of a crisis.  ‚ÄúThere is no wave of terrorist operatives waiting to cross overland into the United States. It simply isn‚Äôt true,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAnyone in authority using this argument to bolster support for building the wall or any other physical barrier along the southern border is most likely guilty of fear mongering and willfully misleading the American people.‚Äù
You should open up with clips of Schumer, Obama, Clinton, Pelosi demanding border security and funding for a wall.  Go...

Build that wall Mr President we support you
Democrats are so hell bent on trying to make Trump fail but what are they doing in return to make this country better? Right now, absolutely nothing. Don't blame Trump for the shutdown. Blame the House for not passing a bill that will not pass the Senate.  Turnabout is fair play. The democrats refused to make the necessary votes to pass a bill that the House (when republicans had the House) and now the Senate republicans are saying "No". Kinda sucks when the other teams is using your playbook against you.
President Trump and our team will WIN if we want it more than whining Democrats.  We will see. Republican establishment types usually FOLD.
President Trump is serious about fulfilling his campaign promises . While democrats are playing petty politics with our nations security our President is doing whatever it takes to protect our borders. Contrary to bogus political talk saying he wants the wall to keep out black and brown people whom he does not like, the truth is as President of the United States of America it is his duty to protect and defend our country from illegal immigrants.
Build that wall Mr President we support you
The Dems aren‚Äôt stopping him. They offered another $1.6 billion and he turned it down. The original $1.6 billion from 2017 still has not been spent. So this shutdown is ridiculous.
The Democrats want to see America destroyed to get back at the President.  Can‚Äôt the democrat & liberals see this?
Barbara Combs--The democrat's want democrat illegal votes & Trump gone. PERIOD!

How come it was decided to build the wall 30 years ago, the money was appropiated and the wall was built across CA but petered out near Arizona.. did the funds run out or was it decided that no man would cross the desert to get here, or was the money just squandered an run out??
Tony Carlos---Yes, Trump needs to have them unsealed soon but I'm sure he's waiting for the Mueller report to be finally finished.

Agreed, We pay tolls.
The dems only agenda is obstructing you, President Trump!  They are afraid the idiots who support the socialists will want to jump the democrat's dinghy and get onvthe yacht with you.
Agreed, We pay tolls.
David George, if I‚Äôm wrong, then we could save a ton of cash by restructuring all of the prisons in our Criminal Justice System to nothing but fences. And with that money we save, we could build more and more walls...You are brilliant, sir.
So our nation should be like a prison?
Well all we have to do is Ask other Country's that has Walls if they work , Israel said 98% of Suicide Booming's has Stopped Because of there Walls ‚Ä¶ Walls work ‚Ä¶ Come into the United States of America ALL IS WELCOME ‚Ä¶ Just come Legally . Keep America Safe  ‚Ä¶ Trump 2020

How to get Mexico to pay for the wall ? Charge a toll of one US dollar  pre person to drive or walk across the Border. A border wall is a matter of National Security Therefore allocate the money from the defense fund and get on with it. Charge a 19.65 peso toll at the border to drive into America... there you go! Mexico is well on its way to paying for the Wall!  According to Google, in 2017 2,016.42 people crossed into the united states using 16 pedestrian bridges. 350 million people drive into the United States with 330 ports of entry. I say Charge a Toll of $19.16 Pesos pre person... Wall Paid For!  Charge one US Dollar toll per person to drive or walk across into the U.S. at the border. Wall paid for!
Matthew Cloward ya I guess prison wall are just for looks  ‚Ä¶ ya right

I think the other reason is that there afraid of the radical fraction of the Democratic Party and possibly promises made To them to get there vote.  The other would be companies that don‚Äôt want to stop the flow of cheap labor.  And what do these same companies donate to there campaines .  How much is the speaker worth.

Two faced liberals...  The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico.  **Obama, Clinton, Schumer and 23 other Democratic senators voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19.**  Political politics Pelosi?   Every immigration bill she voted on since 1992,,, Was a NAY!  Sure she‚Äôs an American?   https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/26732/nancy-pelosi/40/immigration#.XDX_vKROmEc
For 2 years, Republicans had a majority in the House and the Senate. So tell me, why did they not vote to build the WALL?
THIS IS THE REAL TRUTH!!!!!   A thorough and thoughtful post regarding the cost, and impossible challenges of Trumps ‚Äúwall‚Äù.  Why it won‚Äôt happen, while still he will paralyze his country:   Please allow me to frame the issues involved with "the wall" in its actual terms. Despite what the media is saying, this is not about Democrat vs. Republican. In short, the executive branch of our government is threatening to declare a national emergency since the legislative branch will not authorize the seizure of private American property for a federal works project nor will fund it. The executive branch has already shut down the federal government. It is currently threatening to extend this government shut down for however long it takes for the legislative branch to cave.  Let us break this down.   First of all, the framework of our government is based on checks and balances. Power is divided into three branches: the Executive, the Legislative, and the Judicial. The Legislative branch controls the purse strings of government and creates laws. The Executive branch carries out those laws. The Judicial branch tells us whether the laws are constitutional or not. Each branch was designed to be able to balance the other branches.  Why? As shown by our original rebellion, Americans didn't want a King or a Dictator when we were setting up our government. We were not particularly thrilled with a House of Lords telling us what we could or could not do either.  In this case, the executive branch wants to: (1) take governmental cash,  (2) create its own law,  (3) take away private property from American citizens  (4) create its own federal works project.   At least three of these functions fall within the power/ responsibility of the legislative branch. So, what is the problem? This is one of the most naked power grabs by the executive branch over the others in recent history. Once that power is exercised, it is going to be difficult or impossible to regain any balance again. The executive branch was never meant to have that much power (see our country's previous concerns about Kings and Dictators). Is this constitutional? Very doubtful. Should all Americans be concerned? That is a question for you to answer yourself.   Second, a "National Emergency" is generally declared under these general conditions:  (1) Natural disasters including hurricanes, tornados, and earthquakes to name a few.  (2) Public health emergencies such as significant outbreaks of infectious diseases.  (3) Military attacks.  (4) Civil insurrection. (5) Any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy.  Now the first 4 aren't applicable. The last category was meant to be short-term only. It was designed to be reviewed by the legislative branch every year after it‚Äôs enacted (because again; the check and balance is fundamental to how we operate).  So, what is the problem here? If national emergencies can be declared by the executive branch for non-emergency purposes which vest power in one branch of the government why would that branch ever let go of that power again?  Third, the seizure of private property (known as ‚Äúeminent domain‚Äù, a body of law which says the government cannot just take your home without due process). You are joking, right? No. The US/Mexican border is 1,933 miles long. It runs through 4 states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas). Only 33% of that land is actually owned or managed by the Federal Government. A sizable percentage of that land is owned by the Indian nations. It is land preserved for those tribes by treaty and land given under treaty is not land owned by the United States. These tribes already have a lot of reasons to be angry at the Federal Government. This would be pouring additional gas on an open flame.  The other 64% of that land is privately owned.   How much land would have to be taken? The amount of land that the Federal Government would have to take would likely run 1,237 miles long to 12,371 miles deep (assuming a 1 to 10-mile DMZ from the border into the United States). Even if we could only take 100 to 500 ft of land in densely populated areas, that is a lot of private property that is going to be seized by the Federal government.   The land necessary for this project would also run through some highly populated areas in the US such as San Diego, Calexico, Nogales, El Paso, and Laredo. There will be a lot of Americans who are going to have their homes and businesses taken by the federal government. Which will also mean a lot of lawsuits.  In terms of the federal works project, these types of works include hospitals, bridges, highways, walls and dams. These projects may be funded by local, state, or federal appropriations. If they are federal, they are funded by the legislative branch of our government (the same branch that our executive branch is currently trying to take power from). Is the seizure of power constitutional? Not likely given the separation of powers discussed above.  Finally, these considerations do not take into account the sheer cost, human and monetary, that will be involved. The Department of Homeland Security estimates the current cost at $21 billion for construction alone (not counting costs of maintenance or costs associated with increased military/federal patrolling).   Ask yourself a simple question. When was the last time that you saw a governmental project brought in under time and under budget? Does anyone remember the ‚Äúbig dig‚Äù in Boston, Mass? The actual costs are likely to be much higher. This estimated cost also does not include compensating folks for taking their land or the associated impact upon their businesses.   The Federal budget deficit grew to $779 billion dollars in 2018 according to the Treasury Department. How are we, as a country, going to fund this project? How are we, as a country, going to deal with the additional debt? Unlike private businesses, our country cannot declare bankruptcy.   This is not about Democrat vs. Republican. It is not about who has the best zingers measured in 10 second sound bites. It is about our country. The core of this issue deals with the profound and immense changes the outcome will have on the structure of our nation. This is the way that we, as a country, should be framing these issues. Please think about it.  ~ Deb Narten

Keep egging and telling the Democrats and Republicans to suck it up and deal with the border wall.
A quick civics lesson:  Just before the government shutdown began, the Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (a Republican) overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill that would have kept the government open.  The then-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (a Republican) refused to allow the House to even vote on that bill knowing it would likely pass with a veto-proof majority.  For those who might not know, if a president vetoes a bill, if two-thirds of both the House and the Senate vote against that president‚Äôs veto, they can override it, thus enacting that bill.  That‚Äôs called ‚Äúchecks and balances,‚Äù a key component our Founding Fathers put into our Constitution.  Fast forward a few weeks to when Democrats took power in the House of Representatives. They passed essentially the same exact veto-proof bill the Senate had overwhelmingly approved just a couple of weeks earlier that would reopen the government.  Only now, the same Sen. McConnell who let the passage of that bill before, won‚Äôt allow the Senate to vote on it ‚Äî because he knows it would pass, thus forcing Trump to veto it, which would embarrass the party and expose their incompetence.  Keep in mind, this all centers around a lie Trump repeatedly told during his campaign (and even now) that Mexico was going to pay for his stupid wall, a wall he now wants the American taxpayer to fund.  Republicans controlled all of Congress and the White House for the past two years. If funding this wall was such a major issue, they would have done it ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt. Repeatedly, his own party refused to pass spending bills that gave Trump money for that pointless wall.  This isn‚Äôt about border security, no matter how many time Trump tells that lie. This is about his ego and his pathetic attempt to distract people from the constantly-growing list of scandals, legal troubles, and embarrassing administration departures he‚Äôs been dealing with over the last several weeks.  If our government was functioning how our Founding Fathers meant for it to, our government would have never shut down.  First it was a Republican, Paul Ryan, refusing to let the House vote on the bill the Senate passed. Now it‚Äôs hypocritical Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican, doing the same thing with the recently-passed House bill.  Two frauds who refused to allow a bill to be voted on to keep the government open/reopen it, not because they opposed it, but because they were afraid it would pass and embarrass their party‚Äôs ‚Äúpresident.‚Äù  This is not how democracy works. This is not how our government is supposed to work.  Donald Trump and the GOP are the only ones to blame for this political stunt.
LOL...I thought it was a beautiful and effective point in his address. We do not build walls because of hatred of those on the outside, but for the  love of those on the inside, I am over this WALL nonsense. They need to secure our borders. It is not a racial issue. They need to call it a Place of Entry. Every country deserves this.

That is your problem and Democrats. Hate rules common sense.  Federal workers on Furlough.....Do not give in.....Stand Strong Donald J. Trump Vets for Trump Why would you support someone not paying you.....hmmm.....That is because you are a true American and also served your country. Civilians have no concept of what freedom cost and want to whine about you or I not getting paid when in reality ,WE WILLINGLY go without pay because it is the right thing for the people and America first. We get our money back paid, they also do not know there are Emergency Relief funds available if you get bound up and need to get money, also when offered the job you sign a contract knowing you will work without pay if this happens. Americans want the freedoms United States provides as long as someone else is willing to provide them at no cost to them. They fear Gov. shutdown must be affecting their lives in some way because Democrats are telling them it is. Well it is, they are being led astray for open boarders, which is against our own countries laws to support. Another it is us We the people who care for the illegals. Our money , we earn for OUR Family is taken from us to care for them. The more that come into the country the more it cost and Democrats want more to come over 500,000. On average $18.00 a day per illegal in the country. In fact, illegal immigration costs taxpayers a staggering $134.9 billion a year while contributing only $19 billion in state, federal, and local taxes. At the federal level, medical costs make up the lion‚Äôs share of government expenditures on illegal immigrants, while education is the largest single expense that illegal immigration imposes on state and local governments. Sadly, an overloaded welfare state is not the only negative side-effect of our broken immigration system. Communities across America are also being devastated by the violent crime and drug trafficking that result from our failure to control the border ‚Äî an issue Donald Trump has addressed repeatedly and emphatically ever since he first announced his candidacy for president.Millions of dollars a day and more every day and Democrats say send them on,  our American Citizens will pay for more. Thank US the Democrat with your vote... Republicans did not want you. They wanted to put the American People FIRST. How RUDE...
The Democrats aren‚Äôt interested in protecting Americans do we Americans that want a safe country must come together to keep America safe and keep our freedom. I do believe the Democrats want Socialism.  Build the wall to keep people from entering our country illegally.
Donna Morton absolutely true!  It‚Äôs not about the border at all. It all about going against our President!

Thank you for having the courage to take a stand for our country, Mr President. I am a federal employee. The only congressman from my state who is keeping his paycheck is the democrat.
How can you be against border security of your own country. Do  You know how many levels of stupid the dems are with this.
Thank you for protecting our USA Mr President!!!!! Please don‚Äôt budge on building that wall.... America NEEDS the wall!!! I support you 100%!!!!!
Mr. President, I understand why you shut down the government, and I agree to a point. The problem is that the wrong people are being "punished" for the Democrats stubbornness. Instead of taking pay away from the military, postal service, and other people in necessary jobs, why not stop the pay for the Democrats in Congress, the Senate, and the House.? When their wallets are affected, I truly think we will see that wall go up in a hurry.  I appreciate all that you do for us. Thank you. President Trump in 2020!
Build the Wall! Don‚Äôt give in to the Dems. They do not stand for what Americans want! Keep the government shut down and call a National Emergency. We‚Äôre behind you!
If it isn't a priority then why did democrats vote for it when there was a Democrat president
Karen Harvey that's right, they have no intention of fixing the border they just want shutdown over. Stand your ground Mr President.
They just want to oppose for the sake of opposing even if it means a complete government shutdown for years.
Yes Dummy, we do want border security. Border security does not equal wall. Several other polls and research show that the people DO NOT WANT A WALL OR EVEN EXPANSION OF THE FENCING. It is pretty overwhelming too average of around 55% oppose the wall. Average of only 45% want the wall. But no please continue with the strawman arguments.

Jon Haugen , the $$$ comes from everyone.  We should have a say in how its spent.  Majority do NOT want a wall.  (And, yes, I lived in San Diego for years).  Far more effective, cost efficient ways to secure the border.
Lisa Stewart Fero obviously youve never had children in school there or had to go to the hospital there. Or pay taxes there.

Matt Walker  That would be awesome but there is too many unelected deep state big money greedy globalists sitting in DC that does not care one thing about anyone but themselves and how THEY want to see this country ran.
Then it is time to rise up, grow some balls like out founding fathers and remove them all, place them on trial and inprision everyone of them.  Sometimes it is just time to grow a pair and make a change.

Mr President   i voted for you to do what you are doing over border security    i want to ask you  when you reach an agreement with the democrats   that it INCLUDE A BONUS CHECK FOR ALL FEDERAL EMPLOYEES WHO ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THIS SHUTDOWN
How about giving the Dems their supreme Court nominee instead of the Republican game of obstruction. Work with us to work with you.
Trump, your ‚ÄúPROMISE‚Äù .. as stated by YOU many times: ‚ÄúMexico will pay for the Wall‚Äù!!  So, it‚Äôs not Dems preventing you from fulfilling your ‚ÄúPromise‚Äù, you are!  Also, prior to the recent midterm elections .. you and Republicans controlled Congress .. yet your own Party wouldn‚Äôt vote to give you the Wall.  Both Dems & Republicans want Border Security, but most believe advanced technology and more personnel on the ground is more cost effective than building a Monument to the ‚ÄúTRUMP‚Äù name!
Ever heard of executive orders? Bush and Obama used it all the time to get what they wanted and bypassing congress saying they didn't have time to consult them.
MY POTUS! Please stand strong! The Dems are an embarrassment. You can take their pay checks and build OUR border security.! Loved your Points! We need this security.
Freeze congress and senate pay till this is resolved, since they supported the wall and changed after elected
It's more important for the Democratic party to stop trump than to care if America is safe because trump has exposed so much corrupt in Washington DC from both sides
That is exactly why we have made 2 contributions to the "go fund me" Trump wall fund. Almost 20 million so far. 330,000 people have donated so far. That sure should send a message that people want it.
They don't want you to succeed.  Stand your ground and don't back down.  Quitters never win!
Stephen Pierson actually, the majority DO want the wall.  You‚Äôre listening to fake news again.
You're the fake news Joyce. Only a minority, like you, want the wall. The majority of We The People know it's a farce.
Jeff Rockwell you can cite poll after poll.  Anyone can manipulate polls to say what they want.  Trump ran on building a wall and won big....the people want a wall.  I am sick to death of people worrying more about people who are here illegally than they do about American citizens, and I am tired of paying for them.  If you believe walls don‚Äôt work, tell Obama, Pelosi and even the Pope to take down their walls.

The National Emergency isn't the Mexican border, it's a corrupt US President under the control of Putin who's using the border as a distraction from his crimes. Btw where's your tax returns?
Sadly the democrats hate the POTUS more than they love their country.
I've been impressed by the number of things accomplished by Trump. Seemed like every president elected took 3 years to do anything. Only reason Obama got a second term. Was because the dude literally did nothing. Unless you call Obama care something. Even then that was stuffed down our throats with a 17 day government shutdown. All personal bs aside Trump has addressed everything every president tried before him within the first 2 years. Wake up... you don't have to like him to realize what he's doing is working.
You have a phone and a pen, does that ring a bell?  Obama did so much without congressional approval.  Build the W A L L!
The Dems only care about stopping President Trump.  NOTHING else matters!
Since congress does not want to do their job..  How can a member of Congress be removed from office?  Under Article I, Section 5, clause 2, of the Constitution, a Member of Congress may be removed from office before the normal expiration of his or her constitutional term by an ‚Äúexpulsion‚Äù from the Senate (if a Senator) or from the House of Representatives (if a Representative) upon a formal vote on a resolution agreed
WE WANT & NEED A WALL....don't cave to the hypocrites!
Please shutdown CNN also. They spreading false information about the wall.
What's important to Americans is pay for work.  Stop all Washington DC politicos checks and leave the working peoples pay as it is. This country is hitting rock bottom. TSA especially. Security is security no matter where it is. Shame on you trump. Release the pay already. You got my vote the first time but won't be getting it again cause u hate the middle class
What about all the tunnels and all the crooked border patrol that are crossing people to the United States there's border patrol that cross people through the checkpoints for a few thousand dollars..heler
I stand by you President Trump. If the Dems won‚Äôt get on board . Make Mexico pay for the wall. I know you know how to do this. Cut them off. No deals. No more aid or help. No protection. Deport illegals now!! Cut off any aid and all aid to illegals now. Raise tariffs . They will be begging to pay for the wall.

Mr. President, please help newyorkers. Corrupted mayor De Blasio is going to rob our tax payer money to provide health care for the illegals.
Mr. President I know people offer advice everyday, so I won't do that, but if given the opportunity as a citizen of the United States, I would use my constitutional rights to help fix the corruption in Washington. I know the solution, if interested someone please contact me. I've been researching this since the day you took office. Ready and willing.
Thank you Mr. President for taking this country's safety and well-being seriously! The Dems have vowed since day 1 to not work with you and the only reason they won't is because of their vile hatred for you. They continue to throw a big temper tantrum because they didn't get their way and the country is suffering because of it
Most of the drugs come directly through U.S. ports of entry ‚Äî the official border crossings. Smuggling engineers use constantly evolving tactics to hide the contraband in fake vehicle panels, secret compartments or deep inside engine parts. Cartel chemists have learned to liquefy meth to make it look like water. And super-potent fentanyl is so compact that pedestrian couriers can walk it through border gates hidden in clothing, shoes or body cavities  They are also playing the odds. San Diego‚Äôs main crossing at San Ysidro, the southern terminus of U.S. Interstate 5, is the busiest land border in the Western Hemisphere, where 70,000 vehicle passengers and 20,000 pedestrians enter the United States each day. For smuggling high-value narcotics, blending in is a better bet than sneaking around.  While seizures of hard drugs are at record levels ‚Äî indicating an unprecedented volume of narcotics entering the United States, experts say ‚Äî arrests of illegal border crossers dropped last year to the lowest level since 1971.  The money would be better spent using hi tech monitoring and hiring more U.S. customs officers whose job it is to facilitate trade and travel while stopping narcotics and other threats.
Mexico could have saved themselves Billions if they would have built the wall themselves.
Build the "We the people' Wall. It is not Trumps wall it's "We the people" wall. Stand strong Trump!!! #MYPRESIDENT‚ù§

People with NO KNOWLEDGE crack me up.. Secure Fence Act 2006 Voted for by Obama and Clinton ,praised by Democrats ...  Double wall chain link fences almost 700 miles... Projected cost 1.7 billion TOTAL COST ALMOST 50 BILLION ... Get a freaking clue sheep ... Why is everything so great when it's the Dems agenda but when it's Trump's Agenda it's ALL WRONG ??????  Come on people common sense please ...
YES WE DO!!! The Dems need to just give the American People what we deserve a sense of security!!!!
Nancy Pelosi DC ph# (202)-225-4965 left message... build the wall. Here's Chuck Schumer DC ph# (202) 224-6542. Repost numbers. Let's do this...Build the Wall! Everyone call!! Fill their machines with BUILD THE WALL!!!‚Ä¶ #Trump #Trump2020 #MAGA #BuildThatWall
This Veteran, immigrant and proud US citizen says... build it, Mr President.
Don‚Äôt give in, just stop the Dems paychecks and see how fast they come to the table with a great deal for the American people and this great country
Mr president you take your supporters republicans for stupid & ignorant Why you don‚Äôt build the wall when you had majority in Congress & representatives
Amber Dagata I don't think the Democrats are even politicians it's all about hating the president
Mr president you take your supporters republicans for stupid & ignorant Why you don‚Äôt build the wall when you had majority in Congress & representatives
They hate President Trump and they will go against anything that he wants to do.  They are hypocrites!
Look at the eyes of Pelosi and Schumer  This is vindictiveness If it was Obama demanding the wall they would be kissing his ring
The reason why they don‚Äôt the wall is because they want the immigrant votes to keep them in power.  If they turn two states to blue, like Texas and Florida, then it would be over for the Republican Party for many years.  There is no compromise with them with this kind of agenda.  I‚Äôd say just call for national emergency security or use the money from El Chapo and get the wall built.  That‚Äôs the only way to block them, as well as providing the border security we desperately need.
I am a Native American ! I was born here. Doesn't that count ?
Build the wall Mr. President and if the dems dont cooperate then shut down the border declare emergency.
The Dems were 100% on board with funding the wall until not so long ago. Their position flipped a 180 and no matter how you look at it, the Dems were wrong then or they are wrong now... They are suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome and they are wrong now!.
How can the Democratic Party argue that the wall is immoral honestly the president is trying to protect not only the us but others in creating a wall to end human ,drug , firearm trafficking, potential terrorist and gang assaults In all levels of the word barbaric in addition the democrats say oh that not going to end anything they will just get visas and come in and do it anyways how ironic and yet they don‚Äôt want to accept any reform he proposed ü§îI still don‚Äôt understand if they are just against anything he says or they could care less about improving national security
We are not blind. The Dems don't care about their fellow Americans, and they don't want you to succeed.

Don't understand why so many people of influence fight your attempts at bettering the United States........
How come They Never tell the Democratic Offer!!!??? & What steps have Dem's taken to negotiate a Compromise!!???? How can U Compare 2 different offers if All They do Is Keep talking about Trump's Offer
Thank you President Trump for wanting to protect the most precious country in the world. I am proud to call you President of the USA
#BULDTHEWALL oh and stop the dems checks and pay everyone else they make 6 figures they got without pay for a bit
Declare Emergency, put troops on the border...be done with it.  If the Dems won't fund it ....Field of Dreams.....BUILD IT.  They will come.
Please go ahead with your executive order. You will never please the dems Too much time spent trying to pacify these cry babies. Get it done we are behind u all the way
If we could get rid of the mentally sick Democrats I have no doubt President Trump would be the greatest President in history!
Sharon Varner I agree!
There just made that crooked Hillary Clinton got beat.  Get over it and build the wall
We all know the answer to that question.  The dems dig their heels in no matter what  campaign promise President Trump tries to fulfill.  Yes, even the ones the dems were all for until he was elected.  the upside to digging their heels in is eventually they will bury themselves.  HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH!!!!
Democrats and Pelosi in particular, are so hung up on what President said about getting Mexico to pay to build the wall. I've seen numerous posts of CITIZENS saying they would contribute to a fund to get the wall build and I'm sure a good majority would contribute!   Personally, I wish Pres. Trump would issue an EMERGENCY ORDER to Build the WALL and circumvent Congress altogether. Obama circumvented Congress plenty of times as I recall!
The Dems don't want you to be successful in any way. Yes we need the wall.
Finally a President that tries to do what he promised. He could do great things if the dems would stop fighting him.
Why did the Dems flip flop the way they did, first full support, now none??? What changed?
Fund the wall!  Also stop the mandate Jimmy Carter made to require American Companies to give away technology to the Chinese.
We see what the dems are trying to do!!!! We‚Äôre behind you potusüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è

Question for anyone willing to answer if the democratic party will not do their jobs to protect the people they serve couldn't the President and the Republican party ask the citizens to step in since they work for the people. I mean read this. Declaration of Independence: In Congress, July 4, 1776. The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
Democratic let these people live in your homes. See if you cry out build the wall. Senators should not be paid, and let these people live in your home.
Mr. Pres. I have a great idea to solve this shutdown and stickier boot into the Democratic Party's mouth. Tell them that you will give them the hundred and $150 billion in foreign aid, And make sure they give you the $5.8 billion for the wall. Here's the deal breaker, but I think this might work. The $54 billion if they want to add to that foreign aid, and you should do this like on camera so the whole world can see, that that $54 billion will be spent at home here in America to take care of and fix the homeless problem. Damn I need to be in politics. Because not only the Republicans would be satisfied, the Democrats would be satisfied and now America would be satisfied that is both parties would be spending $54 billion to help solve the homeless issues. Damn I'm good. Let me know what you think Mr. Donald J. Trump !... let me know if you want me to come work for user :-)

Kim Miller , The 6,000 Migrants Caravan rushing the border that was televised Nationally and others coming say you are delusional and out of touch with reality...MS-13 members are intertwined with the Migrants.. Wake up. They cost American taxpayers over $ 200 Billion per year... üëéüèªüëéüèªand what do you say to the families of the California police officer who was just murdered by a Mexican Illegal.??
Kim Miller , one Killing by And ‚ÄúIllegal ‚Äú is way too many. Kate Steinlie was also murdered by a Migrant. Domestic violence is more broad but with over 300 Million Americans it will be more Duh... Why does America owe Illegals Anything? The videos did not stop either, well unless your watching Fake News like CNN. I‚Äôve seen others on OAN..
Kim Miller , since you seem to be for Open Borders, how many are you willing to take in and care for Education, Housing, Medical???
Kim Miller , well I‚Äôm feeling so sorry for your Blind Delusional CNN Fake News ideas. That won‚Äôt believe your own eyes when seeing the Tent Cities in Tijuana right now. You think the 6,000 came to have a big party??ü§£üòÇüëéüèªü§ê

That's not how you can call the Democrats by telling them that you can open the government as long as they can approve the wall. The president of USA is negotiating with the Democrats to open the government who's the boss, who suppose to make sure that the government is running?  Is it the president or the democrats.
Democrats are obstructionists and always blame Republicans no matter who is the president

Ferris---BS! The House passed the bill but there are not 60 republican's in the senate to pass it. Schumer with many democrat's "voted" for wall funding last yr but they didn't want to give up "chain migration" or "the lottery system", so the bill failed. The democrat's want 1 immigrant to also get 25 of his relative's to get in at the same time & that's OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!!
Alyssa Ferris  I‚Äôm one of the contractors affected by this.  I‚Äôm thankful that I‚Äôm moving on soon from being an EPA contractor.   I‚Äôm glad they are shut down.  I‚Äôve never seen more reckless spending in my life.   I‚Äôve witnessed it for over 10 years, and it‚Äôs bad.   Hurricane Maria?   They spent  hundreds of thousands of dollars on a ‚Äúdog deterrent system‚Äù for their employees for stray dogs, which was an umbrella that you ‚Äúopen aggressively‚Äù and every employee had a class over how to operate it.    I‚Äôve seen residential yards excavated that exceeded the action level for lead at 0.1 mg/kg over cost 1 million dollars or more.  And if you take one speck of dirt to the left, it‚Äôs below that level.   I saw epa employees jobs being highlighting calendars for hurricane Maria and they had to take off Thursdays.   I saw meetings over where to hang a sign, that involved 100 epa employees, that make 100k or more.  1/10 epa employees are worthless.
Patrick Buster I'm all for making the EPA better and more efficient.
Karen Harvey they allocated money for it that Trump still hasn't used.  Now he wants more US taxpayer money for it. Chain migration? Kind of like Melania and her ENTIRE family? Republicans only care about chain migration when the people coming are brown. What do you suggest is put in place as an alternative to the lottery system? No legal immigration at all? We need a better legal immigration process to help address the illegal immigration problem.
Jill Travassos he's on camera saying he'll shut the government down and not blame it on Pelosi and Shumer.  Besides,  they passed a bipartisan temp spending deal to keep the government open and he's rejected it.   This is squarely on Trump.
Patrick Buster totally! I disagree on politics with some of my best friends... even my husband sometimes. üòÇüòÇ
Alyssa Ferris  either way, I‚Äôm glad Jill and I met you, and we can have differing opinions and are friends!
They only care about going against Pres Trump no matter what he does.  Even if they like it they will still disagree with him

Matthew Chavez the people on the ground are saying build a better wall, fence, or some type of barrier.
Buchwald Kevin Not a 30 ft stretch across the entire length. Barriers in some areas, and mainly for BP protection. What the agency is recommending has been thrown in the trash can with no explanation or superior solution.

But Fox News you let Democrat‚Äôs get on there and say MOST Americans don‚Äôt want the wall without calling them out in it. You let them go on and on  about a concrete wall he has said it‚Äôs not going to be! You let them go on and on about Mexico is not going to pay for the wall when you know very well he plans to get through tariffs. Call them out when they lie !
Stand strong President Trump....WE stand with you.

Jeff Lucier Actually I do and they make $15 an hour just I‚Äôm just saying remember how you felt when you didn‚Äôt have a job this person feels the same way
TSA employees on average start at 12 to 13 bucks an hour
You know what the guy makes in 5 years and benefits you or me will.never see. Most city worker make upwards 45-120k and can retire with 15yrs with a full pension the we as taxpayers foot the bill. Me myself I've work 35 yrs full time. These people aren't out of a job, most are on furloughs still cashing in on your dime.
Erik Biggs were you this upset when Obummer shut down the government for 17 days to force his stance on shitty Obamacare? Probably not!
Brent Gordon No because my family has healthcare now that‚Äôs a weak argument
And Brent does your family work for the government or friends did you have anybody calling you asking how they were in a pay their bills and if you could help them
Erik Biggs not a weak argument because, although I am glad your family now has healthcare hence why that topic is easy for you to brush off! Obamacare really fucked up the rest of healthcare for others including myself. The border needs secured for so many reasons Drugs,illegals,terrorists etc. And im sorry we need a wall because we just dont have enough manpower to constantly monitor it at all times.
Erik Biggs occupational risks! No different than Ford or Gm laying people off.weak argument
Brent Gordon Occupational risk what kind of bullshit is that dude you need to go on somebody else‚Äôs post
In the 40 years I‚Äôve been alive I‚Äôve only been laid off from one job government jobs should be secure in our presidents should not be playing with people‚Äôs jobs may be Obama or Trump for some reason you‚Äôre coming on this post and trying to pick a fight I don‚Äôt know you you need to go somewhere else

Erik Biggs I think you forgot. Remember when they said they wouldn't pay, what did trump say. The wall just got 10 ft taller, pepperidge farms remembers.

Jeff Lucier Furthermore why would you even say Mexico was going to pay for it when he knew they weren‚Äôt and then you‚Äôre going to layoff all your government Employees honest people who didn‚Äôt do anything wrong doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me and I‚Äôm sorry you have a difference of opinion
You know a government employee that dont make good money, I dont, and if they can't manage their money that's on them. Everyone seems to not save for a rainy day anymore, and spend more then they have. Also when you hire into those government positions, one must always expect this to happen, it happened many, many times before and know one screamed bloody murder.

There is no disagreement on the need for border security.  However, there is much disasgreement on how to achieve border security.  More Americans (54%) oppose building a new wall.

Why, why aren‚Äôt you speaking about how once the wall is built we will save money by not bringing in as many immigrants.

I don't understand why Americans that want the Wall, can not use money that is...given, donated, or raised by different organizations to build the wall! There has been enough money raised to cover much of what is needed to start building!  Americans are going to pay for the Wall some way, likely by taxing us until we get it built.

Fay Johnson God will not listen Bigotic Trumpee he don't like Liars Coruppt and Criminal Mafiosi and Traitor and Nazi and Racists KKK Members Felon Cheaters Pussy grabber Kidnapper Blackmailer, Trumpsupporter,  destroyer of his Creation the Enviroment  Shutup with dump naive Bigotic Comments  Proof : Read Bible Low Minded Trumpee
Mike Holub so sad you saying something like that
Tom Murphy too late for that, though. The wall is simply going up.  It‚Äôs already been started
Trump in his address said that Sen. Charles E. Schumer ‚Äúhas repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected.‚Äù  Schumer, Hillary Clinton and many other Democrats voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. It passed 283-138 in the House, with 64 Democrat votes, and 80-19 in the Senate, with 26 Democrat votes.  But the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself has called the 2006 fence a ‚Äúnothing wall.‚Äù
Fay Johnson for sure. Well God would never listen to a prayer like that.
Build the Wall. You have the authority. Build it....
Rachel Pennells President Trump isn't afraid for himself but for the country! I'm the one that's afraid, these invaders cost a lot of bucks when they get here for social programs! And that, my goof ball, is MY tax dollars!

Huber---You are just incapable or don't want to understand the savings from Trump's new trade deals with Mexico, where we were losing billions every year. He never said Mexico would be sending a check!! The savings from those trade deals will be paying off the wall many times over in the years to come. It's that simple!
Karen Harvey he never said that on the campaign trail. NOT ONE TIME. So, he is a liar.
So we will save $12B in trade from Mexico in just this year? I don't think so.

Tired of Dems. Instead of unifying they keep dividing. Ridiculous.
Mr. President take the money for the wall out of congresses pension funds. This will be a small payback for the money they stole from "We The People" social security funds.

Mr. President take the money for the wall out of congresses pension funds. This will be a small payback for the money they stole from "We The People" social security funds.
Rep. Ra√∫l Grijalva, D-Arizona, said Tuesday on CBSN that the border crisis which President Trump will address in his speech this evening was not a true emergency. Grijalva, who represents the largest stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, called it a "manufactured crisis."  "This is a manufactured crisis, and a crisis that is manufactured by the Trump administration," Grijalva said, arguing that Mr. Trump's speech Tuesday night was going to be about an issue which the president helped to create. "So now we find him giving a speech today that is self-fulfilling."  Every congressperson along southern border opposes border wall funding Views on southern border wall have been consistent since Trump became president Democratic congresswoman after border visit: Trump administration fabricating national security crisis
Security is paramount to stop the funding of the wall (border) is a gamble to our country security and financially

David Leonard  Republicans have been the majority for almost 2 years. They DIDN‚ÄôT  fund the Wall. They know it‚Äôs a waste of money.
Barbara Hansen no, they were playing politics just like the dems... that's why Trump won.
David Leonard  Trump won the Electoral College vote. He actually had 3 million less votes than Hillary.

You know the answer, and it's an easy choice.. Stop YOU . There is a huge difference between boarder security, and a wall that uselessly spends money, to secure ONE boarder. A logistical nightmare, and highly improbable.
nobody other than a small percentage of right wing uneducated idiots want a useless, overpriced wall that will have zero effect on anything!!!
Judy Conrad I‚Äôm curious, how do you like your pussy grabbed?
Mark Glass,  I see, a class act you are not.  Don‚Äôt be so bitter just because no one wants to grab yours.
Judy Conrad well I‚Äôd be an acceptable pick for president for you still.
Mark Glass,  President Trump is a gentleman and a success.  From the looks of your profile pic and the sound of you I doubt you‚Äôll get very far in life.
Judy Conrad are you a product of marrying a citizen to come here?

Zavala---BS! The democrat's walked away & wouldn't talk about it. Pelosi even insulted our Sec. of Homeland Security & told her, she didn't believe the facts she put out. Trump stayed at the WH during Christmas & New Year, to work on this but Pelosi went to Hawaii to vacation. The House passed the bill in Dec & now Schumer & the dem's own the shutdown!
Karen Harvey you forgot the part where the president said he owned it!  In fact he said he was Proud to own it!

God help me. Tariffs are passed on to the purchaser aka customers. Mexico will be passing on the taxes to us. In other words, we will be paying for the tariffs. Your Trump University econ 101 class was a waste of money sweetie.
Why not just make it a condition of providing Mexico the $5.8 Billion in foreign aid that they use it to build the wall?
Mr. President no matter what u do or say they are going to oppose u. So just forget what everybody thinks. Get the job done. Declare national emergency and build that wall. Our safety comes first.

Listen to the voice and look at the face.

I will not believe anything Chuck and Nancy state after Pres. Trump address our nation. it is called common sense we are born with.

So, please don't be so sanctimonious about two different subjects.   I didn't want him as president, but he won and that is the bottomline, now keep his word or suck it up.
Im sorry about that everyone needs to be paid for doing their jobs.  The way I feel about it is we need that wall bad.  I live in a small town in Texas there are so many illegals here.  There are some good people to but alot just don't care.  I have seen them in the stores with ,3 or 4 shopping carts full of food and pay with a food card.  My mom and dad were really in need and only received 16 Dollars of food.  Its really not right for illegals to get food and our own true American citizens can't, when they paid taxes all those years.  We need that wall, fence, or whatever.  Mexico will end up paying for the wall, the trade deal we have with them.  My mom was 75 and my dad 85.
If you give the wall a name so that it won‚Äôt be the Trump wall the Democrats will bend they don‚Äôt want a monument named after you give it a Mexican name who cares just don‚Äôt call it the Trump wall

Simply shut the Southern border until Congress gives you the funds for a wall.   If international shipping doesn't like it, let them put it on a boat.  Let industry put some pressure on Congress.
I am proud of President Donald Trump he is a great American president, he stand firm on his word, his word is like a great foundation that no Demonrat can lay him down to the ground,...

Nothing at the border will stop people running away from violence and poverty and the demand for drugs and the reasons behind it come from within America and no wall will stop the flow.

Please, Mr. President. Many of us are afraid right now, with the way these lawmakers are acting, and not considering what regular American's wanted when we elected you. We are 100 per cent behind you!  We are tired of being scared. Do whatever you have to do to keep us safe by building that wall just as soon as possible.  Thank you for all you are doing for us.

Sir................please say in your address tonight.....it is NOT about stopping people from coming into this country....it is about getting these people to the right PLACE, port of entry, to LEGALLY come in to our great nation. Now they are going / traveling very dangerous roads with very dangerous people. They only people winning on immigration now is coyotes. We let in over 1M people each year LEGALLY in this country. The wall helps people get to he proper place to enter legally, better for all TRUE seekers!!

Say the word sir, and millions of us Patriots will go take care of that foreign invasion at our border üá±üá∑üá±üá∑üá±üá∑
As we know, there are already numerous tunnels under portions of our existing walls.  And there will be more.  Should we build motes around the walls?  I'm all for border patrols, drones, technology as well as sending more personal to the border to expedite the deportation process if the illegals don't qualify for asylum.  A wall would bring a false send of security.

Don't worry about them, build that wall!
Are you gonna build a Canadian border wall also? Or is it only brown people you don't want getting in?

Unfortunately dems don't care what is practical and realistically needed. They just want to throw their tantrums.
All you against the wall, what‚Äôs your solution?

This is not about the wall at all. This is about Democrats refusing to give President Trump something he promised his supporters.
You promised Mexico would pay for it.

Please build the wall President Trump!
stop the house and senates pay checks and you will see results fast
This is nothing more than you pissing all over the democratic majority House. It's clear and easy to see.
Democrats passed legislation the day they took control of the House that offered $1.3 billion for border security, including physical barriers and technology along the U.S. southern border. Dems want effective and sensible border security, not a medieval wall.
Building a wall that Americans directly pay for is not fullfilling your promise.
Call an emergency and get the wall
the demoncrats dont care about America they just want to be rich and have everyone live in hell poverty waste.They dont want America to be United they want anarchy.
Thank you for fighting for the wall!
Africans existed before Israel. Africans are not isralites like whoopie and Oprah are brainwashed to believe. Expose Zionist African exploitation. White corporate men never owned slavery.

Trumpaganda Style and Fox Propaganda. Unreal!!!
A wall is quite possibly the most asinine way of controlling the border, money can be better utilized by providing actual things border patrol needs.  The wall is nothing more that a way of Trump lining his pockets due to the ties he has with the construction companies that will "win" the bids for those fat government contracts.  It's incomprehensible how you and others like you are unable to realize this.  Oh, and don't forget, his promise was that Mexico would pay for it...so why is he now shutting down the government because he wants Americans to pay for it?
Trumpaganda Style and Fox Propaganda. Unreal!!!
Reopen the government already we already got 2 prisons the national guard has had to take over due to no staff. Declare state of emergency and just build it quit using the people that supported you as ponds in this wall game. Quit trying to reason the left dont care.

theres a film on you tube during obama years about needing the wall very informative.
They support border security but not your ‚Äúdream wall‚Äù.
Linda, do I not have a right to an opinion? Or is yours the only one that matters?
Great speech Sir, continue the fight!
but the Dems claim only 6 terrorists come across the southern border, so I would guess only 1.3 would be coming in by air?
Rodney Martin you must be a mathematician or something. Call the president. He needs you.
Rodney Martin Since when are ‚Äúairports‚Äù the same as ‚Äúsouthern border?‚Äù I bet those 6 terrorists understand English better that you do.

This is about protecting our people.  Not about the President‚Äôs campaign promise.  That should not even be mentioned.  This is about protecting our Country from caravans.  This is about having laws that protect our borders and a wall to help in doing that.
For them?  Stopping you Mr President.  We want the wall!!

I just watched the address to the American people and then the joke responce by the Dems. I say fire them all, democrats do not have America first. Return us to a republic like the constitution says. I'm still with you Trump! Build a taller, concrete wall than what was planned.

Kimberly Overen a wall doesn‚Äôt fix anything. Chapo used tunnels, most cartels use planes. Immigration is actually going down over the years. We should spend the money on educating our citizens and stopping the rising cost of health care. Maybe with more educated people, an orange faced reality show host conman wouldn‚Äôt get elected to the most important position in the world. Fox isn‚Äôt news
Then why isn‚Äôt it being done?
Kimberly Overen because immigration is going down. Don‚Äôt believe the bullshit Fox ‚Äúnews‚Äù videos they play on repeat. It‚Äôs called propaganda and it‚Äôs how a lot of very evil people got to power.
Their grandstanding for 2020...they will NEVER Compromise!

And yet schumer is saying the people dont want the wall.
Trump is lying .Democrat's want border Security too ..the Democrat's offered Trump 25 billion .but he declined ...Trump will not sit down and discuss anything .This is all a diversion ...
Build Americas Wall and defend it. Lets have a special election to put it to rest. Chuck and Nancy say they speak for the majority, prove it. Let America Vote and decide. You got the balls Chuck, Nancy? If he loses this vote, the wall, he'll lose 2020. If he does it without you, he'll win.
Build that wall!!! No more foreign aid until our border is secured!
President Trump  Who gets what he wants  (American people Too ) Me Want the wall. Period

The midterms in the House of Representatives was a big surprise to me and to Trump that is why the Democrats think they have the upper hand

Yes we do! And so did the Democrats before you took office. They are not placing our national security as a priority and they certainly are not concerned with federal workers or they would stop with the political games and do what is right.
So true!

Haha, I love how liberal hypocrisy comes back around to bite them in the Ass! 2006 Secure Fence Act, all signed by Odumbo, Godzillary, and Creepy Joe give the President full authority to declare a national emergency and build the wall.

Stopping you from being even stupider then normal.... you are a joke
Chuck and Nancy are in the fetal position right now. Lol They're going to have to stay that way. They are not running the show. And they have not won the 2020 election like they think they have.

All the bad people use tunnels to get here, walls will NOT prevent that
David Meiling The majority of Americans don't want the wall! Stop watching Fox News and you will get the truth.

We DO want the wall

Can't pay for your friend... Sorry.....too busy paying for a family of eight that snuck over the border to take the money I had set aside for your friend. They don't care if your friends live, and I can't afford to pay for both them and you. I reckon someone needs to prioritize who "needs" what...

Mohamed Hassan Bashle and if they come legally, I'd welcome them with open arms.   Our actual fear is an unsecured border with people named Mohamed and Hassan sneaking in with bad intentions.

Thank you for respecting our President Trump, We citizens who voted for him think he is amazing for America.  God Bless you for your letting us know how you feel personally!!
Has anyone looked into the real reason why they are so against the Wall. They voted for it before so Trump Hate isn't enough. It's a cover.
Great speech tonight. God bless you, President Trump, for putting the American citizens first.
Border security is not the wall. It is technology, sensors, drones and border agents. Be smart.
Their it is folks most of us do want the wall
I never cared who paid for it, I just want it built.
Because your promise is a downright brainwashed lie
KEEP STRONG PRESIDENT TRUMP AND BUILD THAT WAS--THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS AND BE WITH YOU

They think if they stop you on one of your campaign promises they will win in 2020 . News flash it is showing what they are really about Corrupt
That is an easy question.  They do not care about WE, THE PEOPLE, we are the ones who elected you!  They want us all to lose!  And, I firmly believe, if they win, we are doomed as a nation.  Don't give in, PLEASE!!
What is going to be done with the $20 Million wall prototypes?
I‚Äôd Tell them, When Pelosi, Schumer, warren and the other liberal nitwits remove their walls/ fences, and door locks  from their homes, we‚Äôll have a meaningful discussion. I‚Äôm sure they wouldn‚Äôt mind some harmless person they don‚Äôt know just coming in.

They'll destroy their party, just to make President Trump out to be a liar.
You made me proud when you got up from that chair in the Situation Room and walked out on the Commies, because all they wanted to do was obstruct. They had no intentions of negotiating for a WALL and to open the government! Thank you Mr. President for having such strong convictions and for holding true to your oath to protect us!  Now, do what you need to do to get the WALL built. We are behind you 100%.
Lydia, this is NOT true!! Even the democrats wanted the wall at one point.
I have NEVER heard a democrat say they don‚Äôt want border security.  Unfortunately, you are able to convince your trumpkins that only 4th century technology will secure our borders.
Lol then why didn't you build it during the 2 years when you had control of congress? Don't blame Democrats, not even the Republicans wanted it.
You aren't fulfilling your promise with a wall if TAXPAYERS pay for it.
The only things DEMs care about, is destroying this country and wanting you to fail. They don‚Äôt care about our citizens or our safety, they have no respect for this country or the history of it, they‚Äôll all nuts. Stand firm, build the wall and God bless you

Man-Baby is in his terrible twos. "He shuts down the government, maybe for ‚Äúyears.‚Äù He wants a wall that is ‚Äútransparent,‚Äù then concrete, then slatted, then steel. One moment he‚Äôs leaving Syria, the next he isn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs watching too much TV and yelling at everyone. This is all to be expected. President Trump is entering his terrible twos.  The Trump presidency turns two this month, and though we often hear the mantra ‚Äúthis is not normal,‚Äù what the president is doing actually is normal. For a 2-year-old.  According to Dr. Benjamin Spock, "The 2-year-old has a hard time making up his mind, and then he wants to change it,‚Äù his ‚Äúunderstanding of the world is still so limited,‚Äù and ‚Äúhe becomes bolder and more daring in his experiments.‚Äù  And when Trump has a tantrum, ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt help to yell at your child, threaten punishment, plead for calm, or try too hard to ‚Äòmake everything better.‚Äô ‚Äù This ‚Äújust tends to make tantrums last longer.‚Äù Instead, ignore the outburst, and later, ‚Äúa quick word of praise along the lines of ‚ÄòNice job pulling yourself together‚Äô can let your child salvage some self-esteem.‚Äù ‚Äì Dana Milbank
Donald Trump isn‚Äôt sure The Wall exists. At various times, he has said that much of it has ‚Äúalready been built‚Äù‚Äînot true. He‚Äôs said that Mexico is already paying for it, through a trade deal that has yet to be ratified‚Äîalso not true, and flat out impossible, at that. - Politico
Having "MEXICO" pay for the wall as promised.
All the want is illegals for the votes so Republicans never win another election. That's what's this is all about. Stand firm stand strong. Do not back down we the people are behind you.
Make it legal for people to sell their US citizenship.. Ill GLADLY sell mine and never set foot in this country again
Just watched Chuck Turd on NBC Nightly News!  Actually questioned the Credibility of Trump????!!!!
OK, here's your compromise and solution. Have the 1.8 million DACA aka *dreamers* pay 5k each for US Citizenship. Wall gets funded, DACA's become citizens and best part? Mexican's funded the wall! (Mic drop!)

The most important thing on their agenda is getting rid of President Trump!!!  doesn't that throw up a red flag,   people !!!!!!!!!
Yes keep up the good work..... Build that WALL
What blithering nonsense. You want this Trump Shutdown to coerce your own way with this idiotic Wall.
Thank you build that wall prayers for you

It wasn't important to the Republicans over the last to year Fuhrer Donnie - stop trying to blame your superiors, Democrats.
Democrats don't want the wall because it's permanent. And they think they'll win elections in 2020. Fix the voting system or all the things you've done for the American people will be lost to socialism.
Unfortunately not very authentic. Address does not extend to an objectivity beyond a subjective problem of the president. Sorry to mention this here.
Jeanne Rogers Really UNINFORMED...
Wait, what‚Äôs more important to you?  The wall or helping Americans?
Here's the thing...they're going to try to sell you on more expensive "border control" options that they can repeal later. I think people need to know that permanence is a huge factor...we need this wall because it will stand without as much further funding. I'm all for fitting the wall with high tech security. I think we need electronic monitoring, and I am content with razor wire. Add underground monitoring and I think if it can automatically detect wall attackers and fire tear gas..I think that would be sweet.
BUILD THE WALL !! NOW ...YOU ARE WASTING TIME NOT MONEY !!
Stopping 2020 of course.  You can‚Äôt get a big win or they‚Äôre toast and they know it.
Great speech Mr President!Democrates should be arrested for open borders!
Stopping is #1 , because  next your promise term limits
all of congress wants border security - just not a wall
The only temper tantrum I see if from them. They can‚Äôt handle the truth.
We all know it‚Äôs because they want to try to make you fail. They supported everything you want before you wanted it. You won‚Äôt fail. I have faith in you!!!

Democrats do nothing but lie and plot and they are the enemies of America.
I believe our president needs to go to plan B...Dems will not support anything he puts forward!
They clearly do not care about the safety of Americans! Ship them out, and build the wall! It's not only Trump wanting it you morans, it's the American people! Take away their fences, walls, and security guards they have protecting their homes, and we'll see how much of a fight they would put up then!
They want to stop you!  Only for their own political careers.

Ha Ha you snowflakes arent gettin the wall, Nancy said so!
Best President ever, President Trump.   Build the wall
Best President ever for the working class
As the President stated, we need the Wall/Barrier as it is ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù - There is another caravan forming larger than the last two - We are being ‚Äúinvaded‚Äù - Pelosi & Schumer won‚Äôt even allow ‚Äú$1 towards the Wall‚Äù - these are the leaders of the Dims ! They could end the shutdown in 15 minutes!!!
You are fake news and enemy of the people.
They will never work with you on anything, sorry you have to go threw all of this for trying to protect Americans. God bless you
We Want A Big Beautiful American Made Steel Fence!!!
It's all of us we voted for it they are doing this to all of us.
The American People of today, do not care about this because most of them live in a Fantasy World. Only when a full out war breaks out on our soil will they finally understand.
As you throw your demented little toddler temper tantrum, while holding our nation hostage for your unnecessary and ineffectual "Wall", keep this in mind. Soon and very soon, you will have all the big beautiful, strong, tall, wonderful walls the lying, criminal, traitorous teeny tiny little flap of flesh you call a heart,  can deal with. Bob's coming. He brought down the Gambinos. He is more than capable enough to take care of you and your entire cabal. Sleep well.

Trump stand tall, stick to your demands, we legals deserve your protection. Democrats will say no to anything Trump wants,
American the mother of the world should be protected by all means before the Arabs and the Islamic,  Soviet associates could wipe out other people in the face of this world.  Donald Trump the great man. My support for Nairobi.
They need to be impeached for refusing to pry America , which they promised when sworn in. Nancy just lured big time when once again accepting that gavel
Giants will fall because Jesus Reigns!!! Democrats are having pride before their destruction
If there wall means nothing then why are they fighting our president so hard. They send more money than he is asking for to help other countries.. I am a registered  dem.  But they are way out of line doing things out of spite. Do what they people want that's why we put you in there
Why are so many against them wall what is it gonna hurt if it makes people feel safer and if you are here legal  then why would you care.  We are all kinds of people from many places I don't think people want that to be different I just think people want others to come here they right way and do their part
Tried to give you a heads up, but I got a flag that I have been blocked from Facebook.
President Trump that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about their corrupt to the core and you have a rattled their bones And they‚Äôre scared
If the govt is shut down, then no one in Washington should be getting a pay check either!!  Build the wall!!! I know plenty of national guard folks who are ready to help!!
Democrats don't care what their constituents want.  They will vote for them anyway.
The numbers show Americans want border security, but don‚Äôt want to pay for a wall. Trump promised Mexico would pay for it. Don‚Äôt forget that.

Everyone: Call your Congresswo/man and Senators today (WED) 202-224-3121 and Demand $5.6 Billion WALL Funds!
We want to feel safe in our homes. We want our families to bfeel safe. We cannot do that without a wall and added security! Thank you, Mr. President, for standing up for America!

What is the actual argument against a wall, besides it‚Äôs immoral.
Kevin Lee Groves and we are here because we are patriots who live our country, and refuse to see trump continue to destroy it.
Looks like America will be hiring mexican( qualified) workers for air traffic control jobs at half price. This might trouble retired controllers because pensions will be in jeopardy because future employees will not be paying in for retirement. LOL
John Fortney funny. Some of the young Controllers in training or newly certified are worried about missing a pay check. The whole damn thing is a shitshow, but that's nothing new, is it.   If it is truly a Emergency then Trump should declare or be derelict in his duties. Other than that it's a desperate act of a desperate man.
Steve Swisher my point was it could be worse. I understand when people work for or under the government it kidda dictates their thought process. Glad I'm not relying on the government just paying for it. Your welcome.

The law today is still the law TODAY.  I don't care - they are not criminals, terrorists and can SUPPORT THEMSELVES. We need to look at the other side of the coin and realize what is actually coming into this country.  I say NO MORE REFUGEES as well.  Criminalize stepping across this our border if not at a port of entry, and start keeping statistics of those in our prisons that are illegals as well.  Keeping data on just how much these freeloaders are costing us in 'BORROWED' tax funds is essential.  It's our money - we need to see where it goes.

America wants healthcare and education.  America wants stability and prosperity again.
My HEART is with those Federal workers. I Pray that the Democrats will do their job and reopen the government by giving the American people the money to really secure our borders. President Trump, Please Stand your ground and keep doing what you are doing. You are the 1st President to combat this head on and to keep your promises. TRUMP 2020

You had two years , sleeping much
Selfish jerks on their own agenda. Nothing more. We won‚Äôt get anywhere this way. Sad to say.

Turn ALL borders security over to the Pentagon and order them secured. Add Homeland Security, Coast Guard, and NASA to essential personnel. Then end shutdown it is effecting 2020 now.

Mr. President  you are doing a great job for this country.  The true Americans appreciate  it and respect your decisions.
100% obstruction is what they care about. They cannot accept they were wrong.
Democrats know a wall would be effective ! They don‚Äôt want us to shut their  future voter base out! They know most of the American people  will not support their epic corruption and lies!üá∫üá∏
They want to stop anything you do that‚Äôs for sure.
Will you PLEASE shut up!!! You are the living embodiment of everything that‚Äôs wrong with this country!!!
Your promise was broken when Mexico didn't pay. Bipartisan support gave you the technology and everything else on the list. This is on you!  Also you forgot to mention the two children who died because of your policy. Their blood is on your hand. And meeting with actual victims? Holding hands? Hugging? You don't even hug your wife and kids!

Stopping your success is way more important than the security of us pesky Americans.

Sadly dems seem to even want to hurt all Americans to make their political point of hate of the Pres.  It's not just about the wall, it's all his legistlation.  He won and he leads...and also when they win will they also want the Rep to return the same?  This leaves America hurt.  We must keep our country and all our people in mind.  So far, I'd say all of Congress has failed.  They will not negotiate.  They have no solutions and go home when the tough gets going...to vacation.  Leadership like Pelosi in HI is an example....she should have stayed and led the discussions with  Pres. Trump.andt worked until they found a solution....not left the room.  We would expect this from our teenagers...when the tough get going the going GET TOUGH...be thoughtful of fellow Americans and our Country!

MY FRIEND HAS AN IDEA... he shared.. I have an idea to give the democrats a little incentive to fund the wall. Every time an American citizen is maimed or killed by an illegal immigrant, a democrat politician gets executed, chosen by the victims family....that wall would be built in a week...
It is sickening to think that some Americans ignore the American Citizens and their families safety. Build the Wall!
Great speech. We need border security. Stay strong. We are with you. Build the wall
You said that Mexico would pay for the wall .  Keep that promise and I will be impressed.
So increase border security. The wall isn't it fam

Building a wall or more walls, will protect the people who dare to make that very dangerous trek.  It will force them to find a legal (albeit slower) way to enter this country.  This very wall will protect those women and children who are being harmed!!

Forget the traitor Democrats. Do what you need to do.  We have to have the wall. Thank you so much President Trump. You are awesome.
Nothing is more important to them than increasing their party's political power.  That's pretty obvious.  They don't want to just stop you.  They would be just as happy to make Pence or any other Republican their target.

Americans want MEXICO to pay for the wall like you promised. Not making them work for free because you shut the government down over funding you claimed you secured through an ‚Äúagreement‚Äù. Now stop lying to the world. The only crisis at the border are the ICE agents killing and abusing human beings.

Dont listen to the genderless fruitcakes, keep it up Trump!
We can get mexico to pay for it, just use the seized drug money we get on a daily basis to build the wall. The millions of dollars worth of marijuana  that gets found at the border can be sold at our new dispensaries.  Boom, cartels paid for our wall!
You know the answer to that as well as we do.. Just build the damn wall and to hades with that witch..
The only person trying to resolve this is My President!  Socialists, no show!
I support President Trump and his call for border security, including a wall.
Tune in tonight and listen to him lie to the whole world.

And I hope every single person on my feed reads this and many share it. You want to know why I‚Äôm pissed about the borders and the ‚ÄúMigrant Caravan‚Äù? I‚Äôm a 90% disabled combat vet, medically retired, like thousands of others. I‚Äôve been out of work over a year, and with the amount of VA appointments, and the amount of time per appointment, who the hell would hire me? I barely pay my mortgage and bills, I juggle repo on my vehicles and termination on utilities monthly, and we eat, ramen and cereal on a regular basis. We shop at Goodwill and frequent PawnShops not only to shop but to get loans to pay bills or maybe get something we need from time to time. Social Security won‚Äôt approve me, and State and Federal assistance programs say I am above their ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù levels, so they won‚Äôt help me. Yet some of you think it‚Äôs ok to allow migrants with nothing to offer our Nation a free pass into this country and you cannot tell me that it won‚Äôt cost the tax payer anything. I barely get approved for free lunches for my girls at school and the taxes in Virginia I cant afford to pay, and again, you want to allow these migrants to just walk in...and you want me to offer open arms?  How about you take care of us? All of us? I‚Äôm not the only one. There are many way worse than me. There are homeless. There are sick. There are hungry. In this nation. That have paid their dues. Born here. Raised here. Paid taxes here. Worked here, served here. Take care of them.  It‚Äôs time to close the revolving door of free and take care of Americans first.  Think about that crap for a second."
BUILD THE WALL!! WE STAND WITH YOU, MR . PRESIDENT!
This is what you get when you don‚Äôt elect an ass kisser.   Go Trump!
Stand firm for what's right President Trump.  Don't let them browbeat you down.  We're standing with you.
Mialei Iske And you have a a good swim across the ocean
Why can't we vote on the wall?
That's it exactly if we get the wall they know that they are done in 2020
Because shortly after Trump's inauguration, all immigration detainees holding facilities, and ALL immigration procedures were privatized. All for-profit at the federal level with Sessions aid!
Ty for staying strong! We need to stop all paychecks to the Senate until it gets done
BUILD THE WALL, I support you 100% You are doing what is best for the American people, the ones who wants to come here needs to do it legally! I truly admire you and your family, the USA is blessed to have you as President!! God bless you & family, God bless the USA!!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Stopping you and preserving their chance at power again. What they are doing might‚Äîno, will bite them.

Americans don't want to pay for a wall you promised Mexico would pay for.  If I have to choose between 5 billion for part of a wall, or 3.5 billion to solve our healthcare problem... I choose healthcare. But apparently, despite the fact it'd save orders of magnitude more lives and improve quality of life for even more, addressing healthcare is "too expensive"... yet still cheaper than your not-quite-wall.  And you said you'd own the shutdown... well, now you own it.
James Flatmo 3.5 billion won't touch healthcare...look how much we spend on healthcare for illegal immigrants...https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/the-fiscal-cost-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-the-us-taxpayer

his promise was mexico would pay for it.
I agree but so does all civilized society , look what is happening all over Europe and covered up by the media and is controlled by the globalists Illuminati.
Democrats want strong borders, too.   We just realize that your stupid wall won‚Äôt work.
Use the Army core of engineers to build a barbed wire wall.
Have mexico pay for it
Americans know exactly what the Democrats are playing....and we're tired.....Trump 2020
Do what God tells you to do sir. We are with you.

Why must you always start with negativism about Democrats you are the president No one is  stopping you from fulfilling your promise they are trying to tell you you were mistaken with the promise and you need to do other things which are better and explain why
Susan Rainville Fuller that's one of the big problems the Dems don't listen.  They are so upset that he won they won't listen.  It's a shame.  I don't understand how they can give 52 million for aid that includes money for abortions but they refuse to help American citizens.  Wish they would explain that.

Heaven has a wall, a gate and a strict immigration policy. Hell has open borders. Let that sink in.
Please come out with a pro-oxygen campaign so all these snowflakes can resist.

Marion Sorel Trump is doing what we the American people voted for him to do...Build The Wall!
What‚Äôs more important a Wall or People being able to provide for their families!! Time for Congress to change the laws on Shutting down the Government!! The Government should never ever be able to shut down without the votes coming from the house and the senate approval!! This needs to soon be enforced because every-time U cannot have your way this is exactly what U will do!! RESIGN
Amy Perry Jenson yes, exactly what Obama did to get his way. Great teaching by example.
Karen Solis Nimmo Hugh difference a wall and saving people‚Äôs lives!! Besides President Obama didn‚Äôt Promise that Mexico would pay for our Insuranceüò≥üò≥
Marion Sorel Trump is doing what we the American people voted for him to do...Build The Wall!
Just 11 days ago the Republicans held the Senate, the house and the WH and still couldn‚Äôt pass a bill for the wall!! The Republicans CLEARLY do NOT want a wall!
There agenda is to bring you down, they dont care about the people! TRUMP 20/208
They don't care about the people... only money and power.
One of the rare individuals in politics who cares about the safety of his citizens, unlike Merkel, Trudeau and cie.
Keep the government shut down.  Let them protest.
ROFL, why show Fox News, everyone knows it's fake.

CBS stated before the President spoke that their polls show only 59% of the people want the wall.  I CALL BULLSHIT!
Janice Webre  that's over half...lol
I think it's higher.
Suggestion. NEVER mention "campaign promise"!! It sounds self serving. Just zero in on the necessity and urgency of A WALL!! Why! And how!
I think it's higher.
Your are just slobbering at the idea of raping our coffers for more money for your pocket.
YOU STILL MAD BRO?  YOUR TEAM LOST..BIGLY. LOVE YOUR TEARS. KEEP EM COMING.  ENTERTAINMENT IS ALL MINE!  #KAG
Janice Webre  that's over half...lol
Democrats hate Mr Trump and just for that reason they want to say NO  to everything that he propose
https://www.facebook.com/100003832833605/posts/1128381830632901/   I think the left is confused
Democrats have lost their sanity. Ignore them. Build the wall.
Keep it up Mr. President, don't give them an inch!
The answer to that question is painfully obvious Mr. President judging by their petty opposition to something they ALL wanted before it was YOU asking for it.
I think you should stop worrying about this wall and start trying to figure on how you are going to keep Junior from going to prison.
Lmao , we all know the answer to that question Trump.
YOU STILL MAD BRO?  YOUR TEAM LOST..BIGLY. LOVE YOUR TEARS. KEEP EM COMING.  ENTERTAINMENT IS ALL MINE!  #KAG
stopping you......it is their one and only goal.  We are behind you 100% no matter what you decide #BuildTheWallNow
this country is in a state of emergency by all means we must control the border. its now of never. if we dont stop this attack we are done as a nation! potus trump you can call the state of emergency due to the unprecedented deaths of our children due to the opiod crisis. that would be a great startPLEASE DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY! WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK. AND YOU WILL WIN IN 2020. THANK YOU SIR!
demon rats have no cause other than to promote their idiotic hatred and jealousy
Yes we need the wall and more border patrol  and more judges.
For sure is to stop your promise. Forget about ‚Äúwork together‚Äù Their agenda is NWO
We need to protect the American people
But them Demarats say that's not who we are, confusing
Stand atrong build the Wall!
They would rather try and knock you down every chance they get than to make the right decision. Maybe its time to take them all on a field trip to the damn border!
How many ILLEGALS coming here are Human Traffickers ? We must have a WALL to keep them from sneaking through.

Stopping you from fulfilling your promises,  definitely.
And people voted for that promise why these demwits always against everything?
Remember weeks ago the Democrats and media criticized Trump for not listening to the generals?  Today, Democrats aren't listening to the border agents and ICE agents.
So with a shabby wall they confiscated 13000lbs of fentynal.  Thats almost 3 MILLION DEADLY doses.  Especially in this area, with death after death, who says we dont need a wall???!!
Why do we have to beg so hard to spend our own money on our own country?
Bless you POTUS and lets build that wall.

Splain that wall in China...
Really scary that so many thousands of Trump cultists liking and loving more Russian bot comments here.
Um, your promise was that Mexico would pay for the wall, so that ship has already sailed! Want to try again?
Stopping you seems to the Dems and RINOS to be far more important than the health and security of The People. Stay the course, Mr. President! Their treason is not going unnoticed.
God is going to put his hand on this. MAGA üá∫üá∏
There is only one thing the Democrats want, to get back in Power even if that means claiming that the earth is flat and the moon a water droplet in the sky... they are of extremely low intelligence and lazy as anyone can be
Americans want Border Security!!! Build the wall!
I wish we can have a President whom love his country passionately with deep heart  In my country just for one week...
Wrong the only reason the Goverment is closed is because Trump is insane.
Liz Hall Believing his lies doesn't make you informed.
They are going to be a has been party. Some of there party are already pulling away from them!!!!
Dear Mr.President, Shut down the gov. Build the wall. Deport the illegals. The citizens of this country stand behind you
Trump Derangement Syndrome on full display - the party of the Ass has stuck their heads fully up their own asses and are too busy hashtag "resisting" to do anything productive.   Hold the line Mr. President - we need the wall.
We‚Äôre with you, Mr. President!  Thank you for standing strong!
...so, do live in a country that embraces democracy or a dictatorship
...then don't make promises you know you can't keep.  Administering the Office of Presidency does not include making unrealistic and reasonable promises.
...history where there is absolute rule without democracy
Godspeed Mr. President!!  We love you for standing your ground for America!
You came across weak and untruthful yet again.
Wrong the only reason the Goverment is closed is because Trump is insane.
You came across weak and untruthful yet again.
For the brainless Democrats?.....stopping you from fulfilling another promise is more important Mr. President! They do not care about us or our country's security.
His promise was Mexico was going to pay for it not the tax payers.
Robert Betancourt, so if you were to be up to speed on the facts....Mexico is in fact paying for the border barrier along with substationally much much more through the new trade agreement that replaced the doomed NAFTA.

Can you build the wall without congress?
Years of discussions and misunderstandings to come. That will be the cost!
The president threatens California over wildfire funding. Waiting for him to threaten Florida and Texas over hurricanes. Perhaps Michigan and Ohio are next over snowstorms? Step back and think about this....we have a President threatening funding to his own people for disastrous wildfires.
DON'T LISTEN TO THOSE PAFOONS..
KEEP UP THE FIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!!
Best President in my lifetime and I have lived through 10 others
We need the wall !!! And Trump will be the man to get it done!
Build the wall...what part of illegal is hard to understand!!! UPHOLD OUR LAWS...

We love you, you are good Mister President, G'd bless you, greetings from Tzefat Israel.
Still no negotiations with the newly elected President of Mexico,Manuel Obrador.The .President stated weeks ago that he would take full responsibility for the shutdown but now blames Democrats. who want to open it back up!.
If you support the wall call this number 800-350-6647 then press 1 it tells the government we want the wall. I just did it.
When you consider the trillions spent on national defence every year wall is a pretty small expense.
To keep you from doing any and all of it.
I have set posts from this page to appear at the top, but I'm just now seeing it at the top. üò°
I wish he'd stop trying to take credit for everything.  Makes it more difficult dealing with democrats.
Yes an Pelosi said herself that she would together in a bipartisan way boy she lied. She just wanted to the speaker well she got her way. Her n Schumer need to be tossed out on their ass

LOLOLOLOL ANOTHER??? What were the other lies, er, 'promises'???
I know you have to work hard to make it look like you‚Äôre actually trying to keep your promise about the wall, but we know it‚Äôs just an attempt to distract from breaking your other campaign promises, like your promise to support the 2nd Amendment - instead you‚Äôre pushing gun control
It‚Äôs time to take a stand We the People!! Share with everyone. Call those numbers. I‚Äôve never seen anything like the duo & don‚Äôt want them thinking they know what‚Äôs right for us. Let‚Äôs not be complacent. It‚Äôs not like it used to be & we need to do our part. We can do this!!
President Trump, please use the Nuclear Option and call a State of Emergency.  Forget Congress! The Demos are a waste of time!
Stay strong and build the wall we love you
STAND OUR GROUND KEEP THE GOV SHUT DOWN!#PRESIDENTIALADDRESS
Only problem with your statement is that ALL POLITICIANS from BOTH PARTIES support border security, and provided $2.9billion for that over the last two years, most of which you have not spent. They understand the needs at the border which include many things, but not your wall.
They going to treat u as JESUS
Hang tough, President Trump...we are with you all the way
Micheal Marceaux facts
Hang tough, President Trump...we are with you all the way
democrats know they need the wall they have said it in the past many time about border security BUT they don't want to give into trump. If it saves one life, just 1 life, then it was worth it
Technology would do more, for less, but a scalable, tunnelable wall is the best thing his simple mind could come up with.
They going to treat u as JESUS
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Hector is gonna be running 3 Honda Civic's with spoon engines. On top of that he just came into Harry's and ordered 3 t66 turbo's with NOS's and a Motec System Exhaust.
The promise was you will build a wall and Mexico will pay for it. So.......
62% of the people don‚Äôt want to spend that much tax money on a wall .
a secure border does not necessarily mean a wall
his words people.."his" promise,,,,, the fucking dictator does not say one of the republican promises... the dutard
Thank you üëç wish you the best. Build the wall make it tall round them up get rid of them all. If  people don‚Äôt like my remark don‚Äôt bother to reply not open for discussion!!!!
I want a wall, a strong military, and to feel safe again.  I want politicians who behave with dignity, not ones who address the congress of the U.S. with street lingo, nor chews their cud when they don't get their way, nor uses millions of $American tax to prove NOTHING!  I voted for Donald Trump and I'm glad I did.  I want America back.
What's more important to Democrat voters? Murder and rape!
Let the people vote on it!
Technology would do more, for less, but a scalable, tunnelable wall is the best thing his simple mind could come up with.
YOUR PROMISE WAS THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR IT.  NOT US!
Nailed it they are doing it to see you fail.  We are behind you President Trump!!
Time for that wall!  TRUMP 2020!  I've donated to wewillfundthewall.com and I will do it again.  We could just do it wth machine guns and land mines but I would rather have a wall.
54 billion to foreign governments, yet we can't get 5 to protect our own. What a joke!
No America‚Äôs hurt during the shut down ban all illegal aide EBT WIC only Americans. And take pensions from the Senate and house till we get our boarders up and not take hard working Americans who have earned their social security! Why should they be paid? What makes the exempted!
Stay strong President Trump..dont cave to the hostage holders of our rights.
They just one to stop you for doing what is right.
Let the people vote on it!
Who cares what the loser left wants...GET IT DONE NOW!!!!

Stopping you, you know that tho. Keep up your great work mr trump
They just one to stop you for doing what is right.
Stopping you, you know that tho. Keep up your great work mr trump

Wish he would had mentioned the triple amputee and the many Americans that donated to Go Fund Me. to assist in the wall being built!!!! We the people want the wall!!! If not why would so much money be collected so quickly???
Tell the demonrats you want the wall to keep out trump supporters
Those are their voters. Introduce a bill that you have to pay tax in order to vote and have a say on how government spends tax dollars. Double down.
Make sure who you vote for in the next election, 2020 comes fast.

CAMBRIDGE, Ma. ‚Äì A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at MIT suggests Americans living in the United States could find themselves outnumbered by illegal immigrants by a staggering ratio of at least two to one within the next ten years unless significant changes are made to U.S. immigration policy

Harriet Jones another demorat... Crawl back under your bridge, you troll
GREAT SPEECH......BUIL THE WALL....PRAYING FOR YOU ALWAYS
It would be a greater step toward US security if we build an impenetrable wall around Mar a Lago ( whenTrump is home)
Obstruction is their only goal.
What's more important ???   FACTS ... no lies, exaggerations, immigration reform that does not cost $5.6 billion (and counting per Pence's recent TV interview).    I hope the FACT checkers are working overtime tonight ....
When will Deceptive Hodor Donnie stop lying to his supporters?
The most important thing for the entire world is to get you out of the Oval Office ASAP.
Let's charge a $10.00 border crossing fee or tole per person. And use that money to build the wall and strenthin our border.

Please declare a national emergency because there is a national emergency.  If you declare a national emergency and build the wall and institute e-verify, and do other things to secure our sovereignty, you WILL BE RE-ELECTED!
Love you and build the wall !!!
Please Mr. President, BUILD THE WALL. We live in Dallas County Texas (a sanctuary county) and we are overrun with illegal aliens - so many that our public school signage is in Spanish!
We'll get the wall up one way, or another!
We want a 'Great Wall' just like the one China has, protecting their/our border.  I can see it now!  Thank you President, Donald J. Trump.  Stand your ground....make this your utmost priority!  If it takes two more years...we'll elect you another 4 after that.  Let's BUILD THE WALL!!!üá∫üá∏
He said  Mexico is paying for it! So why shut down the government????
Uh not according to like.... everyone. The wall is not what America wants. The majority of America infact opposes this concept, now please try to come up with real ideas that don't tear our country further into a divide. Please find something that doesn't make us look like our grandfather's enemies. Comprehensive border security is possible and bipartisan consensus can be reached if epic demands are met with constructive bipartisanship. If you want to be the greatest President you have to remember that our America isn't your Trumpica, we have people of all political inclinations and you are supposed to represent us all. Not just pander to the base...
I think that the Congress and senators should not get paid during the shut down either. They have a year to make sure that our government has a spending account put together before the beginning of the next year. Because they did not do so that is why they are having  the shutdown. So that shows  American people that government are not doing their job for the American people.
It's all about removing or stoping Trump, not about the agenda, or the health of the country, it's personal, and viscous
Where does Pelosi get her information on the American Citizens do not want the wall. She must be asking her grand kids. or her Nephew Pretty Boy Gooseman AKA Newsom.
Let's charge a $10.00 border crossing fee or tole per person. And use that money to build the wall and strenthin our border.

This is not about border security for tRump.  This is about his insatiable ego.  Nothing more.

Ever notice the fences an walls around the White House.. they keep most people out.
Proud of the President and his stand!
Your promise was a wall that not the us paid for but Mexico if you are worried about promises!!!
Adam Ben Mexico will pay, think about it. ..its gonna cost them when that wall goes up....
We met a man visiting from Nigeria. He said we have President Trump to stand firm for us. We also met an American citizen who came here from Russia at 18 who had nothing but praise for President Trump and took time from her job to discuss socialism. She is against it!
Trump said Mexico was paying for the wall !
No we don't want border security we love vacationing in Mexico
The Dems are instigators and will stop at nothing to protest that President Trump is OUR President! They would rather the country fail, than support him! Their ultimate agenda is to bring this country to Socialism!
They will always fail in all their evil vices as we are confident in victory of good over evil
Thank you for accepting the weight and burden of your commitment not only to We The People, but to the citizens of the world, POTUS Trump. You and your family are role models and heroic to all of us. Some people and generations won't understand in this lifetime. But the hands of time will tell of your sacrifice. Thank you.
Any country but America... build the wall..
If only you would quit making the statement that the wall is effective border security.  Democrats are smart enough not to want a useless wall.  They want modern and cost effective security measures. The fact that the wall would eventually cost an estimated 70 billion is lost on trumpsters.  There is also the problem that some of the proposed border land is owned by private citizens and would have to be acquired by eminent domain.  Another issue is that much of the land is mountains or water and would be hard to construct on.  Finally ... Mexico was supposed to pay for it!  Border security yes.  Wall, NO!
Your promise that Mexico will fund the wall. Not us. Gtfo
Your promise was a wall that not the us paid for but Mexico if you are worried about promises!!!
I have a question for all my friends. I don‚Äôt care whether your Republicans or Democrats. Why do we send our American soldiers that spill their blood to protect the borders of other countries but we can‚Äôt spend the money for a wall to protect our Great Nation.Is blood not more precious than money?
I've seen so many Democrats say they don't want the wall, but they do want border security.  Or Democrats that proudly support Obama and Hillary, without realising both Obama and Hillary voted and set aside billions to have a wall built too.  It's mind boggling...
I say just do what you have to do President Trump to get the wall built. We support you but please freeze the salaries of those in Congress who are the decission makers.
They don‚Äôt want to stop their illegal immigrants voting for The Dums or Dems
Yes we do. Our homes, our country!
And I'm one of the number yes and I'm one of the numbers
Stopping you is more important for Democrats. Remember, the status quo benefits them.
Keep up the great work your doing President DONALD J TRUMP AMERICA is behind you and let build the damn wall and stop this invasion with any means necessary for the people of the USA. TRUMP 2020
Your promise that Mexico will fund the wall. Not us. Gtfo
From what I'm gathering from posts, is that Americans want protection, but not a wall. Is there another solution?
Walls work... See ‚ÄúSan Diego‚Äôs wall‚Äù before and after... NitwitsüôÑ
Secure our borders no matter what
It‚Äôs your memorial not border security, if you‚Äôre so worried about illegals getting benefits not given to homeless take the 5 billion you want to waste on a wall & help the homeless
With all due respect, Mr. President, why do you have to furlough workers who are doing the jobs they are expected to do, not pay them and put them in dire straits with their mortgages and taking care of their families until this gets straightened out.   If you need this wall and it's the only solution you see, I hope and pray you and the Democrats can sit down and resolve this, but please restore the pay to those depending on it that are caught in the crosshairs of this crisis.  They have not done anything to deserve this and are scared/stressed and worried sick.  Thank you for your consideration.
57% are against building on the southern border.
Promise that Mexico is paying? Hilary in prison?
Build it! Hell the past 4 only talked about it!
When and which time did you think President trump is not the greatest President?
What ever happened to DACA? Too much empathy for you? Why must you make people suffer needlessly?

How do you compromise with someone that is taking shots at you?
Return fire.
When and which time did you think President trump is not the greatest President?
You just can‚Äôt reason with the Democrats when before you say a word they have stated they will not listen and they will block you
Went through the list almost every single person who express how hilarious America protecting its borders is using the üòÇ by reaction is..... a... you guessed it foreigner to the US
Just saying ...  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=322843754997484&id=143574282924433
Democrats don't believe in filling campaign promises.
President Trump, the Democrats say, let's fund the government now and then we will work on national security. Well, that is the same thing they said to President Ragen. He caved. They lied. Don't fall for their tricks.
Campaign promises got u elected.  We expect u to keep them.  Obviously those promises r just rhetoric to Dems.  Just like all of Obama‚Äôs empty promises.
TRUMP 2020.  Re elect that mother f@cker again!
Return fire.
Don‚Äôt Cave !!! We got your back. Thank you Mr President
What if individual STATES on the border begin to bypass the Feds and construct extensive RAZOR WIRE barriers? Then, the President could have troops and border control officials take it from there? BYPASS CONGRESS!
so when is Mexico paying for it..part of your promise
Stay strong, hold steady!!!  We want that wall.
Yes, most Americans want border security. However, most Americans don‚Äôt want a physical wall. Get out of your own way and stop manufacturing crises.
I will build a great wall ‚Äî and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me ‚Äî and I‚Äôll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.‚Äù
Also the go fund me donations show it
Stop depending on the democrats they do not give 2 shits about the Americans or you do what we the people want build that wall declare üö® emergency
True America s want borders and protection!!!
Build  that  Wall and  veto,veto,veto play  the  same  game  they  do.
Building walls has never solved any problems.
Keep working hard for We The People Donald J. Trump!!! We Appreciate everything you do for our beautiful country!
If the government shutdown were affecting the Senate and the House bottom line, you can bet something would be done. NOW!!!!! Because tomorrow, while others are NOT getting paid, they WILL BE PAID! ( they're the people don't need to be paid).   I'm glad Mr. PRESIDENT; that you're NOT KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD! !!!!!!
KEEP US AND OUR CHILDREN SAFE.
We know the answer to that and its not to support the country.
I think they want to impeach ‚Äúthe mother f&cker‚Äù.....seems pretty important to them and the rest of us too.
If Trump was for giving Democrats pay raises , they would oppose it.
Democrats started lead the HOUSE with obstructive intent against you, Mr President, and against the policy US government.  Their unfair destructive stance failed...and failed again. Bible said, in Proverbs 22:8,  "--Those who plant injustice will harvest disaster, and their reign of terror will come to an end---".
Listen to Trump....Im UK but please listen. He means well.
THANK GOD FOR TRUMP! FINALLY A PATRIOT IN OUR WH AGAIN! #KAG
America wants secure borders but not a wall that will cost billions but will not succeed in keeping people or drugs out? There are better and cheaper ways to secure the border. You promised a 2000 mile concrete wall paid by Mexico. Now you want steel fencing 234 miles paid by US. That isn‚Äôt even close to what you promised
Didn‚Äôt you have 2 years to do this when republicans held all levels of government ?
Chris Hanson he didn't use the nuclear option.  (To prevent democrats from using it as well.)  60%.  Never had it.  Nice play on words, though.  Perhaps you should read up on how things actually work.
He could have had his budget approved under the republicans.  This is just a tactic by him to entice fear into people

Liar, liar, pants on fire. There is more crime committed by US citizens than by immigrants, in every city in the US.
Joy Sudler Really ? They are citizens? We will always have crime, but why import it?
Federal workers on Furlough.....Do not give in.....Stand Strong Donald J. Trump Vets for Trump Why would you support someone not paying you.....hmmm.....That is because you are a true American and also served your country. Civilians have no concept of what freedom cost and want to whine about you or I not getting paid when in reality ,WE WILLINGLY go without pay because it is the right thing for the people and America first. We get our money back paid, they also do not know there are Emergency Relief funds available if you get bound up and need to get money, also when offered the job you sign a contract knowing you will work without pay if this happens. Americans want the freedoms United States provides as long as someone else is willing to provide them at no cost to them. They fear Gov. shutdown must be affecting their lives in some way because Democrats are telling them it is. Well it is, they are being led astray for open boarders, which is against our own countries laws to support. Another it is us We the people who care for the illegals. Our money , we earn for OUR Family is taken from us to care for them. The more that come into the country the more it cost and Democrats want more to come over 500,000. On average $18.00 a day per illegal in the country. Millions of dollars a day and more every day and Democrats say send them on,  our American Citizens will pay for more. Thank US the Democrat with your vote... Republicans did not want you. They wanted to put the American People FIRST. How RUDE....

Yes they want it.  Just not your kind of border security.  Hey can somebody talk some sense into this guy or find a better guy?  Try something human.
You know Democrats don‚Äôt care about Americans and they do not want to work for the good of the country.
Its about time we have a President that's not a politician but an advocate for the American people!
Too bad you didn't tackle this issue in January 2017. Instead you went along with that dolt Ryan  and tax cuts. Why not simply invoke Article 4 Section 4 of the Constitution?
The sad part they are trying to hurt you, terrible!!!
Your not worth the breath Kenneth McIntyre

I am So Happy with President Trump.  He is Amazing and is working, tirelessly, for the American People.
Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth‚Äù, is a law of propaganda often attributed to the Nazi Joseph Goebbels. Among psychologists something like this known as the "illusion of truth" effect. But part of guarding against the illusion is the obligation it puts on us to stop repeating falsehoods. We live in a world where the facts matter, and should matter. If you repeat things without bothering to check if they are true, you are helping to make a world where lies and truth are easier to confuse. So, please, think before you repeat.http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161026-how-liars-create-the-illusion-of-truth
I support President Trump !!! Build the wall !!!
Donald J. Trump... I don‚Äôt understand the mentality in Washington ....the people of Capital Hill often choose party over people... they obstruct good things for America simply because the other party has their candidate in the White House or a majority in Congress... it all about power to them... drain the swamp Mr President... we want successors in Washington more concerned about the good of America over their political beliefs... often times when we replace someone in Washington... that person is also well indoctrinated in his or her view of legalism whether it be to the right or left...
Get the federal employees back to work and paid .... we will get the barrier for sure along with DACA plan and all other immigration
You are not working together with anyone on anything.
BUILD THAT WALL Mr. President, who cares what the DemonCratz think or want. You have kept all your other Campaign Promises thus far and We the People deserve Protection for our Country. Sir Thank You for Leading this Country. No telling what HildaBeast would have done to America Only GOD knows and He gave America Trump!
No they don‚Äôt you do !! All we want to impeach you
All Americans want border security. Stop lying !!  A wall stops animals not people.   Open the government and start compromising.
Reggie James Your facts are swayed when it comes to the orange monster!!.
That much money can go on more important things.
America's Southern Defense Barrier!!! Build it!!!!
I'm a South African and I fully support President Donald J Trump he is the best President America has ever had in my opinion all he wants is for American to be safe and secure why is that so hard to comprehend MAGA VIVA PRESIDENT TRUMP don't settle get the money for the wall and build it majority Americans r 100%  with u
Stand Strong Mr President! America is behind you!
Democrats are ready to give away $25+ Billion in foreign aid but don't want to authorize $5 billion for America's border security. Tell Chuck and Nancy to end the #DemocratShutdown now!

How about working together?  As soon as that check from Mexico clears.
Didn't you promise that mexico was going to pay for it? Is that what you mean?
There is no national emergency along the southern border. Both DHS and US State Department disputes your facts. Delusional.

Joe, can you please do something about the people you know who voted for Clinton / Obama? (Such as friends, family members, coworkers, neighbors, etc) Please make sure they do not screw up again and support another communist Democrat again.
Edward Dennis Toppe . Everyone that I know has voted for trump
Only reason Obama won..was because he ran against two morons. And their true colors have  been seen
Do more please....the friendly waitress at your local restaurant for example...make sure she does not vote Democrat....what about your neighbors, the mailman who comes to your home every day, etc.
Stopping you, being offensive to half their fellow Americans,  spouting hateful foul comments, demeaning our government, and that is exactly it
From Egypt I say..build the wall mr president Trump...wish we in Egypt had enough money to build a similar wall in the Sinai border to keep the terrorist Hamas moslem brotherhood out of our country.
Stop dividing the country. Start being a leader. Start working on real policies that fix the real issues. Please. Democrats aren‚Äôt the problem. This derisiveness, us versus them, pitting each other against each other is the problem. You were elected to serve ALL of the people of this nation. Not just the ones who yell the loudest.
What is wrong with them?  They dont care about us, that's for sure!  Thank you President Trump for caring!!!

To the Federal Employees that are furloughed ‚Äî Welcome to the real world!  Been working in industry as a mechanical engineer since 1979. Myself and damn few of my peers have a pension or are even eligible for one.  The smart ones have IRA‚Äôs, 401K‚Äôs and personal investments we have sacrificed to make.   We have been furloughed, laid off and terminated due to poor business decisions, smart business decisions, Federal Reserve policies, Federal and State rules, regulations or legislation.  We‚Äôve been done in by simple economic downturn cycles.  Most of the people I know my age of 55+ or older are working simply for health insurance until Medicare Kicks in.  Most of us have reached the point where we would really rather be doing something else to make ends meet but we need health insurance.  I‚Äôll be working for health insurance until I‚Äôm 67 to keep my wife covered until Medicare.  Oh you think universal health care is the solution? Pass it and see how fast my taxable income heads down.   Those of us that have chosen the management or self employment route have worked long unpaid hours, days, weeks, months.  So stop whining, we‚Äôve been there multiple times before, we‚Äôve started over multiple times.  Life happens and there are no guarantees in life, even though the Federal employees I currently work with seem to think there are, there really aren‚Äôt.  Thing is I have yet to miss a government minion.  So keep her shutdown and kick some ass tonight President Trump.
Diane Dodge honey I will and YOU are in a minority.  Check the polls

Declaring a state of emergency at our borders will free up the money to build the wall. LET'S GO!
The only thing important to DemTerrorists, is the destruction of our way of life, Christianity, and our constitution.
What promises have you filled what have you done for us nothing !!!! But devide us hold our people hostage
I back trump. But not happy with asking us to pay for the wall when his whole platform was that Mexico was paying.
What if I tell you, you can have border security without a wall???? Mind blown!!!!
We will back your play Mr. President!
After 9/11, we all said we would Never Forget!  Well, I think too many have forgotten.
hi Mr. President, ask Nancy and Chuckie to join you at the border Thrusday when you go. When was the last time they went there to see for themselves first hand.  Stay strong,sir. God Bless. fr. sue

Build the wall!  Stand firm Mr President!  MAGA
Build it of American steel then solar/electrify it
Don‚Äôt the Democrats have any agendas that they can be working on?  What about the roads in Cleveland and Political Finacial waste on every level?
Stay strong, never give up! Build those walls!
Secure our borders but also get people back to work
Stopping you from fulfilling the promises.
we want you to be fiscally responsible act presidential and stop demonizing those who are not your base.... stop selling our lands, stop screwing up our environment, create green jobs, and stop lying
Well of course, if Fox News said it, I'm in. Psych.
Please fulfill your promise. MAKE MEXICO PAY FOR THE WALL !
Would be great if could be on a voting ballot in each state, just like an election.
It‚Äôs crazy that an entire political party is arguing AGAINST safety for the American People! ü§® Unreal.
I fully support Border Security BUT we US CITIZENS would also like to be able to get back to work and get PAID! Penalizing Government workers shouldn‚Äôt go hand in hand with getting border security. Also let me say while yes we typically get backpay once we are allowed to go back to work it‚Äôs not 100% guaranteed so this is not a ‚Äúpaid vacation‚Äù nor do our creditors care that we are furloughed and may quite possibly fall behind on our payments. Savings for some but not all may carry us over but unfortunately not everyone has that ability financially.
They want to stop you at all costs. Damn the consequences. Build that wall sir!
Stay strong President Trump! #MAGA Secure our borders...build the wall!
Need the wall to facilitate SAFTY for our citizens
So obvious, Schumer and Pelosi, have their own agendas.  They are vindictive, and will go against anything President Trump wants to accomplish.  Build the wall!
So no wall I guess they can't stop when he ups the security.
What do conservatives say about the wall? https://medium.com/@vickyalvearshecter/what-happened-when-a-trump-supporter-challenged-me-about-the-wall-e54e86a5edd1
You promised the Mexicans were going to pay!
Please fulfill your promise. MAKE MEXICO PAY FOR THE WALL !
$5,700,000,000 for the wall √∑ 327,160,000 Adults in the U.S.A  = $17.42 per adult.  Democrats are seriously upset over this?
Well, tRump is right about running the country like his businesses: it's failing, shut down and none of his employees are being paid.
Thank you mr. President for caring about Americans first.
They don‚Äôt give a crap about Americans if they cared they give their paychecks to veterans like you GIve your paycheck to the veterans and other groups in the countries that need it!
PLEASE MR PRESIDENT...,,FIND A WAY TO SAVE US FTOM THOSE 2 INSUFFERABLE TOOLS!
Stand strong Mr President, and secure our boarder.
Your promise was Mexico (not America) pays for wall.
Go President Trump, GO.  We love you.  You are strong, you love WE THE PEOPLE, you love and protect us and our soldiers, etc. etc.  We stand behind you and you will be in office for another term.  God Bless You.
You promised the Mexicans were going to pay!
" I will own this shut down" "Mexico will pay for the wall" "I'm bringing our troops home" " our troops will get a 10% pay raise"When will the lies end?
President Trump, we are proud of what you are doing.  Don't quit!  The media will never tell the truth but you do!  Thank you!
Listen to flip flop Chuck  https://www.facebook.com/PatriotRichardGarcia/videos/288855465313119/
The Dems..  1. Wish to abolish ICE; 2. Rejected Kate's law; 3. Run 'Sanctuary' cities; 4. Rejected Criminal Gang Removal Act; 5. Reject a Border Wall....  Yet, most Dems live in walled properties which ordinary Americans do not.
Allowing the killing of unborn babies and impeaching the President are the two top chores on their list.  Working FOR Americans is not even in the top 20..üò°
It's not about you fulfilling any promise, they want their voter base flooding the country.
Omfg wall is not gonna solve anything. Here tackle two birds with one stone.  Hire more foot patrol and use modern technology like drones and pilots to man them omfg.....job creation and border security all in one........
Declare national security and build the wall before government restart.

American's want Hillary in prison and the US to stop playing sugar-daddy to every shyster country on the planet. But none of that seems to be happening.  PS: they also want the goddamn swamp drained, not re-arranged.

What are you all so scared of ? Waist of money, waist of time. Irrational fear!
Stephanie Collarile what a brain-dead moron what are we so afraid of if you weren't an uninformed liberal idiot you would know the answer to that
90% of the deadly fentanyl laced heroin comes over the southern border you dumped with how about that for starters
David Criola but it's proven that it comes through ports of entry .. not people walking across the boarder illegally . Irrational fear, backed by far from the truth statement .
Nancy Pelosis number 202-225-4965 Chuck Schumer‚Äôs number 202-224-7433 Be polite but EVERYONE call and get your family and friends to call and demand funding for the wall! Crash the phone lines until they understand what the American People Want!!!
Do what is needed.  I also keep seeing posts about you planning on,getting rid of the Wildlife , Do you even know how important Wolves ARE to our Eco Systems‚ùì Have you even done a study of wildlife in Yellowstone before the Wolves were removed & what happened after they were put back into our wildlife ‚ùì‚ùì Please do some research , some homework before any unnecessary plans are made to remove what belongs!! Please LOOK UP ~ CENTER FOR  BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. Make the right decisions on an Education about Wolves first _ their role in Nature. Thank you from Oklahoma Be Educated on,any decisions
Ha Ha ha ha... Trump would be funny if he weren't so pathetic
Build a bunch of Army forts along the border and let the military do the surveillance
I want immigration reform more than a wall.  I support President Trump but think if the immigration process was run more efficiently, less people would come in illegally.  I know someone personally who is married to a man from Mexico.  She has been for 5 years.  They cannot live together because after over $20,000 and stacks of paperwork, he is still in Mexico due to a filing error that was not their fault.  She has her PhD and still cannot seem to get through all of the red tape.  He is trying to do the right thing but red tape is making it extremely difficult.  Fix the problems with the process first, please.  Families are suffering.
Facts that scare trolls... https://www.whitehouse.gov/trump-administration-accomplishments/

How much does it cost not to have a wall? There is one!

Please Mr President, show Mrs May how to honour and love her country üá¨üáß as much as you honour and love yours üá∫üá∏. I love my country üá¨üáß yet she is about to let the ‚ÄòEU wolves‚Äô continue to control and dominate it.
I heard antifa has been in Mexico coaching those people what to say and they have been bulling the natives. Oh and there are antifa lawyers to
The American citizens have to be the number one priority. Build the wall!!!!
Lower the food stamp amount given to all southern border illegal and Medicaid
I think we all know the answer.
Most communities in the southern states are gated communities at least for upper middle class. So what is the big deal with it at the southern border
President Mr. Donald Trump is not saying that you don't come to USA.He is saying that come legally with documents.His point is an extremely correct that human trafficking, child abuse and drug dealings are happening through open border.people should go to LA and should visit million homeless people there.I request to Mr. Trump that he must revoke country quota based green card and give green card to people who are talented, educated, can take care themselves and are in Q for employment based green card for long time.Poor should also allow to come through green card.
Trump 2020. Declare National Emergency. Build the wall.
How much does it cost not to have a wall? There is one!
Great speech!  I would have been happier with you announcing that you were going to reopen the government and declaring an emergency and take the money to build the wall!  Don't give in.
Stopping You which makes them an Enemy to us Americans! Dems are getting scarier by the day!
Donald, I am a normal every day American, trian me to help protect our border until our wall is built. I will stand there proudly protecting my children's future.
Then go above them..build that wall..they went above the people and hid it
No wall. Border security, yes.Get it through your head.
More material for SNL.  Normally, that would be a good thing.
fox news is the biggest inaccurate news............
Father God, have Your way.  You bless those who bless Israel.  Stand in the path and stop this attack on the sovereignty of the USA and ISRAEL!  TY, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH.

No one is responsible for this shut down by President Trump he is on tape saying that he would take the responsibility what else do you need as proof that this man is a jack ass
We want border security, but that doesn't mean we want a "wall". We are not East Berlin.
Who's going to pay for the wall ? Everybody repeat it again ,How did it go ? ...ya
if it‚Äôs fox news it‚Äôs a lie even true things once reported by fox news become lies
Even the ultra conservative Cato Institute thinks the wall is a taxpayer scam.  The wall will not stop drugs per their study.   https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-wall-wont-work

54% of americans are telling you no to the wall
Mr. President, what‚Äôs important for Democrats is to take revenge for crooked Hillary‚Äôs loss in the election.
You are exactly right!  Why would they not want a wall built???  Theres no other reason!!  You are right!! That is the only reason they refuse to pass the Wall. They wanted it before when a democratic president was in office. But now that a Republican is in they won‚Äôt agree! Thank you for standing FIRM!  So Thankful for you and what you are doing for our country! Keep up the good work and don‚Äôt back down to them !
I am so tired of people talking bad about you. What gives Bernie Sanders the right to call u a liar. I love having u as our President and will be glad when everyone starts showing u respect.
Dont give in to the devil. Stand your ground please
Yes it‚Äôs one of the reasons there isn‚Äôt a Democrat President
Yes Americans want a Border Wall,   but the unAmericas so called DEMOCRATS  don't.   So PLEASE Build the Wall Mr. PRESIDENT TRUMP for us Americas that Respect YOU !!
Yes sir, "we the people" WANT THE WALL!! Stand firm, you are the President of the people! Send all of the Natinal guard down there and get it done!üí™üòé
I love and support my President ! Trump2020
You have many supporters here that are on your side. Build the wall President Trump. Don't give up on your promises.
Wonder why the Networks are so keen not to televise your wall speech? To much truth in one spot?
https://www.naturalnews.com/2019-01-08-it-begins-president-trump-likely-to-declare-national-emergency-at-9pm-today.html  Go President Trump!
Seems to be their focus as opposed to doing the job they were hired to do.
Your promise was to have Mexico pay for this damn wall. You yourself are failing on your promise. Your pride is failing the people who work for you.
Build the wall .. this is probably the least amount of money we have ever fought over for that dose good
Americans like my wife (a federal employee for over 20 years) want to go back to work! But your childish behavior and continued shutdown of the government is preventing her from doing that.  Reopen the government and fight for your damn wall on your own dime.  #trumpshutdown
Mr. Trump don‚Äôt give in to the democrats,built that wall. You gave a great speech today. You presented plenty of examples as to why we need the wall.  Just the fact that Americans are dying in the hands of illegals which it shouldn‚Äôt happen, is good enough for me. build that wall.
Drones will just fly over wall with you know what!
Maybe you can stop their pay and pay everyone else so we don‚Äôt lose everything we have worked so hard for!! I bet they would change their mind real quick like!!! I voted for you and support you 100%!! Please take their paycheck and not ours!!! Go Trump!!!
Yes sir, "we the people" WANT THE WALL!! Stand firm, you are the President of the people! Send all of the Natinal guard down there and get it done!üí™üòé
Sadly it's to see you fail Mr President..
Just out of curiosity, will the wall cover both the southern and the northern borders or is Canada fine with no wall?
More important to Dems that you don‚Äôt succeed than our national security.
100% support our president on the wall and he has my support in 2020 keep America Great
Cut  the  cost,,  have  inmates  do  some  of  the  work,,
Border security is of the utmost importance.
Stopping you from succeeding at anything is their priority. They are not effective, they can't get anything worth while accomplished and they are angry and jealous. They do not want you to be the one that goes down in history for making this happen.
President Trump don't give in to them the Democrats have gone to far we need the wall. Most of my friends and others agree it is time to stand up to these Democrats.
Grandma Nancy is worth $200 million you think she will care if you stop her pay check.  It won‚Äôt hurt her or a lot of the upper Senate people Chucky May mind as he is only worth $900,000 but still can pay his bills
America please wake up don't build a wall... Build two of the fuckers and protect what's yours much love from the UK
Maybe you can stop their pay and pay everyone else so we don‚Äôt lose everything we have worked so hard for!! I bet they would change their mind real quick like!!! I voted for you and support you 100%!! Please take their paycheck and not ours!!! Go Trump!!!
What‚Äôs more important to Trump? Building a wall or securing the border and running a country?
Build it now and start deportations in mass by bus, train, plane, boat, by mule or what ever way they can be carried back.
Stopping you POTUS is their ONLY agenda. Tell the world ALL of their dirty little secrets!
We‚Äôve got your back, Mr. President!
That's a given...take him out-no matter the cost.
Build the wall.  Crisis over. Easy. Nancy you get it?  Chunky ???
Every thing needs an upgrade even Nancy's  plastic surgeon knows that
I don't care if they never restart the government...bunch of democratic communist.....get out... Trump build that wall  Build that WALL TRUMP BUILD THAT DAMN WALL
I know, right?  Democrats need to show up and grow up. Keep the pressure on. Its a deep wound for them.

Let's have an official special issue vote for the border wall at local election sites.  Only those who can prove they were born in the U.S., or are legal citizens may vote.  No fake polls or rigged election.  No mail in ballots, or dead people voting.  Let's find out how many Americans support our President and really want this southern border barrier built.  If the public says to fund it, then the Congress MUST fund it.  My guess is that at least 3/4 of the whole population want the wall built.  Democrats are afraid of the truth!
James Jerome   Apparently, you're getting your numbers from the same place Trump is, OUT YOUR ASS!
James Jerome the only ones that got caught rigging elections were rep in the carolina election
Tom Caskey Awww - did I trigger a liberal who slaps back with a huge informal fallacy.  I didn't provide any "numbers" as facts.  I said, "my guess" which is clearly an opinion.  I proposed a vote be taken to find out how many people really support the wall.  You must be one of those Democrats who are afraid of the truth.  You talk loudest, and think that means you are in the majority.  üòÜüòÖüòÇü§£
Larry Favre - I didn't mention rigged elections to point fingers, or go off on a red herring tangent.  There has been plenty of evidence of elections being "rigged" across the country, and likely even more that has gone undetected.  That was not the point of my proposal.  ASK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC directly, and stop relying on whether the President, or Congress thinks it is a good idea.  After all, they ALL work for us - - so IF the majority actually want the wall, then the debate would be over, and they should fund it.  IF the majority does not want the wall, then those who do can find ways to fund it without Congress.  Either way, crossing the border must be done legally, so who is in favor of enforcing our laws on entering the United States?  Let's not be afraid of the truth!

Just bypass these crooks. Violating oaths of office. Build the wall.
1) Filling there bank accounts  2) Stopping Trump 3) Ruin America
Well wasn't part of the promise Mexico would pay?
What's that baaa noise I hear? All the  brainless Trump supporters following him like sheep üòÇüòÇüêëüêë
D.C. (both parties) want to shut down any and everything an 'outsider' does so noone with the money to run for pres ever tries again.  Not part of the club .  Trump was a Democrat before he ran for pres...remember that.
Don't waste anymore time with these obstructionists. They only want power & airtime oh wait, that's all politicians. Somebody just do something. This is getting very old.
Audit the feds now
Stand your Ground ! Keep America safe Mr. President üá∫üá∏
Stopping you! With hopes you won‚Äôt run in 2020.
Hold the line Mr. President!  The American people have faith in you!
Why can't 45 compromise and get the government employees back to work and get a portion of the 5.7 billion....break it down into getting part of the wall started  and more boots on the ground. Use more technology for surveillance etc. The Mexican government need to crack down on the people who are growing crops and making heroin. The Mexican govt. did virtually nothing to stop the caravan. As a matter of fact, they assisted them.
I know I want border security   Stay strong Mr President
Stopping you from fulfilling a promise
They could care less about our country,  if  you told them you were against the wall they would of wanted a golden wall.  Build that wall President Trump,  the AMERICANS will appreciate it.
Democrats care about illegals more then citizens. Truth.
Hold your ground Mr. President, let the shutdown in place until you get every last cent of the proposed 5.7 billion you requested.  The democratic learches have sucked enough blood out of the American taxpayer for nothing projects during the Obama administration, and its time for us to do the right thing.  BUILD THE BARRIER.
WE THE PEOPLE WANT THE WALL....we stand behide you ALL the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We are all with you Mr. President 100%
Don't waste anymore time with these obstructionists. They only want power & airtime oh wait, that's all politicians. Somebody just do something. This is getting very old.
The amazing thing is that they will try to stop you until 2025 just so they can be the ones to build the wall.  Their foolishness is illuminated for all to see.
Per an IG audit,  Accenture Federal Services was paid by CBP $13.6 million of a $297 million contract to recruit and hire 7500 applicants.  They hired 2.  Not to mention, the parent company is Accenture incorporated in Dublin Ireland.  So taxpayer money is going to a contractor who did not live up to the terms of the contract and is not even owned by an American company.  How is this an America first policy?
I'm fairly certain he keeps talking about this wall because it's one of the only words he and his FOLLOWERS know how to spell without any help.....
Still waiting for that "better insurance coverage for less money" the "great negotiator" PROMISED during the campaign..... I guess Mexico is paying for that too
Why without illegal votes how would the Democrats ever win elections!????? There are only so many deceased votes one can win without raising eyebrows!! Build the damn wall please
please keep meetings with Nancy & Chuck on camera so they show there true evil colors
I would share my plan with you to fix the government, but you don't pay me enough.
Just A few weeks ago democrats and the liberal news were quoted saying there was a crisis at the border when the young girl died... today they say it's a made up crisis... hmmm...I guess they forgot who made it up.... maybe they should go on air and tell everyone they lied instead of saying Trump is lying about it... he's just agreeing with them and trying to solve the problem. Funny how short their memories are when they want to lie about things.
The time is now. Do not fumble the ball. It is on 10 yard line and ready to be thrown into the end zone. Loyalty.

Do what ever it takes, but please get it done.
huge difference between boarder security and a wall...
Yes we do!!!! Thank you for protecting us!!!! Praying for you Mr. President, always.
The border wall is a good start let alone 11 million illegal immigrants using falsified Social Security numbers which is a felon to u.s. citizens
Give it to God. If it‚Äôs Gods will for the wall to be built it will. God is more powerful than anyone or anything.  Matthew 19:26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. Amen
Congress wants to spend $55 billion on foreign aid but refuses to spend $5.4 billion on border security. Let that sink in real good.
I saw a Meme that said Build the WALL on the Mexico side and call it Foreign Aid ..Good Idea <3
Build the wall, make sure it's got electricity, make a moat filled with crocodiles... lol they all seem to forget Obama shut down the government to push his bs Obamacare..
Carol Osborn Nope, just responding to idiots.

The promise was , Mexico is gonna pay for it
Bullshit
Wish it had been longer and that some of the border security people had talked about the dangers they face every day and what t's like at the border.  Trump did a good job tho.  That wall must be built.
Congress works for their district. Not all districts want the wall. They are doing their jobs. You just dont agree with their sides. But the president is not doing his job by putting a federal freeze.
You promised to make Mexico pay, not us...
No, we don't. We want you out of office!
We are with you President Trump.
They are just afraid their future voters won't be able to sneak into the US..
Your kind calling them democrats, Mr. President I call them DEMOBRATS.
Your promise wasn't we'd pay for it.
I‚Äôm in for the original plan, Mexico writes the check, then we build.
Trump could build cities on the moon and the Democrats would still only be there to  say no
Bullshit
Trump could build cities on the moon and the Democrats would still only be there to  say no
I'm truly sick of hearing about it. Live up to your word...üòé

They hate Trump so much that they oppose anything he tries to do even when they know it's a good thing to do. If Obama or Hilary wanted a wall, they and all the Americans on the same bandwagon would agree.
You said Mexico would pay, not us! Plus you‚Äôre making the very people that voted for you, believed and supported you, pay for the wall! Not to mention the people that believed in and voted for you are going to lose their homes, the lives they built, and their families just so you can get your way over empty promises!
What about the promise that Mexico was paying? Isn't that part of the promise you made? Lol
call Pelosi @ 202-225-4965 & Schumer @ 202-224-7433. blow up their answering service demanding the wall.
Your promise was Mexico was paying for the wall....ah hem.
Stay strong! We support making America safe!
I wander the same thing but also would like to know okay say you get your wall then then are not re-elected and the next president says "No Wall' then what?
I'm pretty sure a highly raised go fund me reflects that...
Chuck Ellis. We're all fighting the Dems
Past presidents and the border wall   http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/latest-trump-lie-discredited-several-former-us-presidents
BOTH. Stopping you from fulfilling your promise AND providing funding for BETTER methods to secure the border.
I wish there was a ‚Äúpants on fire‚Äù emoji.
Stopping you is all they seem to care about. Let the facts put the American people at ease. The dumb media, which I now call, Paid Actors Of TV seem to leave out pertinent information when reporting what‚Äôs going on in the world. Someone needs to step in and fine then for everything they say that is inaccurate. When they advertise that people won‚Äôt get their income taxes and food stamps, they need to share ALL of the information. Is it possible? Sure, but not likely.
Yeah.. we want border security. Not a wall.
Unfortunately, the Pelosi/Schumer "Illegals First" campaign cares less about United States citizens!!  BUILD THAT WALL Mr. President!!
You don't want security at the border, you want a monument with your name on it. That's all you've ever wanted, and when you asked for Rushmore the country told you to go sh*t in your hat. Well, you can go get ready for round 2.
Americans ? Who cares about Americans ? üò≠üò≠üò≠
I'm pretty sure a highly raised go fund me reflects that...
the don proving he does;t care about the security of the u.s , do you really think your fooling us lmao
Democrats Need The Votes !!!! BUILD THE WALL !!!!!!
Or are you keeping all of the money?
KARMA in time will get them. Mr. President you are still a winner. They are the losers. Big time.
So sad! I am embarrassed for living in the State of California. We elect the worst politicians. Please forgive Pelosi Mr. President Donald J. Trump-as Jesus said on the cross, "Father, forgive them for they no not what they do." Hang Strong President Donald J. Trump!!
I'm not sure a wall is the answer. Stop all the free stuff and that would stop a lot. Americans are struggling. We can't keep supporting people coming in
Secure our borders!!!! Keep America safe.
The Democrats want open borders so they can get all the illegals‚Äô votes so they can stay in power forever!!!!
Reopen the government and fund Fema you ass
Americans ? Who cares about Americans ? üò≠üò≠üò≠

So is the Canadian border next?  Walls don‚Äôt stop anything.
sorry, i meant to say, WALL, please.
Meanwhile, the rest of the World watches the collapse of a once admired country...It will take a long time to recover.
people want rule of law, not dimplomatic immunity for whoever wanders in...
Let the people vote, we want the wall!!
legalize cannabis it will build whatever you want from the profits!!  lol
Yes We DO want Border security!!
Trump is exposing communism in New Mexico and in California

Love our president! Trump I know you will stand your ground! After all you are a business man not a politician ! Thank god your not. Build the wall
Senators shouldn't get payed until this problem is solved period
You just want another structure to put your name on..
Build the WALL  forget schumer and Pelosi, they're not true Americans
Your promise was Mexico would fund a border wall. Asking American tax payers to fund it is NOT fulfilling your promise.
Please don‚Äôt hold your breath for the wall you will suffocate nana Pelosi will not allow it to be built
That is what it is all about what you want your ego cannot stand to be told no
how about a Land Mine Field then people will think twice before crossing illegaly either way over the border
Payo Trevino are you really from america??you sound like an Arab
how about a Land Mine Field then people will think twice before crossing illegaly either way over the border
That is what it is all about what you want your ego cannot stand to be told no
Sadly they care more about trying to take you down
Keep it shutdown, until they pull their heads out!
Please ask Congress to waive their monthly salaries for those that depend on their federal paycheck and support!!!

There is probably 2 guns in every house in America and you are telling me American. Are still frightened of the boogeyman
Matthew 25 31‚ÄúWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32.All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33.He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 34.‚ÄúThen the King will say to those on his right, ‚ÄòCome, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35.For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36.I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.‚Äô 37.‚ÄúThen the righteous will answer him, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38.When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39.When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?‚Äô 40.‚ÄúThe King will reply, ‚ÄòTruly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.‚Äô 41.‚ÄúThen he will say to those on his left, ‚ÄòDepart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42.For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43.I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.‚Äô 44.‚ÄúThey also will answer, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?‚Äô 45.‚ÄúHe will reply, ‚ÄòTruly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.‚Äô 46.‚ÄúThen they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.‚Äù
Duh, obviously stopping you even if it destroys the country.

Call Schumer 202-224-6542 and Pelosi 202-225-4965 tomorrow and ask them to "FUND THE WALL" (Be POLITE)
God bless you, Mr. President! Thank you for stating the facts. Facts that Dumbocrats continue to ignore due to their lack of maturity and temper tantrums.
ridiculous....how can dems think the wall is a bad idea when they see what's on the other side?? Stand your ground, and as far as the shutdown goes...we have too many people working in government and cutting some will help with everyone's taxes....let it ride
The Democrats are Desperate to save their socialist communist agenda to take over the USA , and they know they must have open borders with all the world flooding in here to be their supporters and  to get enough votes to win an stay in Power which is all they care about an I REPEAT , WHICH IS ALL THEY CARE ABOUT.
Sure tells us just the kind of people they are !
We should probably try to strengthen America, before building the wall, people with money are so ass backwards.
Build the wall President Trump it will stop the drugs and protect Americans From illegalsüòç

The problem at the border has been in existence for decades they continue to kick the can down the road because it's a way to get the votes.  Thanks for taking on the problem, it's the politicians more than the border since everyone's in agreement that we need to have a barrier anyway.  The American people are with you!
Right it's totally the Democrats fault you're failing to fulfill your promise of making Mexico pay for the wall.
It was not even a month ago you said ‚ÄúI am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck. ‚Ä¶ I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I‚Äôm not going to blame you for it.‚Äù  Your promise was that we would not pay a dime for the wall.  Now you shut down the government, and are costing us more money every minute, to take our tax money for the wall we aren't supposed to have to pay for!
Agreed!!!!  Do What the people WANT!!!!!!
Build the wall!  Thank you President Trump for caring about us enough to protect us.  We Love you and your family. May the God of Israel always guide and protect you in Jesus Name.
Clean house it's about time don't people realize that this is what he has to do to get people to pay attention United we stand he is doing what's right they are not

You see everything as a polarized problem, where there is one "right" and one "wrong".    That's so far from the truth on this issue
BUILD THE WALL !!!!  We have been donating to the Veteran's Fund The Wall- Go Fund Me..every little bit helps!!
They are digging their own grave and don't know it
Stay strong, President Trump!
Keep fighting the loonies Mr. Trump
That I recall, just before you shut down part of the government there was a bipartisan immigration bill presented to you that covers border security. This mess would have been resolved weeks ago with your signature. So tell me again how that is the Democrats' fault.
I do think if you aren‚Äôt paying the non essential workers congress the house the president none of you should be getting paid either
Yes if you are trying to full fill said promise on lies. Try integrity it does a body good.
See you just said it... Democrats have no issue with funding for border security but they aren't going to fund your wall. So you just agreed to the funds for border security.

When Nancy made that comment about it‚Äôs a campaign promise as if campaign promises are just words that aren‚Äôt meant to be followed up on and not wanting to speak on camera,   well that to me said a lot about career politicians.
Build the Wall. How about having everyone donate and get a brick with their name on it. I would donate if I knew it was going for the wall.
You had a bipartisan bill that you were going to sign until you listened to Ann Coulter and russ l, the people in office were voted in by the people, those people who you are supposed top listen to not Ann Coulter who the hell is she anyway I didn't see her on any ballot
wish we had a decent one who helped the people , more and more stabbing shootings liquidations more and more stealing and our prime minister just say come on in open borders here!
The democratic leaders/ socialists do not care about the American people. I have seen it after watching Schumer and pelosi speak. It‚Äôs sad that people who have no interest in preserving our values and constitution have been elected to represent the us.
You should make it a law that no media/news outlet can share false news. It does nothing but cause anger and hatred in our country. I have had enough with all these news outlets just lying nonstop.
You are so obsessed with this wall, you are forgetting about US! You are neglecting the people that have NO JOB right now because of YOUR pettiness! What ABOUT US? The American People!? You are putting WORKING Americans at risk with your foolish games right now!
I love you President Donald Trump!
Build that wall!   President Trump I stand strong with you all the way you are doing what I voted you in to do Thank you  President Trump
Brent Congdon Probably any USA airport! Good luck!

"I promise,  MEXICO is paying for the wall..."
How do you figure?
I love you President Donald Trump!
Yes and the ‚Äúpromise‚Äù was to make Mexico pay not the American taxpayers. Liar, traitor, President Pinocchio ü§•
Albert kojo kyekye We all agree with you here in Long Island,New York
Healthcare? If you want to call a national emergency on something or anything, why not start with healthcare?
Don't forget the MSM working for them!
So what's that wall gonna be good for again?
Yes we do want Border Security.  You have my vote 2020 President Trump
A link to a Fox News article? I'm not sure what's the biggest joke here
Stay the course, Mr President!  We love you and support your position.  Please stay safe on your trip to the southern border.  Praying for you.
Exactly!!! It‚Äôs absolutely unbelievable and disgraceful!!!
How do you figure?
Build that wall! Shut the government down! Don‚Äôt give them any more chances to make a decision they are just gonna fight you no matter what.
Everyone not thinking a wall will work unlock your doors. These imagrents need a place to stay. And thanks for volunteering.
Its become more obvious everyday the democrats do not care for the American people, they are nothing but arrogant pathetic individuals. They have no message nor do they provide solutions. They can‚Äôt debate so they resort to hate.
You are right Mr. President ,,build the wall.
Build the wall! Supporting  you all the way. Praying
We need laws to fully end the bastardization of the Civil War amendments, ending birthright citizenship, ending chain migration, mandate e-Verify prosecuting non-compliant companies, demanding proof of citizenship for any federal benefits, and strong voter ID. Fast track deportation. We need the Wall but that will not be enough.
ü§£ü§£ü§£A former Border Patrol chief in the Obama administration who was removed by President Donald Trump joined the experts supporting a border wall.  Mark Morgan, a former FBI agent, served as Obama‚Äôs Border Patrol chief for most of 2016 and was asked to leave the position by the Trump administration in 2017.  Speaking on Jan. 7 during an appearance on Fox News‚Äô ‚ÄúTucker Carlson Tonight,‚Äù Morgan said that border walls ‚Äúabsolutely work.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf you look in the past, you don‚Äôt have to go too far back in history, that bipartisan legislation that was passed, the Secure Fence Act in 2006 and 2012, bipartisan legislation passed where they built the wall or fence or physical barrier, whatever you want to call it, it‚Äôs a wall. It works,‚Äù Morgan said.  Current Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were among those voting for the pieces of legislation Morgan mentioned.  Carlson noted that Morgan had been fired by Trump, which Morgan acknowledged before saying Trump was right about the wall.  ‚ÄúThe president is right, the president of [National] Border Control Council is right. The other day when they had the national press conference and they got up and they said, ‚ÄòThe wall works,‚Äô they‚Äôre right, and it‚Äôs not based on a personal, political ideology. That‚Äôs based on historical data and facts that can be proven,‚Äù Morgan said.  ‚ÄúI cannot think of a legitimate argument why anyone would not support the wall as part of a multi-layered border security issue,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt we listening to the experts and the people who do it every day? I don‚Äôt understand that.‚Äù  Trump‚Äôs opponents have taken to calling the wall ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù and ‚Äúineffective‚Äù but have put forth few counter-measures nor cited data supporting their arguments.  Trump border security President Donald Trump listens to Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, speak about border security in the briefing room at the White House in Washington, on Jan. 3, 2019. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) Trump invited experts to talk to the media about why a wall works and is necessary on Jan. 3. As Morgan noted, National Border Patrol Council members were among those speaking.  ‚ÄúAnywhere that you look where we have built walls, they have worked,‚Äù Brandon Judd, a border agent for 21 years and president of the council, told reporters. ‚ÄúThey have been an absolute necessity for Border Patrol agents in securing the border.‚Äù  Morgan‚Äôs comments came as President Trump was scheduled to give his first prime-time address to the nation on Tuesday night to address the crisis at the border.
üá∫üá∏ Thank You Mr. President üá∫üá∏ You are ‚ù§Ô∏è loved and appreciated!!!!!!
None of this is about a wall, immigration or whatever.  It's about making Trump look bad so they can win the white house in 2020.
I think we ALL know the answer to THAT question!
Exactly!!! It‚Äôs absolutely unbelievable and disgraceful!!!
The people are behind you.....drain the swamp.....build the wall.
Stopping you from another win. Thank you President Trump.
BUILD THAT WALL!  KEEP US SAFE! Who goes to bed in this day and time with their doors unlocked and open? BUILD THAT WALL! !!
Build the wall!! Nancy & Chuck have no intentions of building a wall!!
Wall won‚Äôt do it unless you mine the border as well.
Please come over Mr President and sort Brexit out for us. We have a bunch of self-serving idiots in government who are not up for the job.
Let‚Äôs hear more about that ‚Äúmantle‚Äù that you will hold lol üëçüèº

I call  bullshit It a political stunt to distract from all coming out your campaign and collusion Why would you then campaign manager give a Russian operative internal polling info
Michael Brian  At least it is Relevant Unlike  trumps broken record of Hilary Obama and the Dems
One says make America great again, the other says resist. Hmmmmm. Build the wall!!!!
Agree Mt President We have your back!!!!
Stand firm!! WE ARE WITH YOU MR PRESIDENT!!!
Except the... It's my way or I shut down the government... is the Worst form of negotiating...
Getting you outta office its time for impeachment
Dems won't vote for wall funding, but fund illegal aliens health care, 56 Billion in foreignaid last year.....So next time you pay your copay remember people here illegally get a free ride.
No, Americans want Impeachment!!
It is true that most Americans want border security. However most Americans are smart enough to realize that a wall is not going to secure the border.
Yes! We have got to have border security.
Michael Brian  At least it is Relevant Unlike  trumps broken record of Hilary Obama and the Dems
Yes! We have got to have border security.
What time is the speech tonight??
So if you like polls, then do a test to see how many people like or love a post regarding building a wall for border security and how many people hate it. Just about as accurate as anything the news networks state as a statistic/percentage. Just hover over the "like" and "love" icons in this post and see what real Americans on FB are are approving of and who are actually hating it. Done this test on hundreds of posts from either side of the aisle and I'm of the opinion the media is in fact lying and fake for their own agenda and reasons, as are most politicians.

Can anyone actually reference where there are facts to support a wall being effective at curbing illegal immigration?  I have looked at various sources and don't see agreement that it will be the solution he keeps saying it will be.

Use ElChapos seized money. or basically any drug seized cash.
...Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was declared guilty of the three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against the internal and external security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities in the interest of the enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Antoinette
For them stopping you, stay on task.
Stopping you is their priority. Doesn‚Äôt matter what it is. They must work to stop you.
When you see the Mexican President the number you need him to agree to is 108,400,000,000 pesos  Have Baron write it down for you and put it in your pocket.
So first year we save 270 billion Next yr we save 275 billion Wow that's simple math for democrats to understand Looks to me like wall pays for itself and is a money maker
Stopping you and destroying us. Investigate the Democrats as thoroughly as they‚Äôve investigated you Mr. President!
Every president has the right to take steps for safety and better future of the nation who selected him. I must say Donald Trump has always been loyal to America . He is doing right and the best for americans

You do what ever it takes to build that Wall mr. PRESIDENT
President Trump stand strong, we the people love you. You love our country and we will stand behind you. Build the wall.
Just look at how much money Americans have raised in contributions for The Wall.  President Trump, do not back down.  We have your back.
Declare an emergency start the wall then open the government
Democrat politicians don‚Äôt want a secure border or a prosperous America. Both are a threat to their power.
Please do not give in!!! The elected Democrat's are pathetic. They care nothing for the safety of the people or this nation.  Stand ground for something you believe in and a big majority of us believe in also.
Promise???? You said Mexico was paying for this wall. Another of your lies....
Change the stance and work to stop border funding all together and the democrats will have the wall built in 72 hours.

Mr. President, my cousin is an honorably discharged marine with a very sick wife at home, today he figured out how you could get free labor to build the wall so all you would have to but is the building materials.  His name is James (Jim) Blackburn, he lives close to St. Louis, MO    this is his post                                                                                                                                                                                     Jim Blackburn 15 hrs ¬∑  I would gladly take 2 days out of my life and without pay go to the border and help build the wall. Its my duty to still help protect the country.
Why hasn't anyone asked Pelosi why she had a wall built around her home and why she has locks on her doors
Protect our borders and "Build the Wall" you  are supported more than you know..
Yes we do and isn‚Äôt it amazing under every other president they‚Äôve wanted barriers or walls too. Just not under Trump hmmmmmm two faced idiots I think
Stand strong.  Don't give in to the Democrats and keep the govt shut down.  We want the wall.
Definitely not border security or America first.
I hope beyond anyone‚Äôs hatred or disagreements for our president ... we all listen to hear clear concise points without prejudice why this is so important.
Lawrence Plaisance yep that's what I meant in Lawrence
This is what we call a president ,fighting for the safety and well been of his people. Mr president keep up with that same spirit 2020+

Kellyanne Conway said Sarah Sanders made a mistake when she cited 4,000 terrorists come through the southern border. No Kellyanne, it is NOT a mistake, it is a LIE. If a reporter can get the correct data from Trump administration, so can Sarah Sanders. #Liar

Please stop all the killing of our animals and wild life. The seals to the whales to the wild horses and buffalo. I am all for the wall, and all that but leave the animals alone. Please stop the trophy hunting. There is no need for such a horrific thing. Thank you Mr. President.

Mike Pence was asked about individual 1‚Äôs claim that some of former presidents confided to him they wanted to build the wall themselves. However, all living presidents denied ever told individual 1 about it. Mike Pence‚Äôs response American people are not concerned about the political aspect of it. How about the truth Mike. You are a religious person, how about the truth.
What americans want is for someone to take you out...
Dems don't support a wall, but they sure are standing around like one...
You promised (stupidly) that Mexico would pay for the wall. How is Americans footing the bill making good on that promise? Insanity.
We already have a wall, President Trump just want to finish it. The Democrats want a wall and they built part of it. What good is a part of the wall . Need to finish the wall
Says corporate media is "fake". Follows Fox News religiously. üôà
I mostly agree with the wall but! The bad will still find a way in.. Just like the "gun" laws.

I mostly agree with the wall but! The bad will still find a way in.. Just like the "gun" laws.
It is obvious that they will fight you on anything and everything. This is their agenda and they could care less what the majority of US citizens want!
I don't see this as half true.
I want my paycheck. Where is my pay? Oh yeah...working for free....thanks allot POTUS.   #LOSTMYVOTE
You want your way and it ain't the right way
The dums dont want to work with you, Mr. President. They want our nation to cease as a republic and transform it into a socialist nation. Stay the course, sir!! Praying for you!!
We need this wall! Do your job and protect our borders and people! Listen to our President and build it!
keep pounding on the table. lol build the wall!
Securing the border without building a wall. Can you do it?
No daca no amnesty build the wall

BUILD THE WALL MR. PRESIDENT!  Don't back down...
No we Americans dont . Its rediculous.
Mr. President (My Prez) Thank you for all you do! God put you in the White House. You have millions of supporters that have your back! Fight the good fight, you will win in the end. Thank you sir. I love my Prez and First Lady, and all of your family!
Democrats are trouble makers are  not there for American success.
Isn't a wall just the equivalent of the walls of your house?  Imagine a house with no walls, would you like that???  Makes sense now doesn't it!!!
Democrats should just change the name of their party to Obstructionists.....
How is it that an American citizen can work 40 years and pay into SSI ,retire and be told  they can't collect from SSI because the make too much from their retirement??? Where did their EARNED money go???...I've lost all faith in this government they take everything give nothing and say they're doing it FOR us...no ladies and gentlemen...your doing it TO us.... thanks
ElCoyote EJ Sanchez do you have children and grandchildren?
Stand up we love you President Trump for what you are doing GOD BLESS AMERICA
TRUMP u said during election Mexico was going to fund it. Y the change? The ones saying build the wall would u go to work without pay? Having rent to pay
Every time it's, we will do security After!  After what you ask, well it depends on the time.  This time it's after potus gives in.  Stand fast!
Con artist deception and deflection propaganda.
Border security and ‚Äúa wall‚Äù are two different things.  They gave you plenty of money for border security, you just couldn‚Äôt have your penis-compensating giant monstrosity of a ‚Äúwall.‚Äù  Grow tf up and stop throwing a temper tantrum because you didn‚Äôt get exactly what you wanted!
Stoping you!  You got to keep in mind they are insane
The Schumer/Pelosi shutdown needs to end.  Build the wall now.
My President Donald J. Trump. Please stop. You have the majority of Americans nationwide that support a wall to end or deter Illegal immigration. It is a National emergency most people with half a brain can understand the jist of it. So call it one and let's move on.
Make better promises & everyone will back you.

It's not about stopping you. It's about you not giving up. Remember, you promised Mexico would pay for the wall
Yep! Security is your key word! Not wall!!
If you built golf courses at the border, no one would want to go anywhere near the border, and no one could afford to play golf there either.
Thank You President Trump for all you do for the American People.
Yes, we want border security.
I'm from El Paso , Texas I live in a border city. That wall will work against criminal activity for sure and I'm around those type of people that the government calls criminals. I'm with you Trump build the wall. realDonaldTrump
BUILD THE WALL!  STICK TO THE PLAN THAT GOT YOU ELECTED!
Declaring a national emergency will. Cause him more problems ,he can have money for extra security more staff and the needed equipment but not a stupid wall that will fail ,it‚Äôs not a national  emergency ,and most are against it ,his facts are wrong all wrong ,he‚Äôs special
Border security does not necessitate a wall. Wall will never be funded. Get over it. trump lied to you & you believed him. Contact him for details.

Stefan Edlund AMERICA is important to our President. This isn‚Äôt about campaign promises. This is about national security.
No dear. Trust me. Our president don‚Äôt give a damn about America or its security. He ONLY cares about himself and his businesses.

I agree with border security so that services for American citizens continue to be available. However the govt needs to be reopened. Veterans and disabled and seniors depend on our incomes food stamps and insurances to survive and now we r being told that the shutdown is going to affect all these things. What are we to do?
66 BILLION earmarked for foreign aid now is it? And Americans who lock their front doors at night are asking to approve 5.6 Billion to help with national security and curtail people entering ILLEGALLY? What exactly is the problem here?
I totally support you Trump.....is your obligation as a president to do what s necessary.......Am an African I believe we should travel at the right channel.....The love is deep....love you Trump...love America..
Lol. I screenshot bbc news article that says americans are largely uninterested in trumps border wall....
Stopping you, of course. Build the wall!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Your promise was build the wall but we would not have to pay for it. You have gone back on that promise.
Build the wall mr trump we all the 65 million supporting. You üá∫üá∏üëçüèº

Keep it up President Trump. Build the Wall. No compromise. It's been tried more than once already. Democrats lie and have no honor.
I stand with my President. BUILD THE WALL!!!
Yes we do!! BUILD OUR WALL!! STOP ALL FUNDING TO STATES THAT HAVE SANCTUARY CITIES!!
Take 5.6 billion from from foriegn aid. Enough fucking around build the wall and let me fight Schumer.
Build the wall President Donald J. Trump, stay strong sir and keep The United States of America safe. Thankyou. God bless you with His wisdom, guidance, love, peace, and prosperity.
Best I have heard so far  ‚ÄúIf they only loved our country as much as they hate our president!‚Äù
Making better decisions that are logical that supports a plan to reduce and or eliminate illegal migration. Maybe meet at the table with sound and clear ask. You should know how to do that since you have built many structures.
Build the wall Mr. President Trump i dont care i can wait on my taxes i waited this long for tax time i can wait longer to recieve it.
Build the wall mr trump we all the 65 million supporting. You üá∫üá∏üëçüèº
The same question over and over I keep asking, the ones that are against the wall. Do you have children and grandchildren?
Thank you Mr President! You're doing what TRUE Americans desire. Stand strong I pray for you daily.
Give him the money for the wall and make him the general contractor under 2 conditions he must stay out of the White House and he cannot charge a toll
U know I think each and every place should tear down they walls this is everyone's land
The libetals will fight him no matter what. If he says no wall tomorrow, the libetals will go crazy against him
Pelosi and Shumer are only putting up a fight because it's Trump.  They Wanted this before. Stand ground and build the wall apparently they don't think we can read the comments about the need for more border security they made in the past.
Americans want border security but you‚Äôre screwing the wrong people with this shutdown!  Hard working Americans are suffering by not getting paid! Namely the Coast Guard who put their lives on the line everyday to save others lives!!! Your statement ‚Äòthe people not getting a paycheck will find a way to live‚Äô is ignorant and ludicrous!  Stop this ridiculousness now!!!
American Wall not just Trumps Wall
They hate you and don‚Äôt care about Americans. What they care about is themselves, money and power.
Bring back the comanche helicopter and the a10 warthog
Check out the polls on Americans wanting this 100 miles of useless wall addition and repair. Not looking good, DFT.
Build the wall Mr President!! We know your trying hard. You are so right all of Congress live behind walls why???? Why should we protect them if they can't protect us. Take their security away!!
You're the biggest crybaby to every hold this once respected office. You're like the rich kid that doesn't get his way and cries to his rich parents until you get what you want. Wait you're not like they.... You are that. Disgrace.
Their job apparently is to disagree with everything you want to do. It‚Äôs more about that!
Do away with the Federal Reserve, restore gun rights permenantly.
I think the opposition needs a drug test and a psych eval. They are ü¶áü¶áü¶áü¶áü§°
Close the southern border Now Sir
What are the real number. Lay it all out for real Americans. Will taxes go up or will we reduce other spending?
I‚Äôm from Australia. We like Trump. He loves his country. Be grateful, and careful what you wish for.
The money seized from drugs coming from Mexico since 1946 could build that wall IN GOLD

You just call about money, why cant you just pay for the wall your damn self your a fucking millionaire
Oops my bad billionaire
Paige Elizabeth call about money.   How many other presidents do you know that is taking $0 to run this country.   Oh that's right no other president besides Trump has done that.  He has gotten paid $0. And has put up with a bunch of crap from liberals who are blinded and don't want to see the truth
I‚Äôm from Australia. We like Trump. He loves his country. Be grateful, and careful what you wish for.
God bless America!
Was the promise Americans would not pay for the wall !!!
What happened to you saying in the televised meeting with democratic leadership that you would take ownership of the shutdown.....must have been crossing your fingers...
What's more important to the Democrats is to be humanitarian to criminals. How many children suffer when parents are sentenced for crimes. Do we let our humanitarian approach to life remove the penalty for crime.  President Trump desparate times call for desparate measures. Stop the shutdown and play your aces.
Trump I applaud you you are doing a great job  !!!! Pelusi scheummer puppets lol

Thank you President Trump!
I dont care what the Democrazies want I want a talllllll Concrete Wall and a secure border..  Hang in there President Trump.
The only thing the Democrats want his control and power, they don‚Äôt care about the people or the country and their number one goal is to hurt our great and wonderful president
Im not against building the wall but this shutdown has to stop
How can a few people. Doesn't matter who they are stip the president of the United States  from diverting money from one place to spend it on building a wall to help his country? He is the PRESIDENT.  Just do it Donald and let the snowflakes scream as long as they like.
SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE GOVT. THEY MIGHT THINK TWICE THEN.
Is anyone from Texas, AZ, or NM? I would like to hear your opinion on the matter.
Americans first always  we tax payers want our wall  Thank You Mr President!!
I'm stand with my President Trump
We the true American people want a wall built. We want our children safe.
Democraps want to stop the President. And they don't care how many legal citizens lives are lost in the process. To the left, that's acceptable as long as they get their way. Sort of sounds like a spoiled brat....no?
They do not care what the people want, Mr. President!
Why not a giant billboard that says "whites only!"? It is just as effective and saves a ton of money.
Do not bend anymore...Build The Wall ..My President..Go Boss Go
Stand firm sir, I'll get by no SS check this month
Border security is more important!
We need the wall and Trump will get it done.
We Stand Beside You mr. President build the wall is everybody's been saying Heaven has walls and Angels guard them and that's what we must have here on Earth Allah for the borders so we can stay safe and secure and if they don't like it too bad God is on our side God bless you mr. President
The truth is DEMS DO NOT CARE about anyone or anything else other than themselves !
I'm stand with my President Trump
The truth is DEMS DO NOT CARE about anyone or anything else other than themselves !
If we're using voters, more voters voted for Clinton than for trump. So your argument about who wants the wall, more don't want it than those who do want it. Bullshit!
Werner Evans got news for you. It doesn't matter who won the popular vote. That is not how we vote on presidents. Trump is your president.
Eric S Siegel i don't dispute he is the president russian meddling notwithstanding.I dispute arguments using incorrect facts. When he gets impeached, i'll consider him my ex-president.

A wall would cut into their money from drug running to human trafficking to gun running. They are trying their best to make this country a third world country where we are all their subjects. You better like Trump cause he‚Äôs the only one to save us from these beasts. That‚Äôs the truth. This is no game!!!
It‚Äôs our security .., FUND THE WALL
The wall pelosi the wall the rest will fall in line
What's more important is keeping your word to the American people when you said the Mexican President would pay for your wall.
What‚Äôs more important to the Democrats is trying to look as crazy as they are ridiculous God bless you President Trump
YES!!! What is wrong with the damn democrats?
Some depts are open unemployment a friend doesn't get help works for the city t Toni harp is his boss
SINCE YOU WERE ELECTED, WHAT HAS OUR DEMOCRATS DONE TO HELP YOU MAKE AMERICA ANY BETTER I'LL WAIT
Eric S Siegel i don't dispute he is the president russian meddling notwithstanding.I dispute arguments using incorrect facts. When he gets impeached, i'll consider him my ex-president.
Exactly!!! Stopping his main campaign promise is their top priority! Borders, Language and Culture be damned...
Secure the border!! Why do Dems need a rebuttal to Tonight‚Äôs speech from the Oval Office? Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if they went back to congress to do their jobs?
All I heard were lies from them
If they do not work with you to get a wall....they will not be re-elected but you will!
Don't give in, we are behind you 100%. Build the wall.
Mr President I truly appreciate all you are doing for our country.  We were in desperate need of a leader who is not controlled by the political pigs that have made a career out of the position.  Keep doing what you are doing, you have more support than you know.  Praying that our country can be turned around and that we eventually can all just come together to get things done.
Thank you Mr. President for loving this country. I‚Äôm praying for you. Stay strong.
I Stand by you Mr. President Trump. Don't give up!! Keep Government Shut Down till We Get OUR WALL!! I have love and respect for you and will vote again for you #Trump2020 üíô‚ù§

Just start using reverse  psychology and then you will get what the true Patriots want for our  country!!  God bless You Mr. President!!!!!
You made a vague attempt but didnt go deep enough with the evidence to prove the need. I did some research and found much more than you shared.  Who is staying with evidence gathering? You should have reached out to me?
All you people out there who don‚Äôt support securing our borders. I want you all to take your locks off your front door. Because you don‚Äôt need them.  Apparently you can live with your countries front doors unlocked. And next time you go to the market don‚Äôt lock your car in the parking lot.
So completely full of BS! Are you unable to understand poll results on this subject? It certainly seems to be the case.
How about paychecks? Pretty sure that want those also.
You also need to stop congress pays why should they get there checks while the goverment is shut down..stand strong mr president the American people are counting on you
You promised to build a wall an have Mexico pay for it. Anything other than that is not fulfillment of your promise. #ChangeMyMind
You‚Äôre the only one not willing to work as a team. You are a national bully.
The safety of inhumanity challenged !! Lol .
It's Crystal clear....all they care about is stopping him.
They will just dig a cave like  El Chapo .....all those millions wasted...eh amigo
Vice President Pence said in an interview today that most Americans are not interested in the truth.  I for one am not one of them!
Like Obama would have done, just sign an executive order and build the wall. Stop playing with these hypocrites who flip flop and build the wall.
Pelosi and Shumer are trying their best to stop president trump from getting reelect in 2020. They don't care about the American taxpaying citizens!

What's the over/under for number of lies you put forward tonight?
Good.  Keep using opinion pieces to explain your idiocy.
Lets be clear, we could care less what its made of, we want it strong and effective!
Shutting down CBP, FBI, Coast Guard, DOJ in order to 'get your way' on a policy, is assinine, is a threat to national security, and is not about your promises. It is, a convenient smokescreen so you arent impeached and imprisoned sooner, though...
Could we pay for the shut down out of congress' salary.
I'll be honest, with the way that these four years have been going and especially the last year-and-a-half I don't think I'll be voting for him again next election.  I'll have to see what he does and I might change my mind, we'll see.
Clearly Dems only care about stopping trump at ALL costs no matter how good for our country.   Build the wall!!!!  T R U M P ! !
Of course it's to stop you from doing anything good.
Secure our Borders!  Build the wall!!

Seems as if democrats have a vendetta. Most all voted for border security before but now with Trump in off it is immoral. Their speeches were played back so it is sickening.
Sir your promise was to have Mexico pay for it!
Stay strong Mr. President, your doing exactly what we elected you to do!
They care nothing about this country when it comes to making sure you don't keep your promise.
Politicians work for the American people, if Dems want to keep showing their asses please do an executive order to limit their terms which end this year with new line ups to get voted in, time the POS leave their spots anyways
The normal-minded agree but the leftist socialists won't agree with anything that makes sense!
Do t give in we stand behind you Mr. President. We want a wall...
Build the wall!! Any improvement in  border security is a good thing. What's so hard for the Democrats to understand that?

Secure our border. Build the wall and give border security the full power to defend our border.
PLEASE President Donald J. Trump...NEVER EVER have a meeting with Chuck and Nancy that is not on camera. They cannot behave themselves.
Democrats are sentimental men, they want to do charity. What a lofty idea!
We the people go fund. Talk about the 19 million raised.
Make sure you remind the American people what pelosi and Schumer have said about border security in the past. Show the videos!!  Those don‚Äôt lie!
Please Build The Wall. I want to feel safe agin. I stand with President Trump. Don't Back Down.
Mary Stone not such a good negotiator!
Build the wall, close the border.  We support you, Mr. President.
So legally coming into this country is ok.. but the soft pussies want to let the whole world in...not fair to my grandparents

You were doing so well, then you had to attack the 2nd Amendment, lost many of your 2020 voters. You manipulated ATF and you re wrote ATF's currant laws... bad move! No one person should ever have that kind of power!
I have a crazy question & do not mean any ill will at all!  I was just curious!  Who actually sells & profits from the MAG AGAIN items in the Trump Shop that is always at top of President Trump‚Äôs FB posts?  Thank you in advance!
Mr President. I support You. Thank You for trying to do what is right for American Citizens. You got my 2020 Vote. üá±üá∑
They do want border security but a wall is asinine
Stand tough!  Don‚Äôt give in until you have the wall funded!  Fund the wall before you end the shutdown!

straight talk and jobs done.. that's Donny the PRESIDENT
It also help people that all facilities will be upgraded so people will not die after they cross from dehydration or hunger after 1000 mile journey .. we will have better life wading equipment .. better medical.. better family holding areas .. did anybody think about that .. it‚Äôs not just a wall !!!
Israel and Saudi Arabia send illegals
As usual, you have no factual proof or real numbers to back your claim. Lies lies lies...that's all you know.
Fools. The only reason Trump wants this wall is so he stands a chance come election time. Don the Con has half of America drooling over his drivel üòÇ
Dear Mr. President, please don‚Äôt ask us to put up a wall. Don‚Äôt you realize we the Democrats would get less new customers? We can‚Äôt abandon a major element of our strategic growth plan.   - Chuck and Nancy
Tell them to stop making it personal, and let's all get this shutdown shut down!
All they have to do is look at the go fund me account to build the wall.  The American people have given over 16 million
On another topic, didn't Donny promise the coal miners he would put them back to work? Appears he's not keeping his word on that little promise. https://www.nbc4i.com/news/u-s-world/coal-mines-closing-at-a-faster-rate-under-pres-trump-than-obama/1690261093
Good point. They just care about not letting you win!!
It is quite clear that the democrats to do not have the best interest of the people they serve. They give new meaning to "power hungry."
The nay Sayers and to think what t heyy

Build the wall and  stand up for the second amendment!
Or the fact President Trump cant be bought because he is already rich.
He spoke valid reasons in fairness....has heroin takin more lives than the Vietnam war?
When Mexico pays for it!
Again, the ‚ÄúMe‚Äù word. Signs of a pathological narcissist. The presidency is above and beyond ‚Äúyou‚Äù. It‚Äôs about ‚Äúus‚Äù. Where did you learn these self centered tendencies? How long is it going to take America to repair the damage done?
‚ÄúProvide for the common defense, ensure domestic tranquility!‚Äù #Buidthewall !
You go Linda Dean, old Matt Bachugan has never seen a lady with balls, might get his ass handed back to him  lol
Yes we do! Stand strong and firm Mr. President!

Build the wall, but stop keeping my paycheck hostage!

Please build the wall POTUS! You are the Man!
You plan on pulling troops out of Syria and Afghanistan! Take the 5 billion off the table implement border security with the money that would‚Äôve been used in the Middle East!  Best of both worlds, you keep your promise on border security and you force Democrats into defending their neocon foreign-policy position!  But I don‚Äôt think you have the Balls to #StopTheCrusade
I'm behind President Trump 100% President Trump 20/20
By now it should be obvious Trump is not cut from the same cloth as a. Traditional politician  2020 you got my vote
They hate our President more than they love our country.
Stand strong, the silent majority supports you!!!!
We do need border protection, thank you for making a stand!
I think every person who voted for you wants the wall. So.. how many of us? üòç We voted for president, not Pelosi/Chuck, we dont need them to make any decision.
Need a Great Wall of America!üëçüí™ü§ù
Pelosi and Schumer KNOW that if Trump delivers on the wall...  he is confirmed for re-election!!  Trump knows if he DON‚ÄôT deliver on the wall.....  it‚Äôs his ‚ÄúRead my lips - - - No new taxes‚Äù moment!!  Build That Wall.....
At this point getting people back to work and accepting some money for the border would be a good compromise. Otherwise our economy is going to implode and I and others may lose our house!  A new section of wall would good  progress and make it easier for border guards to cover the area with the same manpower.
I see the support that americans have given for the building of a wall. I am just hoping i can reach a few of you to help me.I am a current active duty veteran on leave here in altoona,pa and my wife‚Äôs little brother passed away this past Saturday. We buried her mother last year so we already know we can not afford the expenses that come with this more recent death. If there is anything that you guys can do to help my family and i, even if it is just sharing this i would be forever grateful of every last one of you for supporting us. This is my link i started for the family. Hey, I'm supporting this fundraiser, please have a look - 'Family of Tyler Gehret' https://dm2.gofund.me/family-of-tyler-gehret, we have been successful so far and i want to restore faith in humanity by helping this family enter the new year with some type of hope, please even if you just share it will mean the world to this family
We can build the Southern USA Canal, better than we built Panama Canal, wider & deeper, and if it needs a fence, build it.
Why don't you build a dome? It would be much safer. Ilegals and criminals can climb a wall or dig tunnels but they can do nothing against a dome. Protect America please! You're are the unique capable of doing so. Stay strong!
BUILD THAT WALL. We need a red cap that says. ‚Äú BUILD THAT WALL‚Äù
You failed miserably! Have Mexico pay for the wall. We‚Äôll pay for the roof.
Democrats have become a disgrace. Build the wall
Stand strong, the silent majority supports you!!!!
If we need to vote for wall, let us do the vote. It will prevail, as votes for you prevailed.
Your promise had MEXICO paying for it . Remember???
U need a happy meal from mcdonalds!
After he builds the wall, he needs to investigate why So many Muslim can come here and own top notch businesses, when Americans can not afford to.  Most little store, I hops, waffle houses, hotels I can go on and on!
Stopping you at any cost. They don‚Äôt care about the taxpayers, all they want are the votes from the Hispanics that cross the border illegally.
BUILD THE WALL!! Thank you Mr.President for everything you have done to get this country back on track! GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA üá∫üá∏
I fully support you Mr. President, but please try to work this out. The shut own isn't affecting me, personally, but it will soon hurt millions of Americans. I want you to win another term as our President, and I'm afraid if this lingers on too long, it will affect the voters in the next election. I'm all for a wall, but the policies we have in effect now need to be enforced much HARDER than they are now. Hell, they'll figure out a way to climb over the wall sooner or later anyway, we need stronger punishments for the ones that get here first.

Just because Trump calls all the media outlets fake news doesn't make what he says true.   "The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command." - Orwell, 1984  And yet so many run like lambs to slaughter behind this President. Open your eyes, open your hearts. The enemy is not outside our borders, it's sitting in the White House.

Republicans had both houses for last two years. Why didn‚Äôt you build the wall then?
Looking forward to your speech tonight. All In.
Demoncrates. Are for the money and not the people
Keep going Donald....you are doing great. God put you there, and us with you. You got this.
You already voted that Mexico will pay for the wall!
We understand what is going on.  Stand strong against them.  Their leader is Satin.

Elizabeth Navarrete Ponte then you and the 22,7% of the voters that's left of the people who still want the wall can start emptying your piggy banks and pay for it yourselves So that means from the 135.7M voters just 30.8M people still want the wall... if you all collect 185 each then you can start building the wall... for now, but in the coming years you must pay that again because the wall is going to cost more than 50B + maintainance
If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
In the name of Jesus build the Wall.
Yes thank you Mr President for making us safe
we "the people" voted for him because he will build that wall!!
They want to stop him from building the wall at all costs. Itd guarantee his win in 2020
Steady the course Mr. President the horizon is close.
When the US military rapes the borders of other countries. Waiting for border security in America is ridiculous.
Sure our President Trump's will do with out his pay. Start at top and next.....Congress.

Keep up the good work Mr. President Sir...
Build the wall Mr President.  Don't back down
Build the wall!  Stand strong Mr. President, your base supports you!  #MAGA
Human trafficking of any kind should propel everyone to support all border security measures!
They only want to stop it to make trumps base mad at him
Those democrats are jeopardizing our future by their selfish and self center behaviors. Those democrats are protecting their own egos and do not care about the American citizens. Everyone in this country is going to suffer because a few people at top refuse to admit they are wrong.

What is more important to the president ...saving America? Or saving his pride?
Congress has "debated" long enough. It's time for results! Keep the government closed until they resolve this crisis. My family and I will sacrifice while I wait for my paycheck.
What is important to Democrats is to do nothing for the American people. They love power and money.
Great job last night mr President, unfortunately the media will distort the facts and the truth üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
love trump and how he loves his country be strong. what happened to the me too movement not going after gangs coming into country defending women
I am concerned about the future of America...say 20 years from now. I know you won't be there but the seeds you have sown will surely hurt your base more severely
votes, dems want votes, to the detriment of U.S. border security.
Learn from Europeans mistake...secure the border!
Donald J. Trump
Just. Build. It. Get money from elsewhere and do it!!!!
I dont know anyone who wants a wall just saying
Build the wall and stop paying and giving benefits to these politicians who are not doing their jobs.
BUILD OUR WALL. GOD ONLY KNOWS WE NEED IT. üíòAMEN!!!!
If you worked with the Democrats and opened your mind, you would see that wall is useless and a waste of money.  You would also see that a wall on the border would cost way more than 5 or 7 billion....
Anything you want or propose, they will try and stop.  As Mr. Graham said,  they still can't get over that YOU won
I WISH HE COULD FIRE! ALL OF THESE OVER PAID AND UNDER. PERFORMING FOOLS!
The Democrats don‚Äôt care what the issue is, they just want to make you look bad.  I support your agenda, but please stop the tweets.  They are mean spirited and divisive.  Your policies are refreshing and I love being able to hear from you directly on your Facebook page.  But your tweets are not good for anyone.
Keep on don‚Äôt give in to those losers that are driven by hate and if they weren‚Äôt in the government they wouldn‚Äôt no what to do . Lol you stick to it me. President you got this and god has you!
He‚Äôs the bankrupt proven liar but we‚Äôre the ones with the fake information? 45 was right about one thing, he could shoot someone on fifth avenue and they wouldn‚Äôt care. He‚Äôs got them in the bag! Glad I‚Äôm not one of his cult members!!
Learn from Europeans mistake...secure the border!
Take Pelosi down there and drop her off on the Mexico side to walk to town there. I guarantee she will we welcomed with open arms for one reason only and then they will kill her. Why do we have to open Our arms to everyone.
Let's do it steel wall transparency is great too üòéüòÖ
You campaigned on the promise Mexico would pay for it.Make your word right for the first time in your life
Yes we want the wall. Take the Democrats walls and fences down.
Legalizing medical marijuana on a federal level
Nope not at all!!! To that hate wall!!!Not this American Donnie!!! Anybody else???
We want the wall or steel fence or what ever will keep out intruders.
Fulfilling your promise that Mexico will pay for it?
This is what needs to be done:  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/white-house-framework-immigration-reform-border-security/
No you promised Mexico would pay for it so it‚Äôs not the Dems fault you lie

Lead by exuctive order.  Ram it down their throats
We stand with you Trump! Don't give up,  don't give in. Leave the government shut down til we get the wall!!!
Yes we do we Americans want the border secure your right Mr President. I am so glad I voted for you.
Start paying our men you sent to stop the caravan that never showed up and let the ones re up that want to your not helping are military your your cutting are throut just like Johnson did.
Declare national emergency and build the wall. Then, open the government. If you open the government before the wall is funded and construction started, you‚Äôll never get it done.
Secure the border! They're against you regardless of what you do!!!
I do not support the president in building a wall. It is our corporations that is attracting the illegals. But most of all I am not raciest and believe in a free America not walls to protect me but my belief in jesus teaching. Jesus would never build a wall around the this country even tho we are becoming less free day by day...
Just called my senator Johnny Isaakson  Left message to support our border wall.

Make the wall out of see through bulletproof type glass with auto steel shutter panels that can be closed if needed for additional strength..  The border patrol is safe and can see whats happening on other side too.
Ginger LaConte agree

The employee's  can draw unemployment  and food stamps.  And they will get back pay later!
"Mexico will pay for the wall!" Democrats are not stopping this from happening!
Makes me so angry because all they want to do is see you fail. You've already proven yourself. Job well done. Thank you President Trumpüá∫üá∏
Love you Donald.  Keep up the good job
We love Israel
President Trump put the  debate with Congress on TV so the American  people can see the discussion in Congress!!!
We need the wall. They say you're inciting fear,  the fear is they know the wall has to be built.  Fearful of losing noncitizen votes. Keep inciting fear.
Pretty much arguing with a wall at this point. Let em argue with the border wall!!!
The wall is going to be a money pit and end up being an abandoned waste of money. Everyone keeps neglecting the cost of up keep for that thing on top of all the lawsuits for commandeered land and encroaching on endangered species lamd
Their object is to stop YOU at all costs, and at every turn.  They want border security, but not from YOU.  They want a wall, but not from YOU.  They want safe streets, but not from YOU.  They want a better economy, but not from YOU.  They want everything YOU have given them, but will never acknowledge it because, it came from YOU.  They hate YOU so much, it will be their downfall.    Mr. Trump - stick to your guns.  NO compromise.   BUILD YOUR WALL.
It should be a proper wall, the same as Great Wall of China, with viewing platforms, tourism attractions around it, visible from the Moon.. One day people will want to visit it..
Keep it shut until you build that wall we are with you till the end
A wall might not solve it why not have guards in towers or somthing that doesnt cost as much but gets ths point across.
Put an electric fence at the top of the wall and be done with it
Declare a state of emergency and get the wall built! Fake news isn't interested in all the insane things going on at our border.
Gotta love people living up north, talking about the southern border. Makes sense.
Ramen noodles for everyone!!!!
I want boarder security and the elected officials to work together for the good of this country.   It‚Äôs not about their own political agenda or political views.   Stop fight with each other and get to work.  The people have spoken, build the wall, stop illegals from coming in.
Demi are showing how hateful they are.  Such great Christians.
I hope someone is airing the speech live tonight on FB. My ATT Uverse went out during the Alabama game last night and won‚Äôt be restored until tomorrow!
I noticed you stopped referring to it as The Wall. Is that because Democrats have consistently advocated for other forms of security?  Because anyone with any sense knows A Wall is a colossal waste of money?
How exactly are the Democrats stopping your promise that Mexico would pay for a wall?
All they want is to stop the Pres. From doing anything  !!!
Put an electric fence at the top of the wall and be done with it
Democrats make me sick with their ignorance. I cannot grasp their way of thinking. Gain some knowledge about what's coming into the U.S. through illegal immigration. #BuildtheWall üá∫üá∏
I think the majority of them do want a wall.   The squeaky wheel don't want it but they never poll a sufficient number of average Americans to know what they want.   Regardless, thankfully we are not governed by polls and popularity.
Stand firm sir..get that wall built..keep government shut down going until they adhere to border security!
They only care about not letting you win!
Stopping you from succeeding in anything you do...they just want the power back so they can continue to screw the American people and line their  pockets.   100% behind you....BUILD THE WALL
People need to stand up to the government. Stop letting the government decide how much money they can take from us.
Don't let the media or Dearest mama Nancy ever make you believe we are not with you Preaisent Trump We are with you all the way
We the People will build the wall in spite of all the goodies We will not back down ever
All they want is to stop the Pres. From doing anything  !!!
Dont give up until the wall is built!!!!
Sorry but worry about paying our people who have recieved no checks. Worry about the millions who depend on food stamps and are not receiving them first. To add value to this nation you need to impact the most lives and give back. Right now this wall is distracting you from carring for our own people in the short term why are we starving folks over this? This isnt a political statement anymore the American people are actually suffering.
Whats wrong with you if he shuts up where woukd u be?he doesn't need money he is fightin for us..and you like it or not
God bless and protect you president trump.AMEN!
A balanced budget. Isn't that another of your broken promises?
I have a solution for the border wall issue. While I'd love a wall, and I think it would be effective, I have an idea since it appears no one can budge.  Part 1. Shut the border Part 2. Request 160K acres from Mexico to borrow for a temporary period of the next 6 years. Part 3. Work with Mexican authorities to build holding facilities(cages with barbed wire) in that 160K acres. Part 4. Work with Mexican authorities to fund and staff a holding facility for the people trying to get in. Part 5. Then, put a suggestion box in the registration building for people to turn in their applications for either asylum or citizenship. Part 6. Ask said people to please be patient while we process your paperwork.
One problem, it's one border and it's land based; there are also a lot of things get through the I-5 corridor which already has things in place to stop them. . .üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
So do Democrats you lying ‚Äòtool.‚Äô
Beyond every point now..my President can't back down or he'll lose face..I think everybody understands that stance.,..MAGA
We the People will build the wall in spite of all the goodies We will not back down ever

U said Mexico would pay for it!!!!!
We are with you President Trump
America first should be the theme to bring everyone together
Yes we want the border. You have many behind you.
Yes we do and we support u for standing for the good of Americans
I want the border wall. Having said that you said Mexico would pay. Now we have to do so which I have no problem with except that Senate and Congress, let's just say Capital Hill should be shut down NOT the American workers! They make a lot of money with no regard to us and they still take home a paycheck!!
We're so disgusted with the democrats in Washington.  Shumer and Pelosi are crazy and they're making decisions!!! Aren't there any good democrats out there who will stop being led by these two crazies?
Alot of americans have your back! Maybe we can get companies to donate the materials you need for the wall and have volunteers to help build it.  Im sure you know alot of people Mr.  President that may help.  Im sure americans will be happy to volunteer to build it
Stay the Course Mr President..
Derrick Dupuy Please tell Nancy and Chuck...
Americans want border security. We are with you President Trump.
Joshua 1: 9 Reina-Valera 1960 (RVR1960)  9 See that I command you to be strong and courageous; Do not fear or be dismayed, for Jehovah your God will be with you wherever you go.

Americans want border security! Keep doing what your doing! Build the wall #Trump2020
Build the wall and make cannabis legal again!2020!
Stay the Course Mr President..
Build the wall! However, if those who oppose it want to be fair and do what the people really want put it to a vote by the American people. Make every legal vote count. Give a deadline and make states hold a special vote. Or make it where all legal registered voters vote online using their voter registration i.d. link it to vital statistics so that the dead and illegal aren't voting and so that no one can vote more than once.
Your promise was Mexico would pay.
Do whatever you need to do. Don't give the damn Democrats anything .
JUST DO IT MR. PRESIDENT...THE POWER OF THE PEN WORKS...
Mr. President can you also make sure Polosi and shummer are on the other side of that beautiful wall! They're not Americans!!!
Maybe , do the unexpected...you give something to the Pelosi gang extend your good intentions first? Then emplore the people?
Secure our borders! Stand strong; be wise. Surround yourself with people you can trust; people that have a good moral compass. God bless you and strengthen you and guide you.
Build the Wall! Praying for you and our great country!
Mr President.  I think you should ask Chuck and Nancy what they would do if a illegal killed one of their loved ones
You Rock President Trump!! We need all them Democrats outta there!! Life would be so Much easier if they were!! God Bless You Mr. Trump!!
Build the wall and make cannabis legal again!2020!

There is enough protection at the wall now. Democrats want to open the government so 800.000 can get paid specially the ones whom work at the border it would backfire if they abandon their jobs and let border open !!
Dear Mr. President,  You‚Äôve my full support. However, you failed in tonight‚Äôs address, it‚Äôs illegal vs legal immigration! Invaders enjoying freedoms that our elders are NOT experiencing. It‚Äôs about the approximate $5,000 per month, illegals receive over our elderly and citizens! It‚Äôs a dollar for dollar. Do it LEGALLY!!!!

You have our prayers President Trump!
Use your own money to fulfill your promise if you want it so badly. Since you can relate to how you left Gov employees unpaid. You should have no problem losing some of your own money. What you dont like ramen noodles. I'm sure you will get by
Don't back down Mr. President. Build the wall. Thank you for your service and protection.... God bless you
Show me the numbers! Everything I have seen or heard says that the MAJORITY of Americans do NOT want this proposed monstrosity, while they DO want border security. If all you believe is the Trump supporters, of course they wan the wall. It‚Äôs what (their) god has commanded.

Build the wall, Mr President.

Stopping you from doing anything, like a bunch of little kids, remember those days when you were a 5,6 year old and that was your mentality-then a lot of us grew up and some didnt
Hey President; it's not "you", it's "us."  You are our AGENT.  When they come against you, they come against the whole TRUMP TRAIN.  I've read the Bible: we WILL NOT be defeated.  The crash and burn of Pelosi and crew will be dramatic and sudden, just like Korah.
I'm so proud to call you my President!! I think congress is wrong!! We need the wall and more importanly we need you President Trump. Your the best president since as far back as I can remember. Keep us the great work and dont get discouraged. God bless you!!
Jill Travassos huh
East Tennessee here build that wall üëç
I'm with wall if I'm not paying. You suck
How about having all the other 99% of the government working?
American people want security for all other international borders particularly planes coming from South East Asian countries, not just from Mexico.
Promise.  I thought the promise was Mexico paying for a wall
Republicans need to stand tough TOGETHER be REPUBLICANS for the people
Dont give in Mr. President! You are courageous! You're doing the right thing for our country!
You mean you can‚Äôt fulfill your promise and want Americans to pay for your empty promises why aren‚Äôt u making the Mexican pay like u said

Matt Smith  but I‚Äôm confused. He said Democrats are stoping him from fulfilling his promise? But his promise was that Mexico was going to build the wall?!
Stay Strong!! Everyone already knows their agenda.
Wall. We want illegals stopped. Too much of our money to support them. And foreign aid is outrageous too
Senator Ted Cruz has introduced a bill to have El chapo pay for the wall with drug money. Why this hasn't been done yet?
Build the wall don't stop until they give u the wall
Sir may you live to fulfil your promise to the people of America . You have benn a good president and I pray for more wisdom , and grace of God upon you in Jesus name
The ONLY thing they care about it defeating you, Trump.
Build the wall!  Libs will fight everything Trump wants.
I'd say put some budget in there for motion cameras.
I am under the president is trying to enforce laws congress has already put into law in 2006

Donald J. Trump does congress still get paid during a shut down? You are so right in saying most of them have fences or protection around their mansions so what is the difference? Also they brought up spending on equipment adding man power who do they think will pay for this? It‚Äôs not about a wall for them it‚Äôs about getting their way!
Jan McClendon Carter u got that right. They continue to get their pay & it‚Äôs not right.  Others are having to do without. We the people are the ones that put them in office & we just have to sit aside & let those scum bags do what they want, but something is going to have to give & some things need to be changed in Congress.

Stand firmly behind President Trump. The only president that is actually doing what he campaigned on. Whatever he hasn't done is due to obstruction from democraps and looney liberals.
the most anoying thing is having to reason and fight fools
You wouldn‚Äôt live in a house with no doors #Buildthewall
President Trump  them Democrats want the wall too , there just more worried about making you look bad and it‚Äôs a crying dam shame
Exactly right President Trump. It's called Trump derangement syndrome.
Very true....Some hate Trump more than caring about our country!
Apparently stopping you using any means necessary. We know the truth.

I hate labels but if we have to have them then I guess I‚Äôm a democrat. So let me tell you my answer to your question Mr Trump. You asked, so try listening. I would love for you to fulfill your promises!!! I keep trying to see good in what you‚Äôre doing. I want to be a fan of yours! But you never promised that we would pay for this wall. I don‚Äôt like the idea to begin with for a million reasons but I certainly don‚Äôt see our country funding it! We didn‚Äôt sign up for that. Your promise was that you‚Äôd build a wall and Mexico would pay for it. So do that. What‚Äôs more important to me? Working together to find a more reasonable solution which I‚Äôm sure is somewhere in the middle. Let‚Äôs take that money and apply it to actual crises. Border control let‚Äôs be honest is not a crisis.
Carolyn Davis  you need to check your facts. Drug trafficking is a national crisis. Human trafficking. Is real. The illegals entering our country are costing us billions of dollars annually. 1.2 billion alone just to house the illegals currently in our PENAL system. This is not including the impact to healthcare and the cost to feed and house them in our population.
Very true....Some hate Trump more than caring about our country!
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs more important to the Democrats? Stopping me from fulfilling another one of my promises or murder?‚Äù
God Bless you President Trump.
President Trump BUILD THE WALL !
Just build it, those two will never agree to anything the President  wants.
If they don‚Äôt want a wall tell them to let all all them people go live in their home
Looking  forward  to  your  address to  the  Nation  in  about  25 minutes.  I know  you'll have  a  lot  to  say.
Security without the wall perhaps.
I swear, I cannot believe the stupidity of this country...

Yes we do want border security and go to those who voted for you and we will donate money for your border security and then tell Congress to stop acting like a child worse than a child they child has more common sense than those than those than are in there now!!!!!
$46 Billion was already giving to the Democrat for the border where is it the $$$?? Trump is only asking 5 Billion  And the democrat is giving him a problem.  https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/2006-dem-senators-voted-50-billion-border-fence-2013-bigger/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=thenewvoice&utm_campaign=can&utm_content=2019-01-08
May God grant strength, wisdom and protection to our Pres. T.  It has been too many years since America has a leader like our Pres.  who has worked selflessly to repair the damage done by last admin.People had forgotten what an authentic President was like and therefore rinos refuse to appreciate what we have.  Those who love what America was built on...honoring God and Country...are grateful for our Pres. T.
Mr President stop everybody's pay until the Democrats come to their senses n that includes them. This has gone to far the Democrats are getting more people upset w our President so they get more votes next election He needs to go over their heads n put a stop to this nonsense.  Build the wall!
We need to help our own American citizens first and protect them. Securing our borders when I wall is the first line of the defense. Own citizens are facing epidemics across the country with losing their jobs and becoming homeless. We need to help our citizens first and not the legals tried to come in.
They are a total embarrassment to we the people our nation and the world!
i believe in what donald trump has done and what he is doing keep fighting for the american people and and why not make congress pay for the wall with there wages they sure make enough money they can afford it since they dont want to sign a bill for it
Just take the money and make it disappear so we can have our wall.  Obama was good at making money vanish.
Does the question even need to be asked about what the Democrats want?
Build That Wall President Trump üíñ
Does the question even need to be asked about what the Democrats want?
I think you are looking for legacy. Do what pleases you so long as it doesn't infringe on others.
That was Obama the muslim terrorists lover you thinking of . He left a legacy alright lol .

You need to get off your high horse and open up the gov't..stop holding us  USA citizens hostage by denying our paychecks and tax returns and our food supplements to fund a wall we dont need!!! Your delusional you lie about the numbers and fabricate falseness If you must have it so damn bad..pay for it out of your pocket not mine!!!
It not trump that wants the wall its america.... The government can stay shut down.... federal employees knew this could happen when they signed the employment papers....  Most of us dont get tax returns....  did you know #jayinslee blew 50 billion this year already..... with nothing to show for it.... https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1852251838156838&id=100001161185330  Also another large part of the problem is government dependancy... instead of people needing support how about you work on the cost of things and question why its so high...
Well then be my guest and pay for it out of your pocket not mine because I dont think a wall or barrier is the answer especially when there are tunnels and other ways that they will come in..if they are truly desperate enough to come in illegally... nothing will stop them..
I think you are looking for legacy. Do what pleases you so long as it doesn't infringe on others.
My FAMILY will back you STICK TO YOUR GUNS Mr PRESIDENT you your family and your Cabinet are in our Prayers
The Americans also need to be paid. I am all for the wall but not at the expense of Americans suffering
So let's take all the money confiscated in drug crime and apply it to the wall. Send all drug fellons to the other side of the wall and save the money it takes to care for them in prison to patrol the boards. Build the wall
Build the wall.   We stand with you President Trump
Please do it we need it for the safety of America!!!!
What's the need of a President if all I have to do is take him to court  and win
Americans want to be paid.
Well then be my guest and pay for it out of your pocket not mine because I dont think a wall or barrier is the answer especially when there are tunnels and other ways that they will come in..if they are truly desperate enough to come in illegally... nothing will stop them..
We are so Proud if you President Trump !
Build the Wall!!! Thank you Mr. Presidentüôå This family stands with you‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
Dont give in a promise to us the people of America.
Tis truly amazing how little many Americans actually know about the deals and other decisions Rumps has made and actual results. And remember he lost the popular vote by almost three million votes, a record for a President.
Easy. Stopping u. Clear to me and the rest of the world.
Stop buying 600.00 hammers US Gov and spend the money on a wall!!
Keep it shut Mr Trump. You can‚Äôt trust Pelosi and Schumer.
Still with you Mr President!  I don't care what the libs say or do I will stand strong with my President!
I got a great idea. For all who are against the wall let‚Äôs create a separate tax pool for them and they can pay for all the bullshit it cost the rest of us and they can open their homes to them as well. Or build the wall. Anyone wanna take a guess which one they will pick?
This wall so needs to be built.  Not just any wall, one that will do what it is intended to do.  I realize there are many immigrants that want to come to this country, but it seems that most of them end up on Welfare and receive benefits.  If they want to come, do it legally!  Build the WALL now.
shmeer and pelosiesssss are so wrong ...
Don't cave Pres. They don't care about our country. Just staying in power is what they crave! Term limits!!!
The FEMA camps conspiracy theory holds that the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is planning to imprison US citizens in concentration camps.[1][2][3] This is typically described as following the imposition of martial law in the United States after a major disaster or crisis. In some versions of the theory, only suspected dissidents will be imprisoned. In more extreme versions, large numbers of US citizens will be imprisoned for the purposes of extermination as a New World Order is established.  The conspiracy theory has existed since the late 1970s but it has picked up greatly in popularity with the advent of the internet and social media platforms.[1]  About FEMA	Edit  Main article: Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA is a United States government agency tasked with the effective management of major emergencies within the country, including ensuring the continuity of government during a large-scale disaster such as a nuclear war. It provides federal relief to areas afflicted by natural disasters.[4]  The precursor agency to FEMA was the Federal Civil Defense Administration established by President Harry S. Truman in 1950 pursuant to executive order #10186.[5]  FEMA was established in 1979 under executive order by President Jimmy Carter. It was established to coordinate the response to a major disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms local and state authorities.[6]  In 2002 it was finally codified into law and made a component of the Department of Homeland Security. As well as providing large-scale emergency-management, FEMA is also the largest flood-insurer in the United States, mainly because most private insurance companies don't offer flood-insurance.[7]  Proponents of the conspiracy theory argue FEMA's mission is a cover up for real purpose ‚Äî to assume control of the United States following a major disaster or threat ‚Äî and that the organization is 'the executive arm of the coming police state'
Stopping you, they look like 3rd graders at this point it‚Äôs hilarious. ‚ÄúQue liberal tears now‚Äù
How about the health care you said we have the day you took office. Better and cheaper Donny that's what you said, still waiting.
Take the House of Representatives pay away instead of a Government shut down. They are over paid and don't let them collect Social Security or any other benefits.
Feeling so secure MR.PRESIDENT  YOU  OUT SMART THEM EVERY-TIME .
also due what ted cruz wanted to due take the seiuzed drug money from mexico and pay for the wall there should be enough money from that and that means mexico would be paying for it
I got a great idea. For all who are against the wall let‚Äôs create a separate tax pool for them and they can pay for all the bullshit it cost the rest of us and they can open their homes to them as well. Or build the wall. Anyone wanna take a guess which one they will pick?
Mr. President, please stand your ground on securing our boarders. We are with you!!!
Can you be our Prime Minister Mr. President?
Mr. President, please stand your ground on securing our boarders. We are with you!!!
Marcus Bryant wtf are you on drugs
Larry Boydston well, god loves sinners so Trump must be loved
Marcus Bryant wtf are you on drugs
Yes we . Keep up the great work Mr. President. We have your back
Declare a national emergency and BUILD THE WALL. I'm for term limits to. Get them out.
Now lets focus on the goverment shut down
How about a wall of humans that get paid and  are more effective at stopping illegals from entering. 5 Billion would create a lot of jobs.
Americans don‚Äôt want the wall and you refuse to negotiate in good faith. So who‚Äôs the real one responsible for the government shutdown? You.
May i borrow money. I may not get paid this Friday due to the shut down but I‚Äôm still going to work each day.  I will need gas to continue to work with no pay and lunch and dinner is a nice extra.  I can move most of the items due this pay to then end of the month in hopes we get paid then but there are late fees for this humm, govt shut down.  Is there another idea?
What is more important to them is there new world order and death to America ... call on us to end them!
Larry Boydston well, god loves sinners so Trump must be loved
Sir please l beg u Mr president, for the sake of God. I love your administration in Usa. Mr president sir, l wish to be a citizen in American.
Build the wall. God bless you president trump. Make America great again. üëç
Just pay border patrol executive order that would make sense
Am in love with the administration of Mr president, Donald trump. Go ahead God is with you and ur family.
I mean it‚Äôs obvious that anything Trump tries to do, Libtards immediately resist.
It's personal Mr Trump it's only because it's you. Take away their checks until they agree to what the people want ,the wall.
I don‚Äôt even have to guess the answer to that question; it is obvious.
You are right Mr. President.. Thank you to keep up fighting for USA..
Is that the same fox news that caught you lying about statistics?
Pls Mr president, u can do all things through Christ that strengthens you. God is with you sir, l want visa to be in usa l am from Nigeria. This is my number, 07030426201.

Obama used executive orders on everything why can't trump?
Jaye Jay Trump signed more executive orders in his first year than Obama did in 8!  Check your facts
Is that the same fox news that caught you lying about statistics?
Thank You Mr President! Build The Wall !!
BUILD THE WALL!!! LET'S GIT'R DONE SON!!!!
We want the wall! Dems are crazy. They dont even make any sense at all.
Do what you need to do Mr Trump! Were with you!
I'm thrilled we have a President with an actual brain that works. So very thankful!
Keep sharing!!  https://www.gofundme.com/TheTrumpWall
Time to come together. Ditch politics. They smell! Time to take America back!
They just want to stop what your doing mr president.   That is all they care about
Jaye Jay Trump signed more executive orders in his first year than Obama did in 8!  Check your facts
I want border security and immigration reform. The same as every one of these Democrats did until they decided to take a more dictatorial route by looking to import a new party base and seeking to stuff future ballot boxes with illegal votes. You folks are everything you claim your political counterparts to be. Only worse.
The Democrats hate Trump more than they love America. ...so sad....
YES! But not a wall. The drugs are on the trucks.
56 percent of Americans do not want a wall, according to Fox News
fake news fake numbers no correct information was used during fox news
Stand your ground! That‚Äôs why we voted you in. We are behind you!
Actually, the numbers don't show it: The survey found that 56 percent of respondents do not support the president‚Äôs proposal to construct a wall along the southern border, compared to 44 percent who do.  Erecting a broad security barrier along the border is only slightly more popular, according to the poll. Only 46 percent of respondents support that proposal, while 54 percent oppose it.  A majority of U.S. voters surveyed, 58 percent, said Trump should withdraw his demand for the border funding, while 42 percent said the president ‚Äúshould not give in."
Lol. The left is in a frenzy now! # triggered. President Trump called the hypocrisy out and i loved it.   Note to Democrats, the country has spoken. BUILD THE WALL.
It‚Äôs more important for them to stop Trump from fulfilling his promise. If he wanted to plant a damn tree, they would find a reason to object to it and twist it into an attack against him.
We don‚Äôt want your wall, hurting so many people, and no longer to be our president because you are cruel, and all over a wall when other better suggestions have been made. You‚Äôre childish, a bully, and don‚Äôt listen like a spoiled child. Be helpful! Listen and learn. Stop hurting, destroying and hating people and lying.
They just want to stop what your doing mr president.   That is all they care about
Americans want their jobs back.
Stand firm!! Build the wall and keep us safe!! 2020 is in the bag!
Border security is imparrtive to keep All Americans SAFE.

May God bless and protect you as you work to protect this nation!!!!!
Quit arguing and build the dam wall..We the Americans demand it or get your butt kicked out next term...We have had enough..
I want a border fence/wall built on the southern border. Don't listen to Chucky and Nancy. America first!
Democrats have given us 30 years of lip service on immigration  it's time for action no more discussions.

Instead of a wall, how about a electrified fence...
If we don't build it "They Will Come"
Perhaps there are a few thousand Handy Manny‚Äôs waiting for asylum that can help build the wall?
The FCC has laws against using TV to purposely mislead the viewing public. I'll be calling them tomorrow after all of your lies are spoken tonight.
Your campaign promise was that Mexico was paying for the wall.  So why do you want billions from our govt  to lay for it
I thought Mexico paying for it was your promise? üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Border security > supporting illegal immigrants
Its not about political advantage.  Logically, building the wall is the wrong thing to do.  In this matter, breaking your promise is making the US tax payer pay for the wall.
What‚Äôs important is re-opening the government, not building an unnecessary wall.
Democrats have given us 30 years of lip service on immigration  it's time for action no more discussions.
We just want the government up and running. Do the right thing.
Get Mexico to pay for it like you promised.
Keep up the great work you are doing n we the people are standing with you. Build the wall. Prayers are with you. üòäüôèüèª
Protect Americans by giving the back their jobs back! You started it!
I don't like people not getting paid or on furlough but you have to stand your ground on this or the democrats will block you for the next few years. Stay the course, we are with you.
This is why he will be our president next term 2  Build the wall
Your promise was ‚ÄúMexico will pay for the wall‚Äù
U just are trying to protect  your image..con man
President Trump. You are right. Americans want the wall. Nancy and Chuck are hypocrites. Please dont settle. Stand your ground. That is after all why we chose you. To fight back against the deep state and corruption in Washington.
You promised Mexico will pay for it! #veteran

I'm a American and Trump has my vote to build the WALL and make the family's of the American people safe from the illegal immigration. The Democrats are refusing Define border security that is a fact and they have no remorse or sympathy for the victims that have been affected illegal immigration. The presidential debate that just went live to the whole nation just showed us that our government it's not for the American people and for themselves I'm with Trump 100% because he is not one of those lying cheating politicians that only care for themselves and how big their wallet gets.
Build the wall never forget the American people are with you
Yes, all of us we need SECURITY.  God bless you PRESIDENT  DONALD TRUMP.
I say mr president stand your ground build that wall
Hilary was right. Judging by these comments anf views... you are the deplorables
Just play some of Chuck's immigration speeches on prime time. You know the ones where he agrees with POTUS
Americans want border security
Build the WALL!!!!  Please stay STRONG!!!
Americans want border security
Ryan Allberry why don't we build the wall and and save 147.8 billion a year and house our vets and help the American citizens? Hmmm spend 5 billion to save 147.8 billion. Doesn't take a genius to figure that out.
It will cost around 70 billion, where are the actually statistics to prove that number and helping out vets has been a consistent problem for decades
Just play some of Chuck's immigration speeches on prime time. You know the ones where he agrees with POTUS
Keep fighting for our safety. This has gone to a ridiculous level and parties need to stop fighting you as OUR elected president and work to make our country safe and pay OUR employees. Thank you for what you do and for sacrificing your peace and for taking the hit for our country. We needed someone who isn‚Äôt a politician running our country and you have done this.  You have never pretended to be anyone different than who you are and as an American citizen that voted for you, I appreciate this character trait. Please stand strong and fight the good fight. Clearly Americans have spoken by raising the money we have. Thank you Mr. President and God bless you!
Yes we do sir! Build the wall and protect us!
Stand proud and with the people Mr President.
I hope it is worth it. Husband is out of work only working 3 of the 4 days. He works at the Truman Library. Maybe you could give us a loan. We support you and believe that we need a wall. Thanks for thinking of us and protecting us with this wall. They need to hurry up though we still have bills. (mortgage, utiltites etc).
Good luck tonight, Mr. President!! Me and my entire family are rooting for you and standing with you on the wall and the rest of your agenda. We are praying very hard for you every day. Give ‚Äòem Hell, Sir!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
No one polled me and want the Southern border wall. Don‚Äôt believe 59% of All Americans don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm glad to hear the speech tonight. Dems are spewing hate language in their speech!
President Trump it's almost income tax time why don't you ask for donations when people file for their income tax. because I know a lot of people will be willing to do it and you can get the money for the wall that way. And the heck with the Democrat politicians
Mexico 're ready to pay for it!
It will cost around 70 billion, where are the actually statistics to prove that number and helping out vets has been a consistent problem for decades
Trump On Baby!!! BUILD THAT WALL, DO NOT CAVE!!!
I support you Mr. President through and through!!! Stick to your guns!!!
We know the answer to that question.
Arrest and try representatives that do not representatives the American people.
Show me where it allows for that in the Constitution.  Without it being Constitutionally binding, it would be a waste of time and money. Remember, Democrats have been promising  African Americans better schools, less crime, and more jobs to bring them out of poverty since the 1960s.
Build that wall. Stipulations: All US citizen workers and all materials Made in the USA!
Keep your promise President Trump
Stand strong President Trump, I am with you 100%!  Build the wall, we need it badly!
You haven't fulfilled 1...Make Mexico pay for your wall like you infactily  said & promised...was that a lie?
Take our country back President Trump!  We are behind you 100 percent!
Stopping you from keeping the promise you made. They are still upset about loosing and if you keep your promise it makes their politicians look bad.
Amen, go for the wall.   San Diego California supports you sir.
More important to them is stopping you.  Definitely do not care about American citizens.  And WHY should them be given air time?  They do not run this country  - are people afraid to tell them NO?
They only have one objective and its to be against the President in any way possible. They arent there for the people they represent. Its all about protecting the corruption they have had secreted from the people of our country. And it has gone beyond mere politics, but into a huge drive of hate pitting people against people, against law enforcement, against races, even the history of this country and more. I have respect for country and our President. He is there in office because people still believe in our country and someone like Mr.Trump that wants to make things better. He got there on his own, without any help, beyond the peoples' vote. Think how much could actually be accomplished for everyones betterment if they worked with him and give him the opportunity to work with them. It could become the greatest time in history for our country.
Build the wall President Trump!
Uhhhhh you said Mexico will be paying for it !!  #Dementia
We need this wall! Dems let the president have the funds he needs!
Thank you for standing up for Americans, Mr President! Build that wall!
You haven't fulfilled 1...Make Mexico pay for your wall like you infactily  said & promised...was that a lie?

Dont back down ever.... We The People want that wall
I have not seen either on the white house fb page or your personal pages the announcement about being on tv tonight to discuss state of the union national security/immigration issues.

Americans want a president. Go home.
Nic, He is home for the next six years. Ha Ha
Thomas, I sincerely doubt he‚Äôll last his full first term. By his own hand. Ha. Friggin. Ha.
I have not seen either on the white house fb page or your personal pages the announcement about being on tv tonight to discuss state of the union national security/immigration issues.
Thomas, I sincerely doubt he‚Äôll last his full first term. By his own hand. Ha. Friggin. Ha.
No wall!! No shutdown!! USA needs a president!!
Nic, He is home for the next six years. Ha Ha
No wall!! No shutdown!! USA needs a president!!
Still waiting to see an impact on my taxes and you to "fix" health care, but you do what you do best and blame someone else for no progress.
You mean like how the reds worked so well with obama?
Dallas Smith Hey nephew sorry to bust your bubble but the blue is way way worse to our President  then we the reds were to Obama.
Americans want a president. Go home.
How about the wall around Ms Pilosis house
Take the aid 300M stopped from Pakistan and put Towards Wall !
Our priority is not WASTING 5billion on your vanity project that will do absolutely NOTHING to secure our border! You know what will? Paying our Border patrol, instead of making them work for zero pay
I believe you but what I can't believe is how many people are jumping ship because their behinds are too impatient to wait.Rome wasn't built in a day and this wall won't be either
The only thing the Democrats want to do is block President Trump's EVERY attempt to fulfill the very promises which got him elected to begin with.  They should be ashamed of themselves. The shutdown is on them.
Stop their pay and retirement benefits!
Well that‚Äôs a silly question!
Dallas Smith Hey nephew sorry to bust your bubble but the blue is way way worse to our President  then we the reds were to Obama.

Americans want border security; they don't want some damn wall!  Democrats had funding for border security in every version of a bill they have tried to pass.  You, Mr. Trump, are the one who is keeping the government shut down, not the Democrats.  You said you would sign the bill that was presented, the bill that would have kept the government open.  Who is not fulfilling their promises??  YOU!!  And because you can't keep your word, 800,000 citizens are not getting paid, have to worry how they will feed their families and pay their bills, and some are being forced to work without pay.  We want border security, not some ugly wall that will keep us in like the Soviets did to their citizens.  Open the government!!
Diane Merlock-Felts Look we have to be documented why not them. We have they have birth certificates social security cards and other mean of ID.
Stop their pay and retirement benefits!
The commies want a sommunist state, illegal immigration is a means to an end.
Trouble is Congress has to vote for it. Fox watching the henhouse.
I'm confused as to why people think the wall is a bad idea? Anyone care to enlighten me on there opinion
WRONG... Americans want affordable healthcare, infrastructure improvements, and good-paying jobs.... JUST LIKE YOU PROMISED! You can take your wall and shove it!
I don‚Äôt know about this. We could improve the Rio Grande. We could make it similar to the Panama Canal. Continue the Rio Grande all the way to the Pacific. We could use it for water treatment and barges could ship goods
A Crisis or Problem.   The degree to the response would be much different in how you respond.  Example, If I showed up at the ER in a Crisis, I would expect to be seen immediately or with some degree of urgency.  But If I showed up at the ER with a problem they would advise me to make an appointment to see my local physician in a week or so.  So do we have a border problem?  Or do we have a border Crisis?  If it is a Problem, end the Gov‚Äôt shut down and take the time to develop a comprehensive plan to address border immigration at every border entrance.  If we have a Crisis, then open the Gov‚Äôt because a border wall will take years to build and will not address a Crisis which requires immediate attention.
everytime you solve problems,the middle class suffers...think carefully before taking action please...End Shutdown
Diane Merlock-Felts Look we have to be documented why not them. We have they have birth certificates social security cards and other mean of ID.
You can fulfill your promises with the government open. You not paying the ones that voted for you will cause them to vote differently in 2020.
build the wall, maintain border security, get rid of Nancy and Chuck
No wall for you! #FakePresident #LockTrumpUp
LET THE PEOPLE VOTE ON IT ; IT'S THE DEMOCRATIC WAY !
I'm ready to help. I have strength and lots of brains.
We need the wall. Our future will be bankrupt  if e don't stop letting them in
Mr. President is the report true that there is 14 billion seized from drug cartel Joaquin ‚ÄúEl‚ÄôChapo‚Äù Guzman that could be used to fund the wall?   If so can we use it for your original plan for a concrete wall? Or is this fake news?

Why isnt mexico paying for the wall. Thats what mr trump promised?
John Fairbrother omg pay attention....they will be paying for the wall....they aren't gonna write a check for it in crayon like you people want....jesus do you know business at all
Tina Magaro Foust, I like John have not ‚Äòkept up‚Äô, although I don‚Äôt think a cheque written crayon was ever going to feature. So how exactly are they going to pay for the wall??
We need the wall. Our future will be bankrupt  if e don't stop letting them in
Yes, build the wall, protect our borders!!!!!
Very simple logic,     The biggest reason why the libtards are against the wall is,     They think that if they succeed in stopping the wall, that all of Trumps base will leave him,      SURPRISE LIBS EVEN IF HE DIDN'T GET THE WALL BUILT HIS BASE WOULD NOT CHANGE ONE BIT,
Most Americans would be happy if you would just shut the hell up.
What do the Democrats want? Sanity in government would be a good start.
Stopping Trump is more important to Chuck and Nancy than doing the job they were elected to do.
Thank you President Trump.
Secure the Border i totally agree with you and the safety for the people and our children!
Hold the line Sir!  We have your 6!!!
Your darn right Donald. We do want a wall and hope you can knock some sense into those knuckleheads so they will give you the funding.

Iam from canada and i want to see the wall .... stand strong and tall
Trump‚Äôs $5 billion is a laughable drop in the bucket for what would ACTUALLY be needed. For example, according to the Cato Institute: An estimate for a border wall area that only covered 700 miles was originally 1.2 billion. How much did it REALLY cost? SEVEN BILLION. And that‚Äôs only for 700 miles. Whatever we think it‚Äôs going to cost, experience shows us we have to multiply it by more than 500%
Why can't democrats be fired for grand standing ?when they vote no to the peoples security,they took a oath and sweated to God on the bible. Doesn't that have any meaning at all. Wait until they come up to your neighborhood !
It‚Äôs about stopping you so I would open the government and secure border without them they are going to try and stop you no matter the issue your President they‚Äôre not that‚Äôs what o would say
God put you there to stand firm for the good of the people of America. God bless President D. Trump.
You are my President. Thank You for your efforts President Trump!
The just want the space arou d them "dems" secure dont care about the pesents
Mr. President, do not back down! I support you.
They are all about stopping you Mr. PRESIDENT...we know it..we love youüíï
Praying for God to give you the strength and wisdom to protect America. Thank you President Trump.
Your darn right Donald. We do want a wall and hope you can knock some sense into those knuckleheads so they will give you the funding.
Trying to take minds from the real issues has stopped working.  Your days are numbered child in chief.
Weird only pro trump comments with lots of likes at the top of the comments ü§î
How about 45 does good on his, "Mexico is going to pay for it" or even better, 45 can pay for it himself and anyone else who donated to GoFundMe. Idiots.
Your promise was Mexico will built the wall
Your not going to stop them with technology. Ask Israel.
They will always choose what is worse for America
I‚Äôm all for the border but how many congressmen are going with  out there pay like the hardworking citizens . Seriously.
We need door to protect all house so like wise we need wall to protect our nation or we Democrat should tear out their homes door so they will kno how they feel!
Remind the folks that God is on record for making asylum seeking refugee slaves from Egypt wait 40 years to enter the promised land.

Trump wants a dictatorship

All forms of entry, not just Mexico border.
Dems have painted themselves into a corner.  They cannot save face unless they make sure no wall gets built.  Even if it means the government stays in a partial shutdown for years.  Though he'd declare an emergency, a court would immediately rule he can't, and it would go to the supreme court which would say he can, and he'd built the wall with the military before "years" happens.  And we'd have a wall AND a partially-shut-down government!  Unless Schumer/Pelosi agree to lose face for the good of the country (and you know where freezes over while we're at it).
Build the wall. To much diversity in this country . it's called United states of America let's be united
Guess we just better build that wall !!!!
President Trump is a man of his word and democrats can't take that from him
I believe most of this democrat blocking the wall funding has fences on their homes, has locks on their door's, why blocking border wall for internal security
Yes it will. Kathy hope your not a dem. The president has done more than any other pres. He's keeping his promises. All the others talk bull.

I sand with you on Securing the Border Mr. President. What they did was inexcusable.
It‚Äôs like watching Shrek the movie in the scene where Fiona says ‚Äúohhh √† talking donkey and Shrek responds ya it‚Äôs trying to make him shut up the key‚Äù DT you need a Golden Shower from the top of any wall
I can tell you why the Democrats wont deal with trump they are afraid if they do trump will brag that he won and make them feel like losers they care more about them selves and way they would look then they do about the American people to which that's why they where voted in to help Americans not them shelves . give trump the money quit playing these damn games with American lives .........
Border security is critical for a nations sovereignty. Period. Get it done ‚úÖ  #protectsouthernborder
Stop their paychecks. Stop their insurance stop their body gaurds. Stop everything until they agree
He is not the best president can't you guys see what's going on what he's doing to this country he lies about everything
+1 for Trump. The left has done what? At least he is keeping his promise trying to protect America. Enough is Enough. All the left does is talk, never follows through. $50B to other countries....????
Your promise was for Mexico to pay for the wall.
Ginger Snow yes we do.
Your promise was for Mexico to pay for the wall.
Wait until we have our government car the car that's generic that parts are interchangeable and easily upgraded yes upgrading two different style bodies years exedra

Just think Obama gave away phones how about you make people earn cars a safe secure reliability with your name on it the Trump mobile
4k strip down 13 Inc tires  old jeep block you can salvage the blocks from junk yards
You can put the car on the Social Security account we all know we can get access to that account
More of a point system calculate the Good Deeds throughout the day
EMP resistant cars
You know as well as I know you don't want a bunch of stranded people
so it's either you fix the Auto industry are you just take it over
Whatever money we paid out that's that's payment for takeover taxpayers paid it give it give it back to us
+1 for Trump. The left has done what? At least he is keeping his promise trying to protect America. Enough is Enough. All the left does is talk, never follows through. $50B to other countries....????
A car that's interchangeable with engines and drive shafts electric gas diesel stick shift
The ultimate and economics affordability and accessibility four-wheel drive 6 wheel drive yes extendable drive shaft trailer rear ends
The car has to be set on a platform like Qanon Mopar  can run program
I'm not asking for a handout I'm asking for an easy way out something something simple and not complexed
The car has to be set on a platform like Qanon Mopar  can run program
Notice how Schumer looks us in the eyes, but did not look the president in the eyes in the meeting a few weeks ago! And Shcumer lies, so does Pelosi! Happy that you mentioned that many congressional and Hollywood types have walls around their homes Keep the shut down, build the wall!
The ultimate and economics affordability and accessibility four-wheel drive 6 wheel drive yes extendable drive shaft trailer rear ends
Keep doing the right thing for America and all of us who know and believe you are doing the right thing. Amen
Call and tell Nancy to pound sand.. Build the dam wall.
Literal shut down cause our government is too busy playing ‚Äúwho‚Äôs got a bigger dick‚Äù in the White House.
Please, secure that border!  May our living God be with you!
Your promise was that Mexico would pay for it.
How many times have the FBI or CIA advised a wall on the southern border?
Sign a Executive Order why we are shutdown you don't get paid.Put that in there plpe and smoke it !!!
Come live here and you‚Äôll see that‚Äôs a fiction

I also just want to go back to work it's is not doing good for my house payment car payment and much more food ex
It isn‚Äôt about you Mr.President look at the drug money and who stands to loose the most. Sanctuary cities will go Bankrupt when you stop the flow of drugs and money..I love you
But democrats are saying to the public that you are lying!
I think we know the answer to that question..   stand tough President Trump !!  We are worth it !
Build the WALL the true Americans are with you President Trump, protect us and God will continue  to Bless you.
If they are right and we don't need a wall, then why do we need the TSA?
Love the job you are doing! Build the damn wall!
Come live here and you‚Äôll see that‚Äôs a fiction
Love the job you are doing! Build the damn wall!
I want a secure nation. Every country had the right to protect itself. If you don't believe that why do people lock their doors? I remember a time we didn't until nighttime. If you don't believe in a border keep your doors to you home open 24/7!
If they are right and we don't need a wall, then why do we need the TSA?
Please secure the Border Mr. President!
Take a walk through the desert üåµ please!
Israel's wall is considered to be a security barrier against terrorism, stopping waves of violence, and protecting it's citizens. Don't we as American citizens deserve to be protected also.
The only thing missing from this whole debate about the wall... Is not having Michael Moore chime in.
Doesn't matter what he would say,  want,  or propose.  Because it's him,  they'll fight it.  Anything he does they'll fight.  Sickening.  Keep it shut down.  Build it.
Praise God for a President who has the intestinal fortitude to protect us!!! This problem should not be a political issue to Politicians on both parties as they have made it for ‚Äú their  own Gain‚Äù! I am a supporter of immigration but people must do it the legal way!!! Built the wall President as we have too many problems created by open borders.
I don‚Äôt see any saying build a wall around Canada. It‚Äôs all BS.
The wall is the dumbest idea ever. They can still go over or under. A wall that cost 25.6 billion dollars make no sense. But what happen to Mexico paying.
I want a secure nation. Every country had the right to protect itself. If you don't believe that why do people lock their doors? I remember a time we didn't until nighttime. If you don't believe in a border keep your doors to you home open 24/7!
Stay strong Mr. PRESIDENT and dont gove in...build the wall
Do it like how it is at Area 51... with the buried sensors and lots of armed camodudes... effective and cost efficient.
They keep saying you arent doing what a normal President does, that's right that's why we are in the mess we are in, and they want more of the same? Really, you are here doing what you said so you keep on doing what got you elected and not what all the haters want. You will win, don't give in and I am still loving that Kelly Ann  called Jim  a smart ass today lol
I am for Trump, but wasn't his promise Mexico would pay for the Wall ?
STAND TALL MR PRESIDENT!! BUILD THE WALL!!!
If you lock them up they will learn quick, that prison wall work every time!
Why doesnt trump stop allowing the govt to send 5 billion a week to Afghanistan the govt your so gung ho for is the same one funding every war and allowing our service men and women to die everyday. Get real people.
Making sure ends meet and the domestic budget doesn't peak before the head of state hemorages more billions on overseas loans. He might want to consider offsetting the national debt with a threat to build a wall around Wall Street before they wreak more havoc on an overstretched economy thats rapidly running out of money.
Stand strong President Trump we are behind you all the way.
They complain the country is devided......they complain everything trump is doing is political. ......question when waa the last time a president addressed the nation and the other party immediately ask for tv time to rebut everything our president said. Have some respect mr schumer in mrs pelosi or atleast a little class. Political yes u made it political otherwise u wouldn't have jumped on tv right away
The wall is the dumbest idea ever. They can still go over or under. A wall that cost 25.6 billion dollars make no sense. But what happen to Mexico paying.
They just wanna go opposite what ever Republicans wants. Even knowing that will hurt American citizens, I am so confused. Why they have to do this ?
Stand firm sir, we must have the Wall.
I think you should finish your promise to drain the swamp first. Drain the swamp in all states. Then you won‚Äôt have any resistance.
all this garb with the democrats has given me an extreme insight. (((((((((GO PRESIDENT TRUMP)))))))))))))))
Keep up the great work President Trump!!!  We voted for this wall and you!!!
Build the wall Mr President! We stand with you !
Listen to Barack Obama speach and proposal of 2014 that was not supported, it is awesome.

Please Build the WALL TALL and LONG Mr. President. Thank You!
I prefer God‚Äôs promises be kept! I don‚Äôt care at all about President Trump‚Äôs promise being kept. He‚Äôs just a man! God alone is wise!
Exactly. We must secure the Southern Border now more than ever. Times are more dangerous and drugs poor in daily.
Mr President please don‚Äôt give up build our wall

Build the wall!! Stay strong Mr. President Trump!!!! Thank u for standing up for us Americans!!! The Democrats are terrorists!! They dont care about Americans at all!
Do not waste the money on the wall. It will not stop anything. Money needs to be used for the needs of Vets. Health Care, Michigan etc.
Dur durrrrrrp dur durp durp ok üêíhere have üçå
Just like drill baby drill impacted oil prices, build baby build.
Here's a thought. Imagine you live in a new place. Imagine how beautiful your life is you have wonderful neighbors. The birds are chirping the sun is shinning. You go into your house and you find out on the news there has been a catastrophe. Now remember you live inside the wall. The president comes on and says he will implement Marshall law. Now depending on what the situation you may be required to stay in your home. If you try to go out lethal forced my be used. Now you have rights but at this time you are under marshal law. You have no food and your water has stopped. You can't go out to find out what is wrong or ask for help. 911 is off and the president is only telling you what you want to hear about the situation. Your children need food water and medical and you are confined to your home. Oh and for fun we will take away the right to bare arms also. You go out to get help because you have no other choice, you need help for you and your loved ones, you are killed or better yet taken into custody. Or you want to leave the U.S. because everyone is sick or you don't even know what is going on. Now after that thought I have to ask myself which side of the wall do I want to be on? I know its frustrating wanting to keep people out but I don't see people wondering about the possibility of having to stay inside the wall. Look up the definition of a reservation check your history fact before you decide if you want to live on a reservation too.
President Trump we need border security, thank you for sticking to your promises.
Stay strong Mr. President! You have my support!
If Democrats would work with President Trump, they would gain a lot of respect.....
Stand your ground. We need border security
We support you Mr. President. Declare the state of emergency and let's get the wall done.
Build that wall! Behind you in Indiana 100 percent!!!!
I don‚Äôt want the wall, I have family in Mexico
Do not waste the money on the wall. It will not stop anything. Money needs to be used for the needs of Vets. Health Care, Michigan etc.
We really need to build the wall in the border.
Proverbs 16:6 King James Version (KJV)  6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.
Go ahead, Mr. President, and build the wall...We're behind you 100% AND WILL STAY BEHIND YOU, no matter what the Dems do!!!
As long as Mr. Trump works in prayer, I am sure that if it's in God's line and God had planned that it would be, surely,the wall will be built. May God's will be done.  I am praying for him(President.)  May God bless the USAüá∫üá∏
If you need an experienced Project Mananger reach out
Do not cave---I called all of our congressmen today. Did You??? please call your's and let them know to stand with the President
democrat's vote for wall when they knew it wouldn't be built. But they know Trump will build it and that's the facts.
If amricans need wall but human need humanity don't be ra***
El chapo. Use his 14 billion to fund the wall.
I don‚Äôt want the wall, I have family in Mexico
behind  you president Trump stand strong praying for you
It's all about prevent Trump from succeeding. They refuse to even negotiate or offer alternate ideas for border security. But Trump is acting like a child and solely to blame for the shutdown... Dumbocrats!
seriously. That is a negotiating tactic with Mexico. It is cost effective and will pay for itself with less people to process.
Yes Mr. President  We want the wall
If they ain't funding it, the public will...
Why did Democrats get time after your speech? So wrong. Schumer has been in office since ‚Äò81 and Pelosi since ‚Äò87. All they do is get rich. They self serve rather than sacrificially serve. They were undeserving of equal time. They‚Äôve had nothing but time!
We Want Border Security!!!! Every Nation should have borders!!!  We stand with you Mr. President!!! El Chap was arrested, use the money he had and all drug money caught coming across the border!  That way Mexico does pay for the wall! Or Tax all remittance leaving the country! We want the wall!!
Ur doing a good job mr trump keep up the work
Most of us know the answer is; both. #ILOVEMYPRESIDENT
El chapo. Use his 14 billion to fund the wall.
The internet polls I've seen reflect support for the wall by over 80 %.
Take away the democrats security guards, and see how they feel. BUILD THE WALL SECURE OUR BORDERS
Protect the border build that wall protect America it's the only way to stop the illegals from getting in.
Build a wall on your northern border.
Since we are giving Mexico Federal Aid money, can we ask them to build a wall on their side of the border with the money we give them? It would also create jobs there...
Congress should give up their visiting protocols, security cameras, guards and chauffeurs and then say a word about the WALL...War Against Lies and Liens
Proposal of Nation wide fence ban at next meeting! Start with government buildings and elected officials homesüêÇüí©
Build the wall with cartel money. Use all the drug money coming over the boarder. El Chap had money. Use it to build the wall!!!
We want the wall President Trump! Thank you  üôÇ
Most of us know the answer is; both. #ILOVEMYPRESIDENT
Stand firm, Mr. President! We are behind you!
What‚Äôs more important to you‚Äîfulfilling a very bad promise, very weak solution, or doing the right thing for America?
Wait a minute what about all the known ISIS terrorist camps that are in the United States across our country. Confirmed by the FBI. Mr. President Donald Trump when you gonna do something about that and all the jihadist terrorist in our country
Thank you Mr President.  Build the wall!
Build the wall - the sooner the better!!
Dems are never going to become moral, responsible, ethical adults.
Their power security is more important than our border security  to them.
We have to be with our president who want the best for us and our country do not get paid the congress no checks until they approve what you need for our protection .do what you have to do   you are the president of this country Donald Trump
Tell Congress to go home, because they have done nothing since they started except obstruct.  So why are we paying them?
We want the wall President Trump! Thank you  üôÇ
Secure our borders. Quite spending money helping foreign countries use the money for our security
Mr. President, We the People need you to declare war on the democrats and immigration. This way they those idiots that oppose you can then be charged with treason given their actions; Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and ...
God bless USA with abundant blessing
YOU ARE RIGHTMR. PRESIDENT  WE WANT THE WALL. WE BACK YOU 100%
Can't wait to see what *cough* totally not fake news you're going to tell us.
Over power and over rule you don't need them it is a national emergency that's been going on for to long. I'm tired of giving these aliens our jobs and freebies. Go get um #Trump 2020
Why is ‚ÄúGetting rid of Trump‚Äù not one of the choices?  That‚Äôs what America wants.
The only problem I see with the wall is making the American people pay for it why not just raise taxes on Mexican Imports since every car in America comes from there anyway maybe use that money to pay for the wall and you should paint the Mexican side camouflage so they can't see it to climb over
I want the border secured. This is stupid. Legislators need to get off their lazy entitled butts and do the job they were elected to do.
Tell Congress to go home, because they have done nothing since they started except obstruct.  So why are we paying them?

Clearly stopping President Trump based on tonight‚Äôs broadcast!  Build the fence, protect America!  The Experts want it, listen to them. üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ USA
We should also build a wall between Mexico and south America since the use Mexico as away into the us I bet half the people or majority the border patrol catches are from South America.

We want real border security not a wall! Security that includes fully staffing and PAYING our border security officers and TSA officers!!
Your doing a great job mr president  You can't tie your shoes if your hands are tied behind your back.
Sen Graham one of the few sane in that  congress!  Where are the  ‚ÄúOld West‚Äù guys  when we need them?
Kamala Harris calls the wall "a vanity project." For one to want national security at the border is now vanity in a country according to her. Americans just want immigrants to be like them, legal.
I guess democrats are not American.
Take Congress pay checks away they are paid to much and get benefits that our veterans need and deserve
My family is praying for you and your family, Mr. President.  Thank you for fighting for America and her citizens.  You will get 4 votes from my family in 2020.
Speak the truth for once in your life and perhaps people will be willing to work with you.
True Story !!!  The democrats are more interested in destroying you, than in what's in the best interests of our country !!!  I've never seen anything like it !!!  The democrats need to have their HEADS EXAMINED !!!
Keep our citizens safe.  Build the Wall!
Build the Fricken Wall. Tall and Deep !!  Just do it
Pay no attention to the negative comments from the false Americans they are democrats or foreigners who went back on their alegence to America
James Macleod you have the right to disagree and speak your but not to go against our laws and constitution so stick it
Build the Fricken Wall. Tall and Deep !!  Just do it
Your promise was that the American people will not pay for yet I've been or of work for 3 weeks because of your huge ego and tiny prick.
Obviously the former - since day one ‚Äî EGO!!!!
Your promise was Mexico was going to pay for it
That's it, they will block everything you try. O didn't do a single thing that was good for the country, instead he ramrodded hurtful legislation, hurting our democracy too. Thanks for not being a baby like him.
Fund it with El Chapo funds? Is that feasible?
Do you even need to ask? Lock them up for Sedition and get on with business. Simple.
The promise was that Mexico was going to pay for it. Why should our taxes pay for it now? As much as I would like to see you impeached, I would much rather see you indicted after your term in office.
Mr President, you can use my tax dollars for the wall üíØ
James Macleod you have the right to disagree and speak your but not to go against our laws and constitution so stick it
Can Mexico pay 50% of the total cost? Can Mexico support the funding to help their people in the US. Can their Embassy pay for all the cost to help their people?
President Trump...it's all about throwing a fit so you can't help out America. So very shameful.  Keep up the great job!
I believe your "promise" was mexico will pay for your monument to yourself. #SAD
Thank you for your hard work in office.  We are proud of you.  You build, we'll pray.
Most of America sees the idiocy represented by the democrats. They are signing their on demise as a party in Congress
Israel has walls and Heaven has walls and gates too
Did you forget the Mexico is paying for it ???!!!
Stand strong Mr. President. We are with you 100 percent.
Nobody has ever argued against border security!! The ‚Äúwall‚Äù‚Äô extending from coast to coast that you wanted Mexico to pay for is the problem!!
Thank you mr president  You doing EXACTLY what needs to be done for this country  I'll be there in 2020
Mr President, you can use my tax dollars for the wall üíØ
Build the wall thank you Mr president.
Dems would still oppose Trump no matter what, blind hate is such a useless thing.
Mr president I want a let‚Äôs make America great again hats
How about starting with a partial bill that just covers essential workers pay.  Do not want to take out a loan to pay bills.
Why not show what‚Äôs happening at the border now live. Show people that are clueless how bad it is.  I‚Äôm all for the wall. We need more security as a country.
Take the money from Foreign Aid! We spent $50B+ last year. Just cut that aid.
Canadian here... You have one hell of a great PRESIDENT!!!
Don"t back down Mr.Trump! BUILD THE WALL!!! to keep our country safe!!

The wall is to keep you in !
Top you Mr. President fulfilling another promises
American want security, it's right but is not the Wall the correct way. I'm Sorry President.
Do not give in, build the wall, we stand with you.
I vote to build the wall!   Not only for security but also the endless benefits we pay with our tax dollars to support the ILLEGALS for years and years.  We need to make laws to fight the Boarder crisis and make our Boarder laws effective, fix DACA, and to have laws made to secure Boarder that make sense. It‚Äôs  only common sense to fix the Southern Border. It‚Äôs time to do what is right for our American citizens!
Or how about getting new Democrat votes?  Illegals tend to vote that way.
Legalize cannabis and build a big wall with that revenue mr. President.
Build a base, use service folks who can not find employment when discharged, drones, that gives employment and  guards the boarder. Just saying
Americans like me want to start getting paid again .... how about this!
Don‚Äôt flinch to their political game! Don‚Äôt flinch Mr President we are proud of you!
Let the people vote on it!!
When will you ppl wake up?! These elite bastards have less in common with you than the people you're trying to block off with the wall...
Yea STUPIT DemsüëøThey don't care about usüò§
This kind of stuff leads to revolution asked the French.
President Trump you are doing a great job,if the democrats would stop acting like kids I believe this could be a great country again
Out of all the president's in my lifetime I would love to shake Trump's hand.
You should be ashamed of yourself. I have no idea how you sleep at night. Pathetic to use fear to control. Shame.
I want the government to quite thinking about power and money and there own pockets and do whats best for the people and work together to get this figured out. This is becoming rediculouse how democrats cant just come to a compromise.
God bless our best president.you worked so harder.we are proud of you.
Americans like me want to start getting paid again .... how about this!
They stopped with Fake News, now they are telling the truth, already dictated in campaigns, it is now until 2020.
Stop building all these walls that they can climb over.
Supplement the victims of the furlough
Offer the Democrats a 3 year deal on the wall- if there is no noticeable positive changes, we‚Äôll take it down.
Yes Mr President, please stand strong and build the wall. I want my children and my grandchildren to be safe from these terrorists. Also I'm praying for you and your family! God bless you.
They care more about stopping you. They‚Äôve been trying to impeach you from the start.

If you don‚Äôt want border security your house and property should always be open and available to all strangers, at your own personal cost.
Just do what you promised the good people of America.
If the elephant and the donkey are fighting only the people of America suffer I thought it was America first and not the wall first
We need a wall. You know it and so do many others. Just the typical democrat crip crap. And tell kellyanne Conway nice job yesterday. We may be related but I doubt it.
If they don't want a wall what would they like.
Lining their pockets with the $54 billion that they ‚Äú want for foreign aide‚Äù. Riiggghhhhtttt. Can you SPECIAL INTEREST?!
Take away their pay and see what happens

Yes Americans want the wall and we love our President
We are turning against g each other because of our differing views about this wall....face it, this is gonna get worse. Already, the food stamp program will be short next month that and they have no funding for March. The Government t workers most likely are having to rely on family to help make their car and house payments. I don't know what the solution is, but we need to help our fellow Americans. The economy is gonna begin to slow. People other than Government  workers are gonna be without work due to this. People won't afford their wonderful government insurance premiums and won't be able to afford healthcare. I'm not saying the Wall is foolish. I support the Wall. But it's about to get rough America. For all of us.
Thank you Mr. President for all you are doing to help protect us.
Absolute joke of a president...
We the people voted for this president and won! Build the wall
Funny watching Pelosi and Schumer up there jumping up and down like crybabies
Helga Destefano Let them live there!!
Here is what I would like to see: every federal employee whose pay you‚Äôre holding hostage to go on strike or walk out on their jobs.
Why is it always fox news?   If the majority of Americans want something,  more sources would say it
We always with you....give a head mr president..godbless
I understand Mr. President stated he expected Mexico to help pay for the wall and now there are those who say he flopped on a promise.  I wish those people would consider that Mexico is dealing with the caravan at this point.  This was an unforseen expense.  The wall will pay for itself.
Keep it shut make them not take a paycheck
I agree build the wall it will help it will slow down illegal immigration and any immigrant that wants to take the proper action of obtaining there citizenship that's fine come on but build the wall
We know it‚Äôs to fight you know matter what. They don‚Äôt care about Americans.
We don't need to another 9/11! It's scary to think so many Americans have forgotten why we need protection!

Even having the money that has been confiscated doesn't automatically allocate it to that particular budget funding. It must still be approved by congress no matter where the money comes from. Doesn't haven't to be the specific taxpayer money, how much did Obama send Iran again? Oh yeah, it was billions as well of our taxpayer money. As a government employee household of 35 years I can assure you first hand the government wastes far more than that just in idle hand-wrenching and not making a decision? Why didn't they fix this crap when they had control for so many years exactly? Do you know? They don't want to for their own agenda's and now more than ever simply because of stupid blind hate of Trump for no real actual reason any worse than anything any other president has ever done in their lifetime. Kennedy was a womanizer if that's your beef and everyone knew it, but overlooked it. Character issues, let's don't trot out all of Bill's as we just don't have that much time left in this world now do we. Please, get an actual real reason to not want better border security, a better economy for all, left and right sides, beside the lame and whimpy "I just can't stand Trump" and would rather see our country go down in flames than agree with him. How very childish.
Yay, finally an intelligent American !!!  My message to Donald Trump :   ‚ÄúSure, border security !!! But that does not necessarily mean a 5 billion dollar wall !!! The Democrats also want border security ... but not the 5 billion dollar wall that you are proposing for border security !!! You need to learn how to negotiate and compromise !!! You are used to bullying until you get your own way !!! You have no respect or consideration for the other people with whom you are negotiating !!! You are 71 but you act like a child who hasn‚Äôt learned that he cannot always have his own way !!! You need to grow up !!! I hope the Democrats don‚Äôt let you get away with your bullying ways so that you may learn how to be a mature individual !!! Otherwise you need to be removed from circulation because people like you are a menace and not worthy of living in society with other people ...‚Äù
Saige Turner You don't have a clue do you.  Those coming across the border and working are being paid in cash which they send home to their familys.  I've seen it happen many times.  They pay NO social security.  They don't even have legal Social Security cards.  Idiot!!!
Arev Neerg your so wrong .you need to grow up. we need the wall. you don,t know whats going on in this country. .
Susan Eidoen the ones that the groups are sending in are giving fake ss numbers, id,s and are able to vote as long as they vote dem giving a certain number to use so when they work they can file taxes. true facts. another group is coming in and told what to say. bless this country..

I say wait for the checks to come in from Mexico.ü§î
he said mexico AND canada are already paying for it through the new deal...it's on his very own twitter page...so why is he holding the government hostage?  oh right, because he's a coward and doesn't know how to negotiate.  he's afraid to let the bill pass onto the senates (which is republican controlled) and have them vote on it  because he's afraid to have a veto under his belt... BTW...Dan....the ones who cross the border to work....they are taxed social security....a tax they can never see as non-citizens....being that we do not have enough social security, they're contribution is helping to keep us afloat on this....use your brain and do some real research like an actual government site....or even a library
Saige Turner yeh...research the Dems bill that funds other countries. At least keep our money here!
Chuck Schumer Barack Obama Hillary Clinton Joe Biden Dianne Feinstein ALL voted to spend billions on a ‚ÄúSecure Fence‚Äù in 2006  Why are they opposed to one now!!!  ü§î

Americans want safety and security! Yes!! We also want to live and thrive!!!! Survival and poverty are unfortunately the results of a corrupt system. Change that and your name will live on forever. Make America great!
Wasnt mexico paying for the wall? That was the promise.
Do they really? How about an honest president?
Fox News (I use the term loosly) is full of bull, all surveys/polls I have seen the majority think the wall is not needed. The majority DO want border security, there are a number of options. Don't mix the two.
Mr. President, isn't there money confiscated from the drug kingpins, like El Chapo, that could be used for the construction of the wall we need so much.

I agree with the wall but not the government shutdown will have a crisis here if it's not opened back up....
The democrats aka Pelosi, Schuman most likely don‚Äôt want the Wall built, to keep the Drug Cartel and them wealthy. Remember in 2009, democrats under Obama, overturned the 1988 Ban on use of federal funds for needle-exchange program. Why do democrats want to encourage drug users to continue the deadly habits?
Secure the border, end illegal immigration once and for all.
I want border security not just a wall across our entire border. Address the real issues with the system and Congress will work with you  It is time to compromise!
the thing I want to know is why is it that the news said that more Citizens do not want the wall but I was not asked and none of my family was asked. I want the wall for the security of my family and friends. the border patrol can not stop everyone or everything from entering the us. the Democrats needs to stop being bull headed and compromise. I watched as they blamed Donald J. Trump. Stop blaming him for everything that goes wrong.
The Democrats  get on my last NERVES take it out of the pay they are not earning

They fear Gov. shutdown must be affecting their lives in some way because Democrats say it is.

Need to cut the Pay for Congressmen, Governors Everyone in Government until they Actually DO Their JOBS.  Use their pay to Build "The Wall".
Take the money from all the wasteful govt programs to pay for the wall. The illegals are flooding into Arizona where I live. Plus some how they're getting medical benefits when they shouldn't.
Pinocchio continues with the hate mongering and hate.
Please post your security plan so Americans can read it. Then we can decided if we call our elected representative s

I can see that.  And then give the guards orders to shoot to kill.
Thomas Sargent  Only shoot to kill if violence erupts , detain and run back grounds on them ones with violent record , stick in   Guantanamo Bay pending trial by a military court instead of a liberal/democrat circus court.   On November 13, 2001, President George W. Bush issued a new military order in the war against terrorism. The order called for the secretary of defense to detain non-citizens accused of international terrorism. The order specifically applies to members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. But it also includes all those who have engaged in, aided, or conspired to commit international terrorist acts against the United States or its citizens.Those who knowingly harbor such individuals are also subject to the order. Under the order, the secretary is charged with establishing military tribunals (also called military commissions) to conduct trials of non-citizens accused of terrorism either in the United States or in other parts of the world.
The democrats need to work with Trump make America great

let him build it we can always knock it down later. much later.
Put our military all around the 50 states and no one comes in and if you leave do not try to return.
They want the baby cut in half.
we need to call Pelosi (202)225-4965 and Chuck (202)224-6542 and leave a message "Build The Wall". We work hard for our money,first they didn't vote to give us the tax reduction and, the money they have of ours, they are wanting to help other countries with...we don't work so they can use our money to work against America!
They won‚Äôt to stop you all political
Greg Merz Why don't you F*ck off asshole.
They won‚Äôt to stop you all political
Put it to a physical vote I'm erican and don't want the wall. People should have the right to vote

your promise was build the wall mr gorbachev and have mexico foot the tab, the way I heard it, just sayin.
YES! Stay the course Mr. President! We are behind you!
It‚Äôs important for the Democrats to üõë you Mr. President from fulfilling your promises so that when it‚Äôs time for re-election, Democrats can through it in your face and the rest of the USA üá∫üá∏! Democrats will say, ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt keep his promises!‚Äù Those that elected you know the TRUTH and will continue to support you President Donald J. Trump!
Silent majority of U.S. citizens is for ensuring the nation‚Äôs security and security of their families. ‚ÄúNo if‚Äôs or but‚Äôs about the Wall.‚ÄùThey‚Äôll be around in 2020 to deliver the greatest political smackdown in history!
they only worry for their selves we to under educated to poor and deplorable for our safety or think for ourselves they want total control over us

Janet Williams that's what I said too and the senate. There the ones stopping this, it's not the rest of us. Get the prisoners to help build the wall, like the frigid people
Suppose to be drug people

Build the wall! We are behind you President Trump! #buildthewall
Haven't you already had 2 years to build this wall?
Thank you Mr. President for all you do for our country . Build the wall !
NO I do not want it, it is immoral and you would do better to revise the current immigration system, which by the way has allowed terrorist to fester in this country legally.
President Trump if you feel the need to declare a state of emergency to get your money to provide security for this country because the Democrats just don't like you do what you have to do.
Thank you for standing firm on this important issue.
Protect our borders build the wall Mr President!!!
Sorry about that?
Protect our borders build the wall Mr President!!!
For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.
Bill Champion ...not nice to call his base crazed...there are many people who feel the Dems are crazed...but we are all entitled to an opinion. Anyway, don‚Äôt underestimate or be short-sighted - Mexico could pay in time due to changes.  It looks like the Dems will continue to obstruct.  Amazing that the President has managed to improve the economy.  Many are thankful for the change from Obama‚Äôs NWO direction and the fact that Hillary is not POTUS.
Vickie Jarrett Cartledge I changed my sentence above from "crazed base" to "short-sighted" base. I was addressing his crazed base, the ones that "ignore" the fact Trump said multiple times that Mexico "will pay" for the border wall. He ran for President on that platform. I will wait for the President of Mexico to say they will pay for the wall. Now, as for as not nice to mention Trumps "crazed base", its interesting his base is OK with his life-long disgusting or "unflattering" comments and actions, many of those targeting women. We deserve better.
Bill Champion -respectfully, note that you chose the word I used- ‚Äúshort-sighted‚Äù...and that is def not true of those who support our President (which was the point I was making when I used the word first).  People were hugely concerned with the direction that Obama was taking our country and certain that it would get much worse with Hillary. Mexico will pay for the wall with change to the burden we see from that country if Dems will stop obstructing progress.  I don‚Äôt recall anyone saying we would negotiate with their President for a fund. I cannot fathom how people are so naive, blind, or brainwashed to not see the changes we need for U.S. security and welfare.  We must enforce law and    do what we can to keep our border from being breached.  Do we help others?  Sure...what is the best solution?  All people of the world matter...not just those who try to enter illegally.  Countries need to work to improve their standard of living..the U.S. cannot house the world.  Additionally, we have the right to guard against harm. I am amused at Trump‚Äôs character attack.  Surely, you know that the ‚Äútrained politicians‚Äù who have served are no better.  Trump was in the entertainment industry before politics...so far there is no evidence of the disgusting behavior known by Clinton, JFK, etc. while serving as POTUS. Trump is not a trained, polished politician.   Many appreciate that he is not just that smooth talking image used by a political machine.  Many appreciate the fact that he has actual knowledge, skill, and success needed to bring good change...not just a do nothing career politician.  Is he perfect..no, but he was the best choice at the time.  He has proven to be capable of leading toward good change -especially if Dems would support this country and stop obstructing progress. Those who support the Dems socialist, NWO agenda are the short-sighted and misguided base.
Vickie Jarrett Cartledge I repeated  your word ‚Äúshort-sighted‚Äù to only make you happy. No other reason‚Ä¶.I also used ‚Äúunflattering‚Äù, thinking that would be nice too. OK, so much for that. What Bill Clinton did while President has no reflection or parallel with the distress Trump has brought to our country as President of the US and ‚Äúleader of the free world‚Äú.  (Btw, I never voted for Bill Clinton and I‚Äôm still a registered Republican, which means nothing.) I vote and support who I think would make the best leader for our country.  Vickie, our allies don‚Äôt trust us anymore, that‚Äôs not leadership. Trump has eroded years of world goodwill and respect. Trump can‚Äôt manage his own administration. Four military Generals have left either by disgrace or opposition to Trumps erratic behavior and seat of the pants decisions. He flames the fire of division across our nation and the free world. He manages like a failed casino mobster. He‚Äôs a billionaire that‚Äôs filed bankruptcy 4 times, treats women and speaks of them and his sexual conquest like an immature 18 year old. Some of this and more ‚Äúbefore‚Äù anyone had the opportunity to vote for him.  Demos want border control that represent the values that most of us know and respect. Values that made our county the most admired in the world. Not a wall (I can add some adjectives but I‚Äòll be nice).  Yes, I agree that Trump never said he would negotiate with Mexico to build the wall. Trump said repeatedly that Mexico ‚Äúwill‚Äù pay for the wall. The guarantee that millions bought into and voted for him. Of course, three million more voters ‚Äúdid not‚Äù buy into his ridiculous promise.  On Feb. 16, 2016 then Mexican president Vicente Fox, flatly stated that Mexico will not pay for Trumps wall. I believed the former Mexican leader and still do.  The manufactured wall issue, which Trump ‚Äúwaited‚Äù to rally his base, is nothing more but another diversion from the Mueller investigation, which so far has placed a wall around some pretty bad hombres. And Flint still doesn‚Äôt have clean water.
Well Bill ..it appears the discourse is going nowhere.   I don‚Äôt think anyone expected for Fox to SAY that he will pay for the border wall...seems you do not get that change in interaction with the country will save the U.S. more than the price of a wall. The lifelong unflattering and or disgusting comment/behavior regarding Trump is a joke.  Do you really believe that someone with Bill Clinton‚Äôs sexual predator track record has not exhibited unflattering and disgusting comments and behavior??...and to be so disgusting WHILE SERVING as leader of our country!  The groomed politicians are somewhat smooth ...but nasty, and imo- Clinton is far worse...as other politicians are deceptive. Of course we vote and support who we feel would make the best leader (duh).. To excuse Bill Clinton‚Äôs behavior and say that it has no parallel to distress is such a blind comment of denial...along with thinking that Dems want border control that represent known and respected values is just being out of touch with the truth. Apparently you drink the koolaide...I don‚Äôt. If you cannot recognize the hypocrisy, lies, and socialist, NWO direction of the Dems...unfortunate. I think we can look at economic systems in countries and see that capitalism is far better than socialism. The Dems are not about the welfare of this country...they are about so much more..they are about their own welfare while serving the welfare and agenda of the machine behind them. Trump has faced bankruptcy..not uncommon for people who engage, don‚Äôt give up, and are successful.  The man gives his salary to charity, and I don‚Äôt want to hear garbage of how much he gives in respect to what he has.  Notably-Trump is not getting rich from politics as the career politicians are.  We need term limits so that those with political office just might possibly work for the welfare of the citizens and NOT toward a career focused on the welfare of themselves and their puppet masters.   The issues in Trump‚Äôs admin are fueled by the obstruction of said career politicians. The world issue is complex...too much to discuss. I applaud policy change with allies, and world policy in general.  A border wall with Mexico is just a small needed measure. (As far as the wall is concerned..it is needed for many good reasons, and far less money than the problem costs of our border being breached.  It will not solve the problem, but it only takes common sense to know that it will help.) Trump is shaking things up in a needed direction. The corruption is so huge and obstructionist are involved in that. Trump is not a perfect example of all that should be, but at least he has thrown a cog in the wheel of the socialist, NWO machine that the Dems deceptively serve.  Sadly, many are not aware of this threat that will ultimately result in change not good for people (to put it simply)...sadly, short-sighted and shallow thinkers. This is all I have to say...we see things differently.

For the ones who's argument is trump said Mexico will pay for the wall don't forget you can keep your doctor you can keep your coverage
Steve Demarb OK, here's your compromise and solution. Have the 1.8 million DACA aka *dreamers* pay 5k each for US Citizenship. Wall gets funded, DACA's become citizens and best part? Mexican's funded the wall! (Mic drop!)

I'll bet every Democrat has a fence around their homes, such hypocrits.
Hold your ground until it is done!
Yes, build the wall! We need it!! MAGA!!! Thank you President Trump 2020!!!!
It‚Äôs a cost vs benefit issue. Wall will be a wasteful boondoggle.
Mister president please build your wall
Shud have ashamed to promote cowardly criminal Tricky Trump
yes we want the steel wall. Do it. Do it right.
Alison Edwards Lorentz sounds good to me
Peter says the president and the other two members of Congress shall be put into a room and no one comes out until an agreement is made
So secure the border, but a wall ain't it. Stop holding America hostage for your wall, and open the govt.
Amazing how some people have decided the greatest threat to our sovereignty and safety are hungry, dehydrated, exhausted families with nothing but the clothes they are wearing. But mass shootings, domestic terrorism and Russian election interference are totally fine...
We want border security. Term limits for Congress and Senate!!!!!!! Lets go....
Everyone is for border security Crazy Donnie.   How is money to  be spent. No blank check.
I voted for you because you said you were going to take care of business.  TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS.
Easy one! They are against you even if it hurts us. They only care about how things impact them politically. They couldn‚Äôt care less about Americans.
We all know the answer to this.
Yes build the Wall build the Wall the America people are with you
No pay for Congress and continue it for the workers.
yes we want the steel wall. Do it. Do it right.
it must be nice to work for the gov , having a nice vacation.
Democrats wanted it until Trump took office.
what is sad, our government stops the wall, wanting to spend the money on donations to other countries. the money comes from the taxes. take care of us first.
Don‚Äôt give in.  Keep it closed.  Build the barrier
I would like the wall to be done . Please stop the lying and get your facts right, I am starting to think otherwise on a candidate for 2020
That right ! Stop giving are jobs to them . We would have more jobs to the people over in America that need job's . American are struggling enough . With out them coming over here and take the jobs that we need . They shot us if we came in there country !
Everyone wants border security. What they don‚Äôt want is an ineffective expensive wall just to boast your ego and one that you convinced your ‚Äúsheep‚Äù, Mexico would pay for.
Anyone remember the ‚ÄúSecure Fences Act?‚Äù  What has changed, hmmm.
Democrats are blind! Any real American cares about the security of our Country!
Just a thought! Wish he had proposed that legislature in Washington go without pay til this is decided and  return the ordinary government workers their pay. It‚Äôs them that aren‚Äôt doing their job! Bet when they lost their pay check it would be a whole different story.

During your campaign you said you were a negotiator and would work with both parties. In case you are unaware, negotiating is all about give and take. However, it is becoming clear that you are not able to work well with others and are nothing more than another politician dividing the country by political affiliation. Enough is enough with this government shut down! You are acting like a two year old who didn‚Äôt get his way. Meanwhile, there are American families who are wondering how they going to pay their bills and feed their children. Unfortunatlely, not all of us a rich like you Mr. Trump!
Amber Maki did you complain when Obama shut the government down? The president has been trying to work with the democrats and has been met with opposition from day 1. It takes two sides to work together. What you‚Äôre really saying is bend over. Their priority is only to obstruct anything and everything the president proposes. Their goal is solely his failure and to hell with America. They‚Äôve been crying impeachment for two years since Hillary lost. You‚Äôve got Congress ‚Äúwomen‚Äù blabbering about going to Washington to fight Trump and impeaching the MF. REALLY? Their ‚Äújob‚Äù is to represent the people and they are using it instead to fulfill their own personal twisted agenda. Now you tell me how that is WORKING TOGETHER!!!!
Democrats are blind! Any real American cares about the security of our Country!
Stand strong.  We support you Mr. President.
SECURITY YES WALL NO ..........AND YOUR PROMISE WAS THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY
Thank you Mr. president for bring up, Marilyn Pharis in the central coast Santa Maria, Ca.  Marilyn Pharis death was so terrible, ruthless and painful for her not the people who did this, they get 2 trials with interpreters and 25 years for taking a beautiful life from us.
Great job, Mr. President! We love and support you because you love and support all Americans. Stay strong. You are in office by the grace of God.
Stay strong President Trump!  We want border security!
You did the right thing President Trump. You had to do a state of the Union because you are in this IMMIGRATION battle alone outside of all support base that's in every state in the USA.  I'm sick of the democrats, unelected big money donors, and the media dementing & rottening minds AND destroying the fabric of this country.
Mr President: how do we the American People vote to have the Voted Officials Congressman and congresswomen receive the same Medical Benefits, OBAMA Care, for their health insurance.  They deserve to have all the benefits they voted for the rest of America.  We would not want them to miss out on the experience and the cost increases they have in storage for everyone else!
We are giving one more penny to another country till our government takes care of ours! Pelosi Schumer your time is up!
What is this BS about not pulling troops from Syria. Please dont listen to criminal war-monger John Bolton. He is a war criminal.

Perhaps the answer is to stop funding these countries and buy them so we can really improve their conditions.
Go for it president trump we‚Äôre behind you.
Don't play the blame card,Stop it.      I'm not employed,thank you.     Accept a phase in up to that amount,you expect to be re-elected right?    No concern for the bugget,nor the payments to our troops .      Demanding will not work well for you in the long run,if you want to be re-elected to see it come about.
We support you right here in Northeast Texas Mr President! God Bless!
Build four walls.  Small ones.  One on each side of you and I'll pay for it myself.
I'm watching you tonight, Mr President!
Keep working for the true Americans! Thank you Mr. President Trump
Build that damn wall, long and tall !!!
Mr. President, please show the videos of Democrats saying that a wall is needed and will work (according to Chucky) right before your speech tonight.
Time to call for national emergency!!!

Hi, Eric!
Declassify everything on the Democrooks it‚Äôs time to hang them high!
Stand strong Mr. President, we are behind you and the other snowflakes just want more votes.  Has anyone checked into Calif's laws for collecting votes yet?
Be good president. .mercy. .the money not the important thing in life
The majority do not want a wall border security yes.  You are suppose to be governing for the majority
Karen Harvey No Karen it is fact. You know just not liking facts does not change them or make them disappear, unless of course you are a trumpie.
They don't fulfill campaign promises Mr president...they don't want you fulfilling campaign promises......
1. Walls don‚Äôt work. Illegal immigrants have tunneled underneath and/or erected ramps up and down walls to simply drive over them. People find a way. When East Germany erected its wall, it created a military zone, staffed by booted, machine-gun carrying guards ready to shoot to kill. Yet thousands managed to make it to West Germany anyway. More to the point, do we really want to model ourselves after communist East Germany?  2. Most illegal immigrants are ‚Äúoverstayers.‚Äù They come to the US legally ‚Äî for vacations, business, to study, etc. ‚Äî and then STAY past their visas. By 2012, overstayers accounted for 58% (THE MAJORITY!) of all unauthorized immigrants. A wall is meaningless here!  3. Walls have little impact on drugs being brought in to the US. According to the DEA, almost all drugs come in through legal points of entry, hidden in secret containers and/or among legit goods in tractor-trailers. A wall will have little to no impact on the influx of drugs into our country.  4. It‚Äôs environmentally impractical. Walls have a hard time making it through extreme weather. For example, in 2011, a flood in Arizona washed away 40 feet of STEEL fencing. Torrential rains and raging waters do serious damage. Also, conservative sources generally do not address the environmental harm that walls create, but there is plenty of documentation available that show its potential for irreparable damage to both plant and animal life.  5. A wall would forces the U.S. government to take land from private citizens in eminent domain battles. Private citizens own much of the land slated for the wall. The costs of the government snatching private land ‚Äî and the legal battles that would ensue ‚Äî are incalculable.  6. Border patrol agents don‚Äôt like concrete or steel walls because they block surveillance capabilities. In other words, they can‚Äôt mobilize correctly to meet challenges. So in many ways, a wall makes their job more difficult.  7. Border patrol agents say, ‚ÄúWalls are meaningless without agents and technology to back them up.‚Äù Are we prepared to pour countless billions annually ‚Äî after the wall is built ‚Äî to create a nearly 2,000 mile, militarized 24-hour surveillance border operation? Because according to patrol agents, that‚Äôs the only way a wall would work. Again, are we really, going to use East Germany, a brutal communist state, as our model here?  Are we seriously going to model ourselves on East Germany and their wall? A 1979 celebration in E. Berlin. 8. Where walls have been built, there was ‚Äúno discernable impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens.‚Äù In other words, they came in elsewhere, primarily where natural barriers such as water or mountainous regions precluded a wall.  9. An unintended consequence is that a wall blocks farmworkers from EXITING when their invaluable seasonal work is done. Farmers are against the wall because it makes getting cheap seasonal labor almost impossible as few American citizens want or can even do those jobs. And if seasonal worker do get in, a wall makes it harder for them to leave! A wall traps migrant farm laborers in our country.  10. Trump‚Äôs $5 billion is a laughable drop in the bucket for what would ACTUALLY be needed. For example, according to the Cato Institute: An estimate for a border wall area that only covered 700 miles was originally 1.2 billion. How much did it REALLY cost? SEVEN BILLION. And that‚Äôs only for 700 miles. Whatever we think it‚Äôs going to cost, experience shows us we have to multiply it by more than 500%.  11. According to MIT engineers, the wall would cost $31.2 billion. Homeland Security estimates it at $22 billion. Given the pattern of spending mentioned in number 10 (plus Murphy‚Äôs Law), that means we‚Äôre really talking about pouring endless billions into something that doesn‚Äôt even work. And, of course, we taxpayers will be footing the bill, not Mexico. Given all the drawbacks, is that REALLY the best use of our taxes?  As the conservatives of the Cato Institute put it, ‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs wall would be a mammoth expenditure that would have little impact on illegal immigration.‚Äù (Emphasis mine) Also it would create many ‚Äúdirect harms:‚Äù ‚Äúthe spending, the taxes, the eminent domain abuse, and the decrease in immigrant‚Äôs freedoms of movement.‚Äù
Just assuming, most of these comments aren‚Äôt coming from those on furlough or those working and not getting paid. Please go to your bosses and tell them you won‚Äôt accept a paycheck until the shutdown has ended. Let me see how many of the base reacts after you can‚Äôt pay your bills because he can‚Äôt have a wall. Kind of like if you don‚Äôt play the football game the way I want I‚Äôll take my ball and go home. Kidsey stuff.
Why do the Congress and Senate still get paid with the govt shutdown?  Take away their pay just like everyone else and see how fast things get done.
Please president Trump help us I hope you get the money you ask for from Congress for the wall and end this government shutdowns
Thank you Mr President.  Stand your ground and please keep fighting for us.  #Trump2020
Americans want their tax refund check.... üòù

No they don‚Äôt! Only your supporters do!

Build the wall... !!!!!!!!!!! I love my country n my president!!! Go Trump!!!!!!!

Thanks Mr president build the wall!!!!!

"That is power, the mob is Rome. And while Commodus controls them he controls everything."
Rome comes not from who controls the Senate, but who controls the mob -- the mob is the people, the unruly masses of ordinary citizens.
Build the wall... !!!!!!!!!!! I love my country n my president!!! Go Trump!!!!!!!
E-Verify. Stop hiring illigals. Fine businesses who hire them. Put Americans first. Stop the feebees. And yes, how about a double wall with a solid dirt road between them so border control can do their job.
If you do not have money, use the Mexicans to build the wall. You could pay them with a green card...
Funny how the media quickly side with Democrats 100% need the wall. These families women and children can easily come over legally and get visa and go through process like all the legal immigrants from Mexico.
Border security is very important.  However, the method proposed should be questioned. One cannot successfully resolve a 21st century problem with 5th century technology(wall). One only needs to look back in history....The Maginot Wall....built by the French in the 1930s  to prevent German invasion.  We all know how that went.
Mr President, I do agree we need to secure our borders, but we need to build a smart wall not a wall like China built 2000 years ago and it was useless. Sensors, heat cameras, drones, AI, etc - not bricks... c‚Äômon!
Your promises? Stopping you? Working together? Are you fucking kidding me? It‚Äôs not about you. It‚Äôs not about your promises. It‚Äôs about common sense man. Stop this craziness.
Rome comes not from who controls the Senate, but who controls the mob -- the mob is the people, the unruly masses of ordinary citizens.
But please help me with money buddy I've been on your side the whole time
You promised Mexico would pay for the wall.
Build that wall Mr. President, thank you!
Build the wall don't give in the 25% thats shut down we haven't even missed.
This has to be one of Manford‚Äôs Russian Facebook tied Facebook pages
We need to build one like the Germans did.
We can/could have better border security.  We do not require a wall of concrete or steel.  Double ICE's budget, hire more BPA, crack down hard on illegal employment of aliens, add lawyers to challenge sanctuary cities...  My God, I could put $5b to much better use!!!
Everything must have a reason! Support our president ! Make American great again
Your promises? Stopping you? Working together? Are you fucking kidding me? It‚Äôs not about you. It‚Äôs not about your promises. It‚Äôs about common sense man. Stop this craziness.
Stay Strong!! I am an former Air Force wife and live in Texas. I want the wall. If the Dem want to drag this out, so be it. Sad, but not surprised.
Seems people do not understand the objective. The objective is to STOP people from crossing the border illegally. The objective is not catch and release like we do in sport fishing. The only electronic method that would stop illegal crossing would be drones programmed to shoot and kill. Building a wall is far more humane.
Very proud of you Mr. President stay strong
Mr, President, Why do you not cut the pay of all of Cogress and take away all the perks they receive as a member of Congress, then perhaps they will see the light !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Our family is with you Mr. Trump stand firm and keep standing up for our country we are proud to have you as our President.
Why is the wall so important? Criminals will find away to get in like dig a tunnel. Oh wait they already do that.
So now you're not taking responsibility for shutting down the government. Predictable.

The only true way forward is together. A strong future is built on the backs of many and no part in it is any less important than the other. We will get there together Mr. President!
Have you heard of things called tunnels Donald? Or, how about ladders?

I cant believe how delusional Pelosi and Schumer are, Mr President shut down the boarder completely now.

They will leave no stone unturned to eliminate you! Therefore I address to your common sense - act before they do. They do it already - we just don't see it yet, because they always act underground. We only see the dead - but we have to talk about the living. Yes, yes, all right, I understood and I know a few human lives don't matter compared to the planet. But excuse my way of thinking - for me every single creature - no matter if worm or human - is my planet and my (our) way of life! This should also be your view of our planet. Thank you. Do it!!! #wwg1wga

Brad Thompson Upchuck him in Mexico for a few days..
I am not in favor of constructing a border wall, but you aren't interested in my opinion or representing me as an American. You only seem interested in representing your "base." Weren't you elected to represent ALL the people?
Charissa Rausch I wish you could experience what we deal with in border states and perhaps understand. Additional fencing along with increased personnel and technology is needed to slow the tide. Three of my family members have personally suffered from the doings of illegals committing criminal acts. Our school is bilingual and challenged by the transient attendance. Our neighborhoods have transmitted to third world country appearance and operation. Without a slowdown, there is no way for absorption and assimilation to work. You may not feel it yet in Idaho, but it won't take long at this pace.

Mr. President, you said that Mexico would have to pay for the wall. How about we take foreign aid money from Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, etc. and fund that wall. Why do we continue to provide aid to countries who won't take care of their own people.
We need to build border wall for Americans security
Stand strong Mr President build the wall
Gonna have a lot of pissed off Americans if you keep up with shutdown, can't take foodstamps away from those who are in need of it. A lot of the American people who are on food assistance for their kids and WIC are going to be against you! This is uncalled for. And you can't expect people to work for free! #justsaying
I've toured the border with CBP agents, and you know what they first showed me? THE TUNNELS. But no, let's throw money away on a useless deterrent to non-violent people....

So easy , thousands of vehicles go across the border every day. Put a $5 or $10 charge on each time any cross the border and it will help pay for the wall.

Bullshit people are not getting paid !! That's  ur priority!!
What's more important to this president? Fulfilling an idiotic promise or doing what's best for America? If you watched him this evening, it's crystal clear. It's not about America. It's all about Donald's ego. :'(  Even the OAN commentators were choking on his lies.

He said it right there at the top: fulfilling a campaign promise which is nothing more than red meat to his base. His address tonight will be nothing more than untruths and misinformation. A manufactured crisis because right wing pundits called him out. Nothing more.

Border security yes.  Border wall no.  There is money in the House appropriation bill for border security including fencing.
Incompetent 45 doesnt care that our national security is in big jeopardy today. The TSA agent arent getting paid and are calling out sick. Our airports where most of the terrorists and drugs come through are NOT secure due to CORRUPT 45s SHUTDOWN!  Adulterous 45 is a disgrace!
More LIES from adulterous, hateful, lying, inept, dense and very CORRUPT 45. OLD 45 promised that Mexico would pay for the  WALL. Polls show Americans want border security not ridiculous WALLS.
I don't care who pays for the wall, we need it,
A wall is not a COMPLETE immigration policy  which is what we need
The republicans didnt support the dems vote on the wall, so it works both ways. And that was your promise, not theirs. If people truly supported it, the dems wouldnt have the house

Now drop the wall and negotiate increased cbp personnel, technological defenses and other effective defenses.
Cathy Bellin Drop Nancy and Crooked Chuck I'm Mexico, I bet they would negotiate like they wanted to under Pres. Obama and Pres. Clinton wanted it...

If we ask for drugs they will supply.

You have not kept your promise! You have not and collected the money from Mexico. The fact is, you and you alone are responsible for not finishing that wall. You had both houses and two years time mr. trump. The question is what stopped YOU, mr. trump, building the wall?

Mexico isn't gonna pay for his vanity project, it never was going to pay for it. Trump told a lie. Now Trump wants the US taxpayer to pay for his vanity project, and his supporters are so brain dead they aren't saying to Trump "You said on several occasions that Mexico would pay for the wall, not us!"
Good old Fox - straight from Trump's playbook....fabricated numbers, lies, twisted logic & putting false words in peoples' mouths....I expect Trump to spew Fox's rhetoric in this lie-filled article almost word for word (except pausing mid-sentence to repeat the bigger words & sniff)...what a maroon...
The odds makers are taking bets on how many times Trump will lie tonight. http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-trump-lies-gambling-speech-odds-35-bet-20190108-story.html
If Trump thinks Mexico will pay, tell him to keep up all the records of the so-called money we are getting from Mexico and when it gets to $5.8 billion, he can show Congress and get the wall built.
You tell them Trump! God bless the 45th. Our children and grandchildren will thank you. Make it big make it beautiful. #Trump2020  #BUILDTHEWALL

Missed your speech, Donnie.  I was watching your girlfriend fold her clothes on Instagram.
open the government then talk immigration. Just because Trump promised a big beautiful wall doesn't mean he gets what he wants. He constantly lies about everything
Hold The Line Pres Trump !!!!! Do not back off !!!!!
I have friends and family in prison. If walls didn't work, they'd be out causing mischief.
Ask Nancy and Chuck, why do they have walls around their homes ? If they think walls don't work then tear theirs down !

They don't care about our security, all they care about is obstruction...and that obstruction isn't just against Trump...it's against ALL OF US who voted for him!  They are NOT representing the people!  They are doing their OWN WILL, against the American people, who put Trump in office by an overwhelming majority!  The ILLEGITIMATE HOUSE we have now, by voter corruption and FRAUD will feel our wrath in 2020.
Ask Nancy and Chuck, why do they have walls around their homes ? If they think walls don't work then tear theirs down !
Yes we want the Wall built!!! Keep our country safe.
Why won't yall pay for the wall since you want the wall ? Its real simple
They gave you funding for border security, just not a wall.
Your own propaganda machine!  Fox News. Also, wanting border security is not synonymous with a wall. Ff
Wow the liberal comment never seen to amaze meü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è why are they so stupid and brainwashed? Like honestly!!
Praying for you!  Praying for America!
Stay strong President Trump. We the people are behind you!!  Build the Wall!!  Go gettem Trumpster!!
They said they risk their life to come to the greatest country in the world. They do not want to see this country turn into what they left. They say Trump loves all people not just the rich.

Working together?  Do you work together?  Right.  Why then should they work with you?  And why not just listen to the experts on how to deal with this problem rather then fixate on a political wall?  Because it's really not about the wall.  Its about the fight for the wall.  It's about politics.    Lol.

I want border security just not a worthless pointless wall. A 10 mile moat would work better anyway
Flood the tunnels too... Then work on airport security and other means of entry.  And do not forget those who have overstayed their visa.
Lori Elliott you have NO idea what you are talking about so let the adults talk run along and play
The eu is ok funding a border wall for Turkey the left aren't moaning about that
Did he just say, Democrats aren‚Äôt Americans??
No! Americans want you to get hit by a truck!
We all want border security. But only 30% want a wall. Funny thing...30%..is also the amount of Americans diagnosed with delusions.

Dems are babies!!  The politicians and the voters. They cry and whine when they don‚Äôt get their way. We raised 20million!  That means we want the wall. We want immigrants, just not illegal ones!!
If you found a cure for cancer they would oppose it.
Then tell Mitch to introduce the bill and when you get it ... sign it.  Stop being a POS con man
Lori Elliott you have NO idea what you are talking about so let the adults talk run along and play
They rather have Americans suffer  and not appear weak to stop the president from looking good to voters
The government shutdown is your fault Trump, you said you would own it. So own it! You can't pass the buck on this one!
Hey #Shit4Brains we have border security, we haven‚Äôt been invaded in almost 100 years

Build a wall on only one border. Looks to me like you don‚Äôt like the people on the other side, or why wouldn‚Äôt you build it on the Canada side too? You and your followers are motivated by the color of those on the other side of the wall you wish to build.

Well you also promised better heath care. You also promised Mexico would pay For the wall.

Trumptards are so gullable. They'll believe any bullshit Donathon tells them.
It is just not about Trump..it is against the electors of Trump they are after. The left is of one mind..Trump or someone like him is to never be elected again
President looked weak last night. When you are coming from a strong position you don‚Äôt have to justify yourself. He convinced me last night the wall is MORE worthless and pointless than it was on Monday.
Democrats are unable to think straight , because they are off the latch, since we elected President Trump. Sick of the lot of them.  But........I just love PRESIDENT TRUMP!! Keep up the Great WORK S I R!!!!!

Civilians have no concept of what freedom cost and want to whine about you or I not getting paid in reality WE WILLINGLY go without pay because it is the right thing for America first. We get our money back paid, they also do not know there are Emergency Relief funds if you get bound up and need to get money, also you sign a contract knowing you will work without pay if this happens. Americans want the freedoms United States provides as long as someone else is willing to provide them at no cost to them. They fear Gov. shutdown must be affecting their lives in some way because Democrats say it is. Well it is, they are being led astray for open boarders which is against our own countries laws to support. For one. Another it is us We the people who care for the illegals. Our money we earn for OUR Family taken from us to care for them. The more that come the more it coat and Democrats more, Open Borders. On average $18.00 a day per illegal in the country. Millions of dollars a day and more evry day and Democrats say send them on our American Citizens will pay for more and Thank US with your vote... Republicans did not want you. They wanted to put the American People FIRST. How RUDE....

Baron Von Brztekkenburg depends on who you asked!  Border patrol agents say YES to WALL
Well this article asked actual people who live on the border, deal with this made up crisis and they say No. I'll take their word over the word of someone making a living off of border security. Pretty sure the people getting paid have an alternative motive to their opinions.
Democrats will appose the wall like they opposed the Kavanaugh appointment.
The promise was that ‚ÄúMexico will pay for the wall‚Äù.
Liberals are willing to exchange American blood for Latino votes.  Simple as that.
Wish America could vote on it. But use electoral votes so all the illegals that vote for Democrats wont have as much pull.
We The People = Must take action For illegal immigration has been occurring for decades  - FINALLY  ONCE in our life time Have a President Who is  FOR We The People
Neither, getting their hands on taxpayer money is their only goal
Why doesn't a billionaire step up to the plate and build the wall for the United States and have it named after him!!!!

We need a wall/ barrier or whatever they want to call it.  Come here legally....and I don‚Äôt care who pays for it.  Think of Americans first this time
But Mexico was going to pay for it.
I think there is no point of the wall because face it we already know how to fly airplanes and dig tunnels and still have other ways yo get in the country no matter what you do
we are behind you Mr President!!!
THEY HATE YOU MORE THAN THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY
All of this is the Democrats' fault. I really wish they cared enough about the U.S. citizens to help pay for the wall that is supposed to protect us. I guess they don't care about our safety.

Stand strong Pres. Trump and don‚Äôt give in to any amnesty deal.  Reagan gave amnesty in return for a securing our border.   They got their amnesty and our borders are still wide open.  One American life lost because of an illegal, is one to many.
Mexico should pay for it! Go get the money!!!
I'm all for boarder patrol and a wall but how much of this money is coming from trumps pocket or out of the pockets of are high up political figures. I know money is being pulled out of my mother's pocket who has worked for this government for over 25 years and if she can't make her house payment that will leave her homeless how many of a government officials are looking at loosing there homes if this shutdown continues.....
Stick to your guns - BUILD THAT STEEL WALL!!!
Charles Johnson Jr it‚Äôs all lies! Stop watching the news!
We need the wall 60 years ago.
It‚Äôs obvious that it‚Äôs all about the wall...I support it, but don‚Äôt support all of us Americans you are hurting,including myself
I think the market cares more about a trade deal with China than a government shutdown.However, if the shutdown continues Trump may lose consumer and business confidence.
Thank you President Trump, Do Not give up to those trolls,  Be strong,the people with you
Dem's just want to win. They hate the President and will do anything to make him loose. They care nothing about the American people. We voted Trump in because he will fight against the establishment.
Life need to be secured first before think about something else!
I called Congress for you brother..from kalifornia..
I am not against stopping the inflow. My concern is your background as a builder and a stubborn temperament. Are their tech alternatives, sensors and drones - for that price get Musk to pop a bird up there.
I think Mr. President that once this wall goes up you should find all the homeless vets, and give them housing and a pay check and have them patrol the wall. It will bring down the rates of homeless people in America, and it will help the vets giving them a purpose.
I don't care about the wall. But if you're going to not pay someone it should be the people that are fighting, not the innocent people who have no influence on what is going on. Hold the pay on the Congress and Senate and the President until they can get along and make a compromise.!!
Stick to your guns - BUILD THAT STEEL WALL!!!
Americans want border security!
Trump you need to see this. you can fund the wall this is how. https://www.teaparty.org/chuck-norris-comes-brilliant-solution-fund-wall-youve-got-hear-340586/
oh stfu Chancy (thats Chuck and Nancy) just build the fkn wall and STFU!
It won‚Äôt matter.  Rage politics is only answer dems have.
Wouldn't it be cheaper to electrify the wall that we already have? Plus these drug dealers use boats in the Gulf & Pacific coast, as well as small planes. Plus, people that use illegal drugs will (sadly enough) just make their own.
What‚Äôs most important is for you to keep your word and get the money from Mexico like you said. You didn‚Äôt mislead your voters did you. That‚Äôs there sticking point. Don‚Äôt build a wall build a shipping canal that‚Äôll create jobs on both sides and they won‚Äôt want to come. Then build a Super-max Wall if you want. This way both country‚Äôs pay for the canal share in the overall upkeep and profits it‚Äôs a business deal a win win deal and your the master of the business world. Thanks best wishes.
I have the wall courtesy of the democrats and hilary clintons.
They will never agree ... it doesn't fit their plan. So just declare an emergency and build it. The Country will thank you when this nightmare is over.
Finally a president that is not all talk no action.

Finally a president that is not all talk no action.
President Trump: Please end the government shutdown.  I'm for better border security but does it have to be a Wall?
You can call it whatever you want. We need  border security.  The left does not care about it citizens they only want power. They can give money toward this as they waste billions on other things that is good for them
They will never agree ... it doesn't fit their plan. So just declare an emergency and build it. The Country will thank you when this nightmare is over.
Mr Trumpski, the truth is the most important thing - truth and clarity. We are talking about a man without a plan, only interested in money at any cost. A wall will not keep Americas enemies out for they sit in the Whitehouse.  Manaforte taking money from Russia, guilty of tax fraud, providing inside polling info to Russian spy, secret deals with Russian spy in Madrid on Americas stance on Russian sanctions eye- the truth is out there
KEEP IT SHUT DOWN! It hasn't affected my life one bit.
They don't want you to win! They will never give it to you and that is the only reason. They pretend the voters didn't want this. Someone send them the chants from all your rallies "Build the Wall"
UP THE RESISTANCE  STOP TRUMP AT ALL COSTS F.... the American M... F...ers
We want border security and a wall as high as you can build it. The American people own this country not Congress!
anyway is 911 war or wto war nobody want to die
This is one reason why Americans vote for you!  Build the wall.  Don‚Äôt cave to the bullies!
Withhold pay from Congress and the Senate. They are withholding pay from their constituents because they refuse to negotiate. It's time their pockets are empty. If they were under pay for performance they would wouldn't get a check. Better yet if you cant hold their pay then encourage them to donate their pay to those who are hard working individuals, doing the jobs most of them never would and now they are doing it without pay
Jeanine Pirro is the perfect Atty General

Your doing a ‚ÄúGreat Again‚Äù job pres. keep up the good work!
Just seen Dem response to address. Do I think Dems see security one way and Republicans see it another....yes. Do I think only unity can end the shutdown....yes. So, let's approve both methods....simple!
Great speech, Mr. President. You call Dems who they truly are.
Consider Compromise  yes to security
Because you Mr President said that Mexico would pay not the American tax payers  that's why.
I wounder how many people who are against the wall donate to these other countries! This should show all americans how much the Democratic elites care about them when they have walls themself. Democrats just want votes and are willing to put you at risk to get them! Wake up! Build the wall!
The question is why don't democrats want border security???? It baffles me. I know it's for the votes, but they are really willing to trade their own security for votes? Why??????
Interesting listen...  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2468045599876608&id=1102865066394675
Declared a National Emergency and build the wall to secure our boarders Mr. President.
Jeanine Pirro is the perfect Atty General
Look out,,its the nancy and chuck show, they really are out of touch,and im not even an american..
Democrats are all in on following the Luciferian agenda.
Shut down the border show Mexico we mean business
Mr. President - As a Navy veteran I know that you did not swear to protect the country when you were sworn in to office. You swore to protect & defend the Constitution of the United States just as I did when I was sworn in to the Navy. The last two years of my enlistment I was stationed at the Fleet Area Control & Surveillance Facility In Jacksonville, Florida. While there our air traffic controllers would detect planes and ships trying to evade detection, which would turn out to be bringing drugs into the country. The point being our border with Mexico is not the only way drugs and people are coming into the county illegally. what do suggest; a dome like in the Simpson Movie.
#Declassify FISA and stop the nonsense.
But you promised M√©xico would pay, and instead you‚Äôre trying to pass the cost off to taxpayers... some of whom, you‚Äôve stopped from getting paychecks at all. And the majority of us who are already struggling even with our paychecks.
Stand your ground on this it‚Äôs been needed for years!!!!!
200 year ago those socialists TRAITORS would have been hung for treason!! Let's bring that policy back üá∫üá∏
Stop giving foreign aid to our future enemies! We are in debt!
I have friends that lived near the border that must hide belongings as things were stolen from their yards.
Stop giving foreign aid to our future enemies! We are in debt!
Keep the government shut down until we fix the southern border
Federal workers on Furlough.....Do not give in.....Stand Strong Donald J. Trump Vets for Trump Why would you support someone not paying you.....hmmm.....That is because you are a true American and also served your country. Civilians have no concept of what freedom cost and want to whine about you or I not getting paid when in reality ,WE WILLINGLY go without pay because it is the right thing for the people and America first. We get our money back paid, they also do not know there are Emergency Relief funds available if you get bound up and need to get money, also when offered the job you sign a contract knowing you will work without pay if this happens. Americans want the freedoms United States provides as long as someone else is willing to provide them at no cost to them. They fear Gov. shutdown must be affecting their lives in some way because Democrats are telling them it is. Well it is, they are being led astray for open boarders, which is against our own countries laws to support. Another it is us We the people who care for the illegals. Our money , we earn for OUR Family is taken from us to care for them. The more that come into the country the more it cost and Democrats want more to come over 500,000. On average $18.00 a day per illegal in the country. Millions of dollars a day and more every day and Democrats say send them on,  our American Citizens will pay for more. Thank US the Democrat with your vote... Republicans did not want you. They wanted to put the American People FIRST. How RUDE....

You are working to hard for the American people but we love you keep up the good work
Keep the government shut down until we fix the southern border
Your promise was ....MEXICO will pay for the wall.  Not...the AMERICAN tax payers will pay for the wall.   Please be honest in your statements.   Please remember why you voted for Trump!
no matter the outcome we are on your side sir
EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT,EXCELLENT SPEECH, MR PRESIDENT!
"BUILD THE WALL"!!!!!!!  It's about time we have a president that really cares about our country and for the people. It has been a long time coming. Toooooo long! Go Mr President!!!!! Very proud to have him!!!!
When nancy said you lied just now...I turned it off.   If I happen to listen to the news I will hear her and Chuck for the next week with the same crap that I just blocked out of my life for the evening. These people are nuts and I wish they would go away.
The majority of Americans do not want a wall.  Stop with your Fear Mongering LIES
Schumer and Pelosi looked very ashamed from the meeting . Going in a meeting in a civilised world with that type of heart deserves a lot to think of. United States of America is the father of the world . Democracy in America is what other small countries are watching , Schumer and Pelosi is openly practicing hatred instead of democracy. Why hate the president .  What example are Democrats showing to the whole world about democracy.  America is bigger than individuals.  Trump is just the president for some years and Trump will finish his term and leave America as he got it. God is with America and Trump  whoever is against the citizens cause ,  will go down first. Psalms 91 .
I want to thank you for your patience sir.  Keep up the good fight.

Take the money from Congress they are not working for their fat paychecks
they already gave him 1.7 billion last year. The republican controlled senate rejected it last year. He has yet to justify 5.7 billion. And why should congress pay for it? Why should we pay for it at all? He promised Mexico would. The new NAFTA doesn‚Äôt have Mexico paying for it.... so ???? Our government isn‚Äôt working - how is that MAGA??

Build the wall please Mr president
My. President, southern cameroonians need America to stop Paul Biya from killing innocent civilians
Stay üí™ strong we are behind you on this!!!
Support and prayers for all you do Mr. President.
It's time to let the people vote on it
Or let them pay as individuals for those people. See if they want to spend money of there own

Thank you, Mr. P for standing up for the Citizen!  Give them an ultimatum; "It's either a Wall or you will cut off Healthcare and Education to the illegal, law breaking, NON Citizen"
US politics is quite puzzling to a lot of us in the UK.  I seem to remember the promise DT made was that the Mexicans would pay for a wall to be built.  Until that money has been made available, it seems undemocratic to take the money of US citizens to pay for it - there are so many good causes that need that money, ordinary people who could benefit from improvements in services.  Also, has anyone ever wondered if it‚Äôs really to keep people out?  I remember a big wall being built under those circumstances in Europe post war and it‚Äôs main function, far from keeping out the bad guys, ended up preventing so-called free people from leaving their own country, often being shot in the process.  Walls rarely create long term benefits and they mostly separate, they don‚Äôt bring people together.  Sadly, isolation policies cost much in terms of trade opportunities and standard of living in the countries that impose such ideas - even here there are short-sighted people trying to initiate debilitating isolation whilst caring nothing for how the economic costs of such plans will affect the least empowered in our society...
What a wonderful speech.  He is such a great patriot for our nation.
If Mexico pays for it. Show us the money. Better yet show us your plan.
We do NOT need this wall, I am a hard working citizen and want to go out clubbing on the weekends without having my price of cocaine upcharged 200%! The only compromise I would be willing to make is if we could open cocaine dispensaries!
Funny how new trade deal with Mexico will pay for the barrier indirectly. So Trump did figure out a way to get Mexico to pay for the barrier. Smart move . Dems can't keep up .
Thought Mexico was going to pay for it. What am I missing here? #MANGA
Mr President  Please do what ever it takes to build this wall. May god bless you and help you.

Mr President  Please do what ever it takes to build this wall. May god bless you and help you.
Dear Mr. President, since you, the senate, and the house of representatives have chosen not to work with each other I suppose that none of you  been denied you salaries in regard to the shutdown...what a surprise.  Does that mean I don't owe taxes for the weeks or months that this shutdown is in effect?  Afterall if I'm not receiving services why should I pay for it?
Are you so clueless that you are not aware Trump refused to accept the $400,000 presidential salary Obama got? His salary is $1 per year to comply with the Constitution.
Thought Mexico was going to pay for it. What am I missing here? #MANGA
President Trump stand  firm  and  build  the  wall.
Damn those airplanes ‚úàÔ∏è and boats üö£  got past my 5.5 billion dollar üíµ wall again   Damn !   now what  !!
Build the wall Mr. President,we are behind you 100%, best president ever, I pray for you everyday.
Since the democrats have caused the government shutdown let them pay the wages for all the employees not receiving a paycheck because of their drama! Schumer and Pelosi should be the first to make payments out of their own non earned wages!!!
Why don‚Äôt you just lie to the American people a few more times. Mexico will pay for the wall. What a joke this clown is.
Start a fund raising for Protecting our USA from those who believe otherwise.And use as tax right off also its for a good cause
"Mexico will pay for the wall." --Donald Trump
Are you so clueless that you are not aware Trump refused to accept the $400,000 presidential salary Obama got? His salary is $1 per year to comply with the Constitution.
Yes!! We need that wall immediately, but must have doors in case if we need them for any reason.
Great job mr. President. Build the wall do whatever you have to do
I know you're a billionaire Trump, just use your own money to build the wall, problem solve!
If everyone in America  pays 17.00 we have  5.5 billing to build a wall
I think the initiative should be taken further than just a fence.
Donald Trump for Prison 2020
While trump wants to build a wall the enemy are already in the Whitehouse, Russia straight in the front door with arms wide open.
Just shutdown the border I guarantee you the Mexican government will build that wall in record time
Martial Law , Build the Wall !
"Mexico will pay for the wall." --Donald Trump
We want to hear from the President, not the news channels.
Build the wall mr president we stand behind you.
Mr. President , you know the way around it. Do what needs to be done for U.S.. BUILD THE WALL!!!!!
While we are at it deport every single illegal that voted in our elections, charge every single American that processed all their write in ballots as votes.................Michael
Great job sir. Proud to call you my Present. We need a wall. Please keep fighting for us.
The most important thing to democrats is using their buzzword tantrums in place of real arguments to control people through mob rule. Nothing new happening with them. Stay on strike all year long if you need to and include cuts to the DNC paychecks to pay actual employees that deserve it. :)
Fact: Illegal border apprehensions are at a 46 year low. Fact: 0 terrorists have been found crossing our southern border. Does this sound like a "crisis" worth harming 800,000 Americans over? Get your facts from reputable sources, rather than this ass-clown president!
Whem Pres Trump says 4000 undocumented illegals crossed over the southern border, the ICE stats suggest he is right!  ICE says ‚Ä¢  Over a 10-year period (2005-2014) ICE arrested approximately 4,000 MS-13 members, leaders, and associates. This represents about 13 percent of all gang members they arrested nationwide (31,000) during that period.  ‚Ä¢  92 percent of the MS-13 affiliated aliens arrested were illegal aliens.
Keep up the amazing work mr . President .god bless
Stop breaking the law protect our country like you said you would when you took the oath

Dear President Trump, I am an American citizen. I uphold the Constitution of the United States of America without reservation. I am one taxpayer of We The People. I call upon the President to make a formal Constitutional declaration of National Emergency to build a necessary, suitable, and secure physical wall across the landmass and length of the southern border of the United States of America, without delay by any and all means afforded the Office of the President and the Executive branch of government. We have a National Emergency. Build the Wall. Thank you.......Karen Hudnall
Nick Demico and so they can use that against him in the election saying see he didn't get the wall built
We the will people will Prevail one way or another we will get our Wall or just piss off the demonrats by having Trump win re-election in 2020 or my personal favorite having them both.  Trump 2020-2024.

Amy Miller you are making this up. I am from a military family and we are heartsick over how this draft dodger has ruined this country and now causing hardship to ours.
Ruined our country how? The  Unemployment rate is at a all time low, he has opened up more jobs, even food stamps and government assistance is at a low. He has been doing his best, to do everything he said he would.

Rodriguez---Thank you & God Bless you & your wife.
The liberals want the illegals to come here for one reason, In my opinion; they are far more intellectually superior than a person who has less than a fifth grade education. So if you can give them the basic necessities of life, food; clothes; shelter; healthcare; ect... They will get a vote that will secure their power. Liberals want control; they demand it. Nothing will ever change it. Narcissism in the form of charity; empathy; and pulling emotional heart strings is how they play the game.
anyone?????

Thats a good question
Sorry but you sound like a parrot.

Thats a good question
The democrats are getting more anti American by the day
Maybe if Democrats weren't taking bribe money from the Mexican cartels this wouldn't be an issue. Can't see another reason why Pelosi, Schumer, Obama, Clinton, etc would flip-flop on building a barrier.
Ted Cruiz said use money seized from El Chapo drug cartel.. $14 billion.. just like local police use confiscated drug money to fight the drug problem.
That's what the people put you in office for. When you consider the overall budget, the cost for the barrier is marginal. Having proper ports of entry encourages legal migration, or requests for asylum. WY encourage illegal migration and put law enforcement in jeopardy. The Democrats act like children. Mr Trumps mandate is to lead and protect the country. This is something Fems should support. It's such another instrument to control migration.
UM YOUR PROMISE WAS THAT MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY NOT AMERICANS
Democrats want to secure the border - Trump wants a glass beads curtain made of steel. #MAGGI

The majority of Americans know a wall is not the answer.
If AGT and the Voice can have people from all of U.S. vote on contestants and have results in a real short time, why can‚Äôt you propose this on a vote of the American people to see what the majority of the people want? For the wall. Against the wall. Both parties abide by the results being that you all work for the American people! Just saying.
Do your bone spurs stop you from grabbing them by the pussy?
The people that elected him are ignorant.
The border is fine no crisis, you are fear mongering again and you need to stop.

The reason they're against President Trump is because they don't want the American public getting used to a president keeping the promises he was elected for. It's just that simple! What's going to happen when the Democrats vote in one of their own and none of the campaign promises are kept...lol

Most US citizens want more border patrol agents, going after companies that profit from the illegals, and not a wall that won't work.
Gregory James Montgomery same old brain dead crap from Liberal morons Republicans have given amnesty to illegals six times since 1986 and every time lying lowlife liberals promised to secure the border now here we are 30 years later and the lowlife Liberals are still telling the same fucking lies playing the same fucking games without Southern border

So we go from Mexico paying for the wall to 800k employees not being paid for weeks? Stop getting your orders from fox and friends and fix this man.
The answer is obviously obvious, and sad.  These people called Congress are at the core of Our Country, and are collecting great paychecks and benefits from our taxes, SO well taken-care of, but SO many of them won't even do their jobs and uphold The Law, so many of them are just plain un-American--all on Our dime.
Good speech Mr President! üëç  You are doing the right thing and what we expect from you, our leader.  Now get the job done and implement the National Emergency procedure!  The Dems response was pathetic, only hoping the opportunity will pass if you cave in to their stupid demands, so that they can continue with the status quo.  Stick to your guns Sir!   We are with you and support you all the way!  God bless you! üôè
Mexico paying for a wall?  You bombed on that one, big guy.  A wall is not a magic solution for border security in the south. What about  the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans? What about Canada?
They will try and stop you atLl cost because they don‚Äôt want American people to like you. The Democrats act like in-mature children
Gregory James Montgomery same old brain dead crap from Liberal morons Republicans have given amnesty to illegals six times since 1986 and every time lying lowlife liberals promised to secure the border now here we are 30 years later and the lowlife Liberals are still telling the same fucking lies playing the same fucking games without Southern border
They will try and stop you atLl cost because they don‚Äôt want American people to like you. The Democrats act like in-mature children
Kathyleen Sherrod Nice try. It's over for Trump.
Tim Baldwin I'm sure the whole world has awaited your pronouncement. Mr. Nobody.
Stand firm President Trump!
Tim Baldwin I'm sure the whole world has awaited your pronouncement. Mr. Nobody.
The number of white ppl who make derogatory comments proves my point.  Especially the coward who try to laugh but have nothing to say...because THEY ARE WHITE and the only ppl they know who support this president.
Kathyleen Sherrod Nice try. It's over for Trump.
Don't make promises Mr.Trump that you cannot keep. Secure the border, work on good domestic and foreign relationships. You said mexico was going to pay for the wall, work with mexico you can work it out. Are you able to work well with mexico, central and south america and other nations? There is always a way to do things and it is not impossible to work things out. Be a nation builder, people do change you know, you can change other nations as well. Its how you are willing to relate and work things out with others. Don't make any promises that you cannot keep, it makes you untruthful and someone that cannot be trusted.  Undivide the house, the senate, and make it equal with both sides working together not just one against another. Be of one mind with same vision that sees the best outcome of what is best for the people and other nations. Rewrite, and update the constitution if it is possible it is old, it needs to be revised and up to date. Be a good leader and lead the people to prosperity Mr.Trump.
Is that what Democrats want us to hate them for what they are?
Do it, whatever it takes.Deep inside the libtards  feels the need of BORDER WALL but since they HATE PRES. TRUMP SO MUCH ,THEY DENIED IT NOW.  HYPOCRITES !!!

And I  glad people aren't making their money.  I am glad the social security, welfare checks and all are coming to a screeching halt.  I look forward to the rioting in the streets because the newly elected Congress would rather support illegals than do their damn jobs.
We all know what you said but you can still change your mind big deal so what! If its better for the people why not? We dont need it. Its a waste of money time efforts and all sorts of necessary peoples talents and disposition towards aspects of you your administration and our country

You need to start your own news Network.. Trump news network! Then give it to us straight once a week! Put these pos news out of business!
Kevin Cramer there already is one, it's called TASS
Lots of people are going without pay because of YOU!!!!!! Not the Democrats; Not the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, or Cupid. It's on YOU!!!! Stop the bullshit, you horrible waste of space.
It's a false sense of security they are going to keep coming through the air ports.
Great Speech Mr President Let's Secure the Border FIRST and then End the Government Shutdown last. Hows that Nancy Pelosi and Chucky Boy Schumer NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND! :) Stay Firm Mr President
Putting criminals behind bars, that would include you. Now sit back as the mass of foriegn tRump bot comment away
I thought you said Mexico would pay for the Wall Don? So why are you asking Congress to pay for it?
Democrats are playing a childish game that will eventually bite us!
I admire Trump if there is no Trump as the president of the US right now to against China . US may be sinking into the water by China in the next 5 years. So we must vote for Trump and let him do the right way and the right time .

Trump Vets for Trump Why would you support someone not paying you.....hmmm.....That is because you are a true American and also served your country. Civilians have no concept of what freedom cost and want to whine about you or I not getting paid when in reality ,WE WILLINGLY go without pay because it is the right thing for the people and America first. We get our money back paid, they also do not know there are Emergency Relief funds available if you get bound up and need to get money, also when offered the job you sign a contract knowing you will work without pay if this happens. Americans want the freedoms United States provides as long as someone else is willing to provide them at no cost to them. They fear Gov. shutdown must be affecting their lives in some way because Democrats are telling them it is. Well it is, they are being led astray for open boarders, which is against our own countries laws to support. Another it is us We the people who care for the illegals. Our money , we earn for OUR Family is taken from us to care for them. The more that come into the country the more it cost and Democrats want more to come over 500,000. On average $18.00 a day per illegal in the country. In fact, illegal immigration costs taxpayers a staggering $134.9 billion a year while contributing only $19 billion in state, federal, and local taxes. At the federal level, medical costs make up the lion‚Äôs share of government expenditures on illegal immigrants, while education is the largest single expense that illegal immigration imposes on state and local governments. Sadly, an overloaded welfare state is not the only negative side-effect of our broken immigration system. Communities across America are also being devastated by the violent crime and drug trafficking that result from our failure to control the border ‚Äî an issue Donald Trump has addressed repeatedly and emphatically ever since he first announced his candidacy for president.Millions of dollars a day and more every day and Democrats say send them on, our American Citizens will pay for more. Thank US the Democrat with your vote... Republicans did not want you. They wanted to put the American People FIRST. How RUDE...

AMAN...THANKFUL WE AMERICANS F I N A L L Y HAVE SOMEONE LOOKING OUT FOR AMERICA...ADMIRE YOUR BACKBONE !!  KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT !!! The American people should be able to see it all..like tonight...both sides...they look like hand holding idots !!!  The TRUTH always come to light !!!
NANNN this is a tactic to stop the speaneas ...to stop investigations....because you knew that with the amont that you asked for the game of throne wall.....THEY WILL SAY NO....so .what you do...you use your troll followers with your WALL..SHUTDOWN THE GOV....ALL THIS FOR STOPING OR DELAYING THE INVESTIGATIONS......JUST A SMOKE SCREEN.....YOULL DRAG THIS SHUTDOWN FOR 2 MORE YEARS IF YOU CAN....WHY DID YOU SAY ...YEARS....HUMMMM .....BIZARRE

The most important thing to those idiots are stopping your promises no matter what the cost is.  Funny thing is Bush sr,good old Billy boy Clinton, Bush Jr, that loser Obuma , Killary Clinton all wanted the wall at least that‚Äôs what they said when they were running and trying to get the presidency

Congressional Democrats DEMAND Central America's NORTHERN-TRIANGLE'S WARFARE (The Worst Warfare On Earth) BY GANGS ON HUMANITY to  continue to increase in the USA for the Democrat's USA COMMUNIST POLICE STATE.

Shut down the IRS and stop taxing our paychecks!! That‚Äôll show them!!!
You are right, President Trump!
If during tonight's speech President Trump would make a graph of a circled colored in 100% to show the entire federal budget - and then tape a toothpick on the circle to indicate how much is needed to build the wall- the left would  be able to visualize what a tiny amount is needed for the wall!!   The left is dim and they need to see the "crumbs" it will cost to preserve and protect this nation.  It is the president's job - was in the oath he swore when inaugurated!!! And he intends to build it!  Thank you Mr President! üá∫üá∏
Build the wall!  Don't have!  Congressmen should not be paid during a shut down.  They don't feel the pinch to negotiate.
But you said MEXICO was going to pay for the wall. Was that another lie? Don‚Äôt give in Nancy make him get the money from mexico
You said Mexico was paying for the wall! If that's the case, why are you extorting us and demanding that we pay for it #DontheCon??

You can not find it.you choices impasse

Republicans have given amnesty to illegal aliens six times since 1986 with the Assurance from the lying liberal Democrats that they would secure the Border now here we are over 30 years later and the lying liberals have not only failed to secure the Border but they are continuing with the same lies that they've been telling for 30 years secure the southern border once and for all I'm 57 years old I've been waiting for this to happen since I was 19 and here we are watching The Lying liberals play the same game over and over again with our Southern border they do not care about the security of our country or the security of the American people the lying liberal Democrats will continue to play this game for another 30 years if we let them.
It is not clear that a house without an external fence to protect the security of your borders is my friend Trump
What a sad and pathetic bomb of a speech last night. Ratings were terrible. Reviews were worse. SAD. #wompwomp
Don‚Äôt give up. Stand your ground Mr. President.

The numbers show a border wall.is not wanted by a majority of Americans. Why does Fox Noise keep spreading this lie when Trump's own handpicked government officials don't even back him up because their own statistics prove he is not being truthful!
Charlene Dickerson incorrect. This is why we voted for him
Jo Anne Howell Sitterson A majority didn't vote for him. Only 34% want a wall, which makes sense because that figure pretty much matches his base.
Charlene Dickerson incorrect again.
Jo Anne Howell Sitterson You have every right to believe what you want to, as I do too.
Build the wall, Sir!!
What's more important to you? It seems that you only care about yourself and building some monument to yourself...
You are using Fake News networks to get out your message.  You are a traitor to your base.
I have a Third Option - Get The Funding Secured and Declare The Emergency So The Border Could be Secured in Months instead of Years. We have More Pressing Issues to Work On. Remember All This Construction Creates USA Jobs.
President Trump please just stop begging them, rule over them w an executive  power!!!
Jo Anne Howell Sitterson You have every right to believe what you want to, as I do too.
It's TIME!  Time to go ALL IN!
Mr President thank you so much for standing in the face of such evil people such as shumer and pelosi. Thank you for caring enough for the very ones coming against you to ensure their safety as well as those who stand with you. Please Mr. President declare the emergency and build that wall. I work everyday right next to a building housing illegal immagrants for ICE. They are bringing them in by the bus loads. These illegal immagrants are draining the tax payers ability to ever get ahead. If pelosi or any of the other evil ones want to fund them then lets drain their pocketbooks not the average american ctizen.

Your ego driven border wall is a waste of money and most Americans (including some Republicans) knows it. You used last night's address to collect campaign contributions from your supporters in the guise of a "border wall fund" when the funds went directly to your re-election campaign. I hope there is a campaign violation related to this and possibly fraud charges.

To the dems, stopping you is more important than all Americans put together.  They are totally EVIL.  God bless you President Donald J. Trump.

You hit the nail right on the head Mr. President.
They will do everything in their power not to help you as they know you will get voted in next year they are just out for themselves just like all the MPs in the UK they don‚Äôt give a flying toss about American people and keeping them safe
Trump Inks Executive Order Immediately Halting All Welfare, Unearned Entitlements and Subsidy Payments For 2019 -Illegal Immigration Ceases Instantly.
Republicans dominated for the past two years. Why are you now blaming democrats, that took over the House as of this year, for stalling the building of the wall? Not that it matters, because the wall isn't going to help. There are ways of getting around it. In all honesty, I think you're just doing what every other politician likes to do, blame the opposing party for the delays/screw ups.  Just about every single one of you are a failure.
BUILD THE WALL.   Don't give!!
It would. Americans are sick of the illegals, sick of the corruption, sick of seeing our war veterans treated like crap, sick of Obamacare, sick of the deception and lies of the Democrats, and if Congress doesn't want to do their job, then fire them and we'll handle it ourselves with our President
Yep Keep Building The Wall
Democrats and Republicans have passed funding for border security. You want only your nonsensical campaign promise version. And today, you Tweet that you never meant for Mexico to literally pay for it? You are a very bad joke. Not laughing.
Dump. Ass

I take it you don't understand a marginal tax rate. That's okay a lot of people don't.
Anne Tourjee to ask any person to pay 70% for their success is wrong. I get it. You're ok giving South   America 10.6 billion?

A minimum of about 350 million guns, and far more than 25 trillion rounds of ammo.   It may be far more.    And the  vast majority of the soldiers and police will stand with us.   They still stand up to their oaths.

and, Americans DON'T want an expansive border wall.  but when the POTUS chooses his favorite approval poll (Rassmusen at the time) and lies about 1% point (49% approval NOT 50%) in order to convince people he's doing great, is it any wonder that we believe that ~4,000 terrorist aliens were apprehended at the southern border when the number was ACTUALLY 6?
next he'll suggest a northern border wall because 41 were apprehended there (more than 6).  and you guessed it, next it will be a giant dome encompassing the entire US.
meanwhile, climate change, election security, record National debt, the opioid epidemic, North Korea, Russia, Iran, disappearing middle-class, crumbling infrastructure, healtcare costs, etc.  just aren't as important as this wall idea.  abFUCKINGsurd.

üö©Here is a statement from  üá∫üá∏JASON ROBINSON, a veteran üá∫üá∏(not me)... (copied).  "My wife is gonna be pissed that I put my dirty laundry out on FB... And I hope every single person on my feed reads this and many share it. You want to know why I‚Äôm pissed about the borders and the ‚ÄúMigrant Caravan‚Äù? I‚Äôm a 90% disabled combat vet, medically retired, like thousands of others. I‚Äôve been out of work over a year, and with the amount of VA appointments, and the amount of time per appointment, who the hell would hire me? I barely pay my mortgage and bills, I juggle repo on my vehicles and termination on utilities monthly, and we eat, ramen and cereal on a regular basis. We shop at Goodwill and frequent PawnShops not only to shop but to get loans to pay bills or maybe get something we need from time to time. Social Security won‚Äôt approve me, and State and Federal assistance programs say I am above their ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù levels, so they won‚Äôt help me. Yet some of you think it‚Äôs ok to allow migrants with nothing to offer our Nation a free pass into this country and you cannot tell me that it won‚Äôt cost the tax payer anything. I barely get approved for free lunches for my girls at school and the taxes in Virginia I cant afford to pay, and again, you want to allow these migrants to just walk in...and you want me to offer open arms?  How about you take care of us? All of us? I‚Äôm not the only one. There are many way worse than me. There are homeless. There are sick. There are hungry. In this nation. That have paid their dues. Born here. Raised here. Paid taxes here. Worked here, served here. Take care of them.  It‚Äôs time to close the revolving door of free and take care of Americans first.  Think about that crap for a second."

One of your promises was that Mexico will pay for the wall now theres a shutdown cus they arent paying for the wall cus you want is to pay for it now so thats already a promise unfulfilled and im a Trump supporter but this is getting ridiculous
I want border security
Jason Parkerson they will pay later. It's just a loan. Time to close the border.
Mr. President do NOT cave to the crazy American people hating foreigner loving Democrats. Call a national emergency and build the wall. Or use whatever funds are available for a border barricade and dig a 40ft deep X 40 ft wide trench lined with barbed wire on the Mexican side of the border. Also close the entire souther border. If the Republican Party caves to the dimms. Don't sign any funding packages without funding for the wall. Republicans will never win another election if you don't declare a national emergency and build the wall.

Racists want security
Federal workers on Furlough.....Do not give in.....Stand Strong Donald J. Trump Vets for Trump Why would you support someone not paying you.....hmmm.....That is because you are a true American and also served your country. Civilians have no concept of what freedom cost and want to whine about you or I not getting paid when in reality ,WE WILLINGLY go without pay because it is the right thing for the people and America first. We get our money back paid, they also do not know there are Emergency Relief funds available if you get bound up and need to get money, also when offered the job you sign a contract knowing you will work without pay if this happens. Americans want the freedoms United States provides as long as someone else is willing to provide them at no cost to them. They fear Gov. shutdown must be affecting their lives in some way because Democrats are telling them it is. Well it is, they are being led astray for open boarders, which is against our own countries laws to support. Another it is us We the people who care for the illegals. Our money , we earn for OUR Family is taken from us to care for them. The more that come into the country the more it cost and Democrats want more to come over 500,000. On average $18.00 a day per illegal in the country. In fact, illegal immigration costs taxpayers a staggering $134.9 billion a year while contributing only $19 billion in state, federal, and local taxes. At the federal level, medical costs make up the lion‚Äôs share of government expenditures on illegal immigrants, while education is the largest single expense that illegal immigration imposes on state and local governments. Sadly, an overloaded welfare state is not the only negative side-effect of our broken immigration system. Communities across America are also being devastated by the violent crime and drug trafficking that result from our failure to control the border ‚Äî an issue Donald Trump has addressed repeatedly and emphatically ever since he first announced his candidacy for president.Millions of dollars a day and more every day and Democrats say send them on, our American Citizens will pay for more. Thank US the Democrat with your vote... Republicans did not want you. They wanted to put the American People FIRST. How RUDE...

Donald J. Trump  #KAG  "The shutdown sent Republican poll ratings plunging, cost the government billions of dollars and damaged the nation‚Äôs international credibility. Mr. Obama refused to compromise, leaving Republican leaders to beg him to talk, and to fulminate when he refused. For all that, Republicans got a slight tightening of income verification rules for Americans accessing new health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act."  https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/congress-budget-debate.html
Press on Mr. Trump!
WALL, WALL, WALL
Yes !! Wall wall wall wall wall
Americans want secure borders but our borders are extensive. Southern, northern, airports and ports. A wall on the southern border is ineffective. Increase border security at all points of entry. People and technology. Stop your silly tantrum and reopen our government
YES, WE DO Uncle Donald J. Trump! Trump True...
As old Hank would say if you don't like our Donald Trump Is Our President you can kiss our üê¥.

WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO THOSE DEMOCRATS IS STOPPING YOU FROM FULFILLING ONE OF YOUR PROMISES PRESIDENT TRUMP!! THAT'S WHAT YOUR HATERS ARE DOING!! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT BUILDING NO WALL!! THEY JUST HATE YOU FOR TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR AMERICA!! THAT'S IT!! THEY DON'T LIKE THAT NOR DO THEY LIKE YOU!!

Just because it was a campaign promise doesn't mean it is a good thing to do. If a Democrat promised Medicare for all, do you think Republicans would say "well, it was a campaign promise so let's do it."?

As it is writing dont paytronize a influence al person .
Wasn't your promise NO AMERICAN TAXPAYER MONEY WILL GO TO PAY FOR THE WALL, I GUARANTEE IT? How come you can't manage to keep THAT "promise"? Maybe if your administration would stop constantly lying to the American People, they would be more likely to support you..... just a thought, it's obvious you simply are not capable of telling the truth, even when it's pathetically simple to disprove your bullshit.
Oh please get over yourself. If you cared anything about the people you would get over your tantrum and stop your shutdown.
There have been multiple bipartisan solutions to border security that the executive branch torpedoed. #mostcorruptadministrationever
DO NOT CAVE TO THOSE TWO LOW LIFES, PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUILD THAT WALL, I FOR ONE ARE 100% BEHIND SECURING OUR BORDER FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS !! IF THE TWO OF THEM PELOSI AND SCHUMER WANT TO ACT LIKE TWO BRATS PUT THEM INTO TIME OUT...
When Las Vegas is taking bets anf placing odds on how many times a President is expected to lie during a national address....thats a crisis... Resign...and we might go easy on you regarding russia...
Most of us are behind you President Donald J. Trump SECURE THAT SOUTHERN BORDER!!!!!
The power belongs to the people of the United States not the F***k democratic.
2 years holding the House of Representatives, Senate, White House and you wait until after the midterms to hold your tantrum.   Remember what you said about shutdowns in 2013?
President Trump is right!!! Democrats better realize the American people elected them to do their jobs if they don't do it that should be fired!

This isn't just about the wall, it's a statement to Congress to work together on border security, immigration reform and upholding our laws by stopping sanctuary city protections. They have kicked the bucket too long and our social benefit systems are being robbed - which includes aid to vets, elderly, children, Medicaid/Medicare, social security. Not to mention the disease not treated and unvaccinated people that is causing uprisings in eradicated illnesses and diseases we had not seen, like this cold started polio. That's what this is about! Be a voice with us in telling Congress to do their jobs. If you can't donate even one dollar, sign the petition at wefundthewall . com! Thank you for caring about America's ability to sustain and help others, the right way! Please share.
#PROUDOFOURPRESIDENTTRUMP!   KEEP AMERICANS SAFE...NATIONAL SECURITY IS A GOOD THING. BUILD THE WALL PRESIDENT TRUMP!  WE ARE BEHIND YOU ALL THE WAY
People overwhelmingly want security but don't let the poll numbers fool you about who thinks a wall is unnecessary or necessary.. With the leftist news outlets brainwashing folks that walls don't work, is it any wonder some buy into that drivel. If those folks were on the border with our border agents, they'd change their minds fast! Walls/barriers work and if they didn't then why put them around prisons, around our military bases, around airport runways and hangers, around electrical transformers and gee, seems under Obama they felt the fence around the White House needed to be taller, Walls, fences or barriers of some kind absolutely work!
President Trump, the demorats continue to buck every change because they are cry babies, BUT what they forget is that YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT and you have researched the best way to secure the borders with the border patrol and they have called for, begged for the 'WALL', unfortunately you have a bigger wall of cry babies in the democrat party that can't get past you being elected.    PRESIDENT TRUMP WE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU AND THE WALL.   WE ARE BEHIND YOU AND ON THE SIDE OF YOU ALL THE WAY!!!!!   GO AHEAD AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!!!!!!
HERE IS HOW YOU CAN GET YOUR BORDER WALL UP QUICKLY.  https://www.facebook.com/100014708914788/posts/538492803317679/
DUMBOCRATS DO NOT WANT SECURE BORDERS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE VOTING BASE OF ILLEGALS THEY ALLOW TO VOTE WOULD DWINDLE DOWN TO NOTHING! ITS THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL WIN THE ELECTION! üôÑüò°üí©üôÑüò°üí©üò°üí©
AND SO DO THE PEOPLE.MAYBE WE NEED TO RALLY!!!SO WE THE  PEOPLE CAN ALL SHOW WE WANT THE WALL. AND WE WANT IT  NOW!!!!
NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL , NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL, NO WALL.
The majority of Trump's base are white people on food stamps. And if the shutdown shuts that down will they love him then? They don't think about that because they can't think to begin with.
You are so clueless you don't understand how government works....53 Republicans control the Senate but they need 7 Democrats to vote yes...it takes 60 votes to pass a bill to fund government and a wall.
PRESIDENT TRUMP, PLEASE CONSIDER HANDING OUT PINK SLIPS TO REDUCE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES THAT ARE NOT NEEDED. WE HAVE WAY TOO MANY THAT WANT TO SIT ON THEIR @$$$$ES & NOT GET WORK DONE ON TIME OR NOT AT ALL. TOO MUCH INCOMPETENCE AND NOT WORTH THE PAY.  THEY CAN STOP BITCHING AND GET A NON-GOVERNMENT JOB.
I WANT BORDER SECURITY. BUILD THE WALL. WHO CARES WHO GETS A PAYCHECK OR NOT. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE WALL.
I Agree With Yu USA/American President Donald J. Trump That the Border Wall Must Be Built As I Say Don't Be Intimidated By Democrats Especially House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi as I Say The Republicans Have a Majority in Senate So Build the Wall and Show Democrats Yu Fulfill Yur Promises As I Say God Bless Yu President Donald Trump Very Much.
NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE ON MY KNEES EVERY NIGHT PRAYING FOR MY COUNTRY AS MUCH AS I HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!! YES AMERICA NOT RUSSIA. AMERICA NOT THE PERSON IN THE WH. I PRAY OUR CONSTITUTION HOLDS. I PRAY THE FEW FREEDOMS WE HAVE LEFT REMAIN INTACT!! GOD BLESS AMERICAN MY HOME SWEET HOME!!

The majority voted for Trump, the majority voted for the wall. Pelosi and Schumer have flipped flopped on this issue over the years and ignored the problem to the point that it‚Äôs totally out of control. Mexico will pay for it one way or another regardless.
But you promised the Mexicans would pay for your wall..hold them to it!
Mr. President just do the job that we elected you to do. Secure our borders! Quit sending an olive branch out to the Democrats. Quit asking them to come across the aisle and work together to better the country. we all know the Democrats are not about to do that. They are only about hate and resistance.

UP TRUMP 2020
Border security all the way
Janice Rose so you are happy that actual border security is going unpaid right now?
They are not going unpaid the military is being paid the house is being payed the Congress is being paid. If it was another president that wants this it would be passed with no problem. But the selfish people who want to control our rights and doesn't care about the American people will stop it. What happened to supporting your president what happened to America sticking together the problem is everyone wants to blame the president for everything that is wrong in this country they need to look back on the pervious president and see what they did wrong. The way I see it is this is the only president that all you people out there are criticizen on. It seems like no matter what the problem is it's the president falt when are the people going to Stat take blame for their own actions. The only thing the president is trying to do is make our country safe again, get the drugs the murders and the human trafficking out of our country. I believe in our president and will support our president and I think more people should stand up. Instead of all the hate this country has they should come together to make our country great again.
Yes we doüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

Hold Fast on the Wall! God is with you! Save America!
The Democrats have branded you as a bully and will resist  your administration until you are no longer President. I am a proud American and support you. Common sense doesn't exists in Congress.
He‚Äôs over-reacting and has fabricated a lot we‚Äôve heard and has it occurred to you that God may have directed them to the border, something God does, and our nation‚Äôs humanity is being tested?

We are with you President Trump don't let these liberals stop you. The constitution says the President is responsible for security of our boarders.
Americans want a Wall, and put the dems. om the other side of it, while you are at it.
Very true President how ever if the retarded Republicans would stop being so nieve an just decriminalize cannabis in the bill they proposed. The dems would be back at the table. 33 percent of that tax revenue from the decriminalization of cannabis would go to the wall. If your using all 50 states as an example that 33 percent would build the wall an still have some left over. I dont have a party choice however I recognize how corrupt an evil all parties are
Since it's our border. Take the money they ve given to you already, open the government the get a go fund me page so the whole Americans will contribute to it. I have 50 dollars for it already. We all need a secured home let alone a country.
What's the crisis? Tens of thousands of people coming into our country illegally every year.  Why is Trump declaring it a crisis now?  Because Democrats and Republicans FAIL to secure the border.  Both parties failed to do what was needed for DECADES.
We want security where it needs to be, not funding a self made crisis and ego stroke.   I‚Äôm looking forward to the hilarity of your circus show tonight. Remember to get out of your seats folks and actually researching the numbers since the potus has a history of lying. #TrumpsFakeNews #TemperTantrumTrump #DumpTrump #TheTrumpShutdown

No matter your political standing you must love and protect your country.  Just hating 1 man is not a good answer, grow up.

Yes, most Americans are not brain dead like the Democrats....for one thing it costs this country over 200 billion per year for illegal aliens payout as opposed to $5 billion for a wall....do the math...its common sense to do the wall...
Stopping the wasteful Trump monument is the important thing.
No what‚Äôs more important is not spending a bunch of tax payer money when you said someone else was going to pay for your pet project.
Don't fold Buddy you got the Trump card.
‚ÄúI think that anyone who‚Äôs been familiar with the southwest border and the terrain ... kind of recognizes that building a wall along the entire southwest border is probably not going to work,‚Äù Gil Kerlikowske, the commissioner of the CBP since 2014, said shortly before leaving office last Friday.
This whole thing is a disgusting waste of time and money. What kind of 'leader' wants to shut the government just to bully his way to a 'win'?

You just got $800 BILLION more dollars for defense - you can't find the money in there?? Ask the DOD to repay the $12 TRILLION they LOST. Come on, man, we're hurting out here.
Agree wholeheartedly Mr President.   No offence though. I caught Ur address from the Oval office. YOU  NEED  TO  BE  ABLE  TO  STEP  BY  STEP,  EXPLAIN  YOUR  REASONINGS  BETTER Sir.  But I wholeheartedly agree with U Mr President
The ONLY thing Democrats care about is blocking you regardless of what you‚Äôre trying to do!  Then in 2020, they will say that you made promises you couldn‚Äôt keep.

The liberals are not concerned about the security of the USA.  All they want is "POWER"  If they can defeat this wall then they can declare themselves a winners.  They will be all powerful and pass any impeachments and obstacles that they want
The FBI of Los Angeles just said to me on the phone that investigating drugs is not a federal matter.

So first year we save 270 billion Next yr we save 275 billion Wow that's simple math for democrats to understand Looks to me like wall pays for itself and is a money maker

How about instead of sending 54 BILLION in FOREIGN aid, you take care of Americans first!!!!!!!!!!
Valentina Hansen I totally agree.  Why are we blowing away $54billion  on countries that could not care less about us.  Use that money to build the wall.
He should not be doing it at the expense of those of us who work in some of the most stressful and dangerous positions that no one else would
The FBI of Los Angeles just said to me on the phone that investigating drugs is not a federal matter.
Yeah, but they don't want a wall.  How about you keep America safe by resigning?
Is your promise based on studies and and expert testimony or just a political whim?
Pres. Trump says there's a 'national security crisis' at the southern border that justifies shutting down the government -- but illegal border crossings last year hit a 46-year low, and the U.S. military has already sent home half of the 5,900 troops that Trump ordered to the border before November's election.
native American you are suppose to be smart..guess not
Taking welfare and ssi from the people is not helping us. Alot of people are gonna be homeless cuz of trump he is a pis

How about using our resources to actually serve the people....no wall.
It's obvious to everyone, if they are truthful, that their main goal is to stop Trump from fulfilling his promises, rather than work in the interest of America and its citizens.

Your promise was Mexico will pay, not 'We the People'. You lied. Again. As usual....
James Mattis‚Äô resignation letter.   Dear Mr. President:  I have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.  I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.  One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.  Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions - to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.  My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.  Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.  I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.  I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.
Help me understand. Democrats say border crossings are down, how do they count them if they sneak over where there are no walls? Help me understand Democrats say drugs come in through truckers. Should be able to stop them? None come in where there is no wall?
I'm american, it's not my #1 concern.
Funny that you cut tons of programs and things when you first went into office saying we had no money for health care and education and so forth but all of a sudden we have money for a wall? Are you lying to us again, Donnie?
Mr. DJ Trump I am sure that the members of the house, the speaker of the house, and the senent wasn't elected to block what you are doing to protect America and it's borders. I have noticed that these same ones go out of their way to block your plans, even if they wanted the same thing when they were in Obama's cabinet and presidency. Please don't give up your plans, you are doing a better job than any one before you. I praise God for you.
Your promise is whack! You just want something built with your name on it.
It‚Äôs all about you it doesn‚Äôt matter what you are in favor of they are against a bunch of terds
Everything you promise will be rejected by Democrat because they want you to see fail on your administration. Illegals are Democrats safety net voters. Why was Obama and Democrats gave 150 billion dollars cash to the enemies and not allowing to protect US citizens?

Gian Dovidio that analogy makes you look like a idiot. Just fyi. Do we put a wall on east and west coast?  Canada?  Its a 10th century solution thoughtof and supported by people who are intellectually challenged.
Shawn Caulder they are both the same thing in principle. the government functions like the rules of a household on a bigger scale. people who live in a home are governed by those rules, and walls of a home are meant to allow authorized people to enter just as the walls of a country are meant to only allow authorized people to enter. its interesting how you do not seem to be able to internalize such an easily understood idea
yes there should be a southern and northern border by 2030

Securing the border was supposed to happen already, President Obama said he would do it, what happened?  Before that 30 yrs ago after President Reagan granted amnesty . All the walls and fences in Europe to keep immigrants out and smuggling out but that's ok.
Clearly the Democrats ARE offering border security. Pelosi agreed to a lot of what you asked for. Only sticking point is the wall. The wall will not be effective. You lied about that and a lot of other things.  STOP LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!!

If we would stop paying the illegals that are already here, the ones held at the border we could..  You are paying congress and the illegals becky lao,,  unless your on welfare..  then we're paying for you also..
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
You can't fulfill your promise if you need funding from outside of Mexico.

I doubt anyone will read this or take this seriously, but I'm going to say it anyway. Instead of building a wall, why can't we build a set of barracks every say hundred miles, then from that have a set posts every 20 miles in between, then send our National Guard there on their 2 weeks a year and maybe a couple weekends a year? Man could you imagine the benefits of that? Our National Guard would get actual training. We pay them anyway, the labor would be cheap... Then if someone would decide to invade America from the south they'd be screwed cause we could send our troops to these barracks. If the national guard isn't enough people, then also let I.C.E. and the border patrol use these facilities.
You damn right!!!!!

Kyle Sakamoto God had a wall build check it out it's in the bible ,keep reading you might learn more than that stupid.
Historically, walls aren't the most effective. Time after time throughout History, walls were built and failed. Walls didn't stop Alaric's sack of Rome in 410. Walls didn't stop the sack of Constantinople during the 4th Crusades. During the Medieval era, walls were built around cities and there were Catapults and battering rams and other siege weapons that destroyed those walls.  Read some of the historical texts from Locke and those who influenced the thought of Early Americans and the Founders.  I argue that if Washington and Jefferson were to be brought back in this era, they would argue that walls are not needed and not American. They would probably argue that after rising against kings and queens in their era to have a more Democratic system of government, that perhaps the next stage involves forming more partnerships with other nations and countries and that being Nationalistic and Isolationist is not the best direction for our nation to progress.  How about you study History and Theology and do Biblical exegesis instead of believing the lies of those in power and being driven by fear of those different from you. Go on a study abroad or cross cultural mission trip to South America and learn to appreciate the customs of those who we deem as the "other."

Instead of using fact checkers, they should just add a laugh track to Trump's speech. Hit the laugh track every time he lies
More than TWENTY-FIVE TIMES, President Donald J. Trump demanded a government shutdown in an attempt to force the American people to fund an expensive, ineffective border wall he promised Mexico would pay for. #TrumpShutdown
We sure do NOW DONT GIVE IN TO THEM!! No compromise without wall funding-veto EVERY SINGLE ONE of their bills til they stop obstructing! Dems care nothing about American citizens, our security or economic well being!
No, President Donald J. Trump, the "dims" will try to stop you at every turn...BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF AMERICA LOVES YOU!  They can only succeed if the majority loves them!
Historically, walls aren't the most effective. Time after time throughout History, walls were built and failed. Walls didn't stop Alaric's sack of Rome in 410. Walls didn't stop the sack of Constantinople during the 4th Crusades. During the Medieval era, walls were built around cities and there were Catapults and battering rams and other siege weapons that destroyed those walls.  Read some of the historical texts from Locke and those who influenced the thought of Early Americans and the Founders.  I argue that if Washington and Jefferson were to be brought back in this era, they would argue that walls are not needed and not American. They would probably argue that after rising against kings and queens in their era to have a more Democratic system of government, that perhaps the next stage involves forming more partnerships with other nations and countries and that being Nationalistic and Isolationist is not the best direction for our nation to progress.  How about you study History and Theology and do Biblical exegesis instead of believing the lies of those in power and being driven by fear of those different from you. Go on a study abroad or cross cultural mission trip to South America and learn to appreciate the customs of those who we deem as the "other."
Times they're changing remember. Promises promises promises parole parole paroles. C'est pourquoi ? Forget your promises and be realistic! Dear Mr President., üò≥üòî‚òï‚òïüèÉwanna coffee? üòÄ
Keep the government shutdown. Build the wall. Clean the swamp!
There are lots do,sir. Stop wasting time on this and work hard to position your country back to the top
The brown people are coming!  The orange man says the brown people are bad. He tells me to be scared.  Scared is great.  I am orange.
And we the people know it! Build the wall! Demonrats biggest fear is the truth and the American people
You promised Mexico would pay for it.  You took full responsibility, nay, PRIDE, in shutting the government down.  Your lies aren't working.
You are so proud to shut down the country. Your words.
Stand your ground Mr. President! Millions of Deplorables are behind you!!!
Stopping you they don‚Äôt care about America!!!
You can fool some people sometimes, but you can‚Äôt fool all the people all of the time.

Your promise was and will forever be known that " We're going to build a Wall, a great wall!! Aaand MEXICO'S GOING GO PAY FOR IT"!!! Liar!
And in the end they will. when they are no longer coming into our great country. And costing us millions of dollars every year. And no longer killing our American people.
Dave Tuttle he will not get his wall, he will get money for border security. I think you should thank your lucky stars that a terrorist doesn't try to pull another 9/11 while our government is shutdown while a few hundred TSA saying "I don't care, I'm not getting paid!"!! When there is no incentive for their being present people care less!!

Obama wanted a lot of good things an obstructionist GOP stopped.  Welcome to reality. Not tv
Bro, no one is stopping you from having mexico pay for the wall like you promised. I dunno what you're trippin about. Democrats say mexico should pay too lol, get it done then.
Fasten you seatbelts folks ,I seen a sign and that sign   reads ,stop the hate or you will be haltered .  Signed by God .
Mr. Pres. I have a great idea to solve this shutdown and stickier boot into the Democratic Party's mouth. Tell them that you will give them the hundred and $150 billion in foreign aid, And make sure they give you the $5.8 billion for the wall. Here's the deal breaker, but I think this might work. The $54 billion if they want to add to that foreign aid, and you should do this like on camera so the whole world can see, that that $54 billion will be spent at home here in America to take care of and fix the homeless problem. Damn I need to be in politics. Because not only the Republicans would be satisfied, the Democrats would be satisfied and now America would be satisfied that is both parties would be spending $54 billion to help solve the homeless issues. Damn I'm good. Let me know what you think Mr. Donald J. Trump !... let me know if you want me to come work for Sir . /Salute - Oh and I'm prior service too Mr. President =)

Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States of America, he is MY President, he is YOUR President, He is OUR President, you do not have to like it, but We The People do not want to hear your whining and crying, so put the pacifier in your mouth and have your mommy change your diaper because that is the only thing you can get changed, then get into your safe space in the fetal position for at least the next 6 years.
All border security is needed. Right now, most of it is shut down due to your Shut Down, that you claim you own. We all heard you. The 3rd shut down in less than a year.   How can you hire and keep the best and brightest, if you refuse to pay them? You're destroying our country.
Sorry they don't count. Only the democrats wants are taking  presidence over the needs of the American voters
Fox entertainment is just that! Try a different source!
The DumpTrump Controlled The House And The Senate For TWO YEARS! WHY DIDN'T THE REPUBLICANS GIVE HIM THE MONEY FOR THE WALL!!?? BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT IT!! WHY WAIT TO FIGHT WITH THE DEMOCRATS?? Y'ALL BETTER WAKE UP!!

Opening the border so people can get paid and then discuss the issue with democrats. It‚Äôs not fair how we have to hold the Americans people hostage for this.
Which people? Trump is a manipulator. Don't be fooled. The wall is a scam. So us most everything Trump says or does. He's also a miscreant, a fraud, and lewd. Don't lose sight of these.

Just please reopen the government. Millions are in need of food stamps, military retirement pay and many more of pay checks. Please mr. President
Keep it shut Mr. President...the millions she talked about can get a real job in the private sector....surely they are not that incompetent that only government can offer them a job?
Edward Dennis Toppe shut up idiot
Ha Ha...thanks for the laugh....yep, all you can do is resort to name calling....you know I am right.
Build the Wall!
Why is our media arguing against the wall? They're supposed to be reporting on the pros and cons....not lobbying against our President enforcing OUR sovereignty!!! If the President is elected because he promised a wall...then of course he should do everything to build the wall.
We as a nation have been very blessed for a very long time. I can‚Äôt believe God would have us treat and talk about these people, many innocent and truly wanting a better life like your ancestors, the way Trump and others are doing. Hasn‚Äôt enough barbarism happened everywhere white peoples have settled? You‚Äôre not superior and God I think is teaching you that right now, especially Trump.
Those who supported walls, fences, barriers, etc. for the US-Mexican border BEFORE the current POTUS took office, but now have some hardliner's objection to it, also have a moral and political obligation to explain why they have changed their minds. If these partisan tools can't justify their reversal with REAL WORDS, then they should be ignored for disrespecting our intelligence.
Keep the government closed until the wall is completely built! Build the wall!
Ha Ha...thanks for the laugh....yep, all you can do is resort to name calling....you know I am right.
You looked at the TelePrompTer. You did not look the camera in the eye the way Presidents give Addresses to the People of the United States.  It was awkward, monotonous and numbers sounded very inflated.  You were told to make this address despite your better judgment.  It was weak, and left it to the Democrats for a solution.  Weak and very unpresidential on your part.  Open the Government. Set talks for border security.  You can do it immediately.  Congress will still try to find their zippers.
The same year that Trump's FCC Chairman Ajit Pai killed broadband privacy and cheated Network Neutrality to death, the Trump tax plan delivered a $20B windfall to AT&T -- both Trump and Pai claimed that the measures would stimulate the economy and trickle down to the rest of us.  Now, AT&T is saying thank you to America by prepping mass layoffs in ten of its operational hubs in New York, California, Texas, New Jersey, Washington State, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, and Washington, DC. They've also cut investment in broadband rollout.  https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxeg/atandt-preps-for-new-layoffs-despite-billions-in-tax-breaks-and-regulatory-favors
A wall would employee lots of people on a BS build, with drug trade being a billion dollar trade , I am sure they can come up with quick ways  to put holes in the wall.
There are real hard drug dealers. There are real terrorists. There are real cartels. Oil and drug cartels are puppet mastering our nation. It has to stop.
The corrupt CNN and MSNBC is colluding with the Democrats to spread lies and cheat the üá∫üá∏ of the Wall boycott those crooks and imprison them
Build the God Damn Wall! You want to come in do it Legally! DACA Sucks!  BUILD THE DAMN WALL!
How is it possible the Liberals, Socialists, and Democrats do not want safety and security for American citizens?  More importantly, why in blazes would anyone vote to put these knuckleheads in office as elected officials allowing them to spread ....fertilizer to the entire planet.
Build the wall. Secure our borders. Keep America and Americans safe. President Trump you are the greatest President America has ever had. Please once again secure our borders.  Prayers for you President Trump.  May God always Bless youüôè

You are supposed to represent the people of this country. You are clearly incapable of that job, as you are oblivious to the fact that the majority of this country doesn‚Äôt want your wall!

Yes, WE the people want more border security!  Democrats do not care about the American people!  Don't end the shutdown until the Democrats want to do the right thing and fund border security.  WE the people stand with YOU, Mr. President!
Subash Shrestha loves you, President Donald J. Trump
On 21st December Donald Trump tweeted  ‚ÄúWith so much talk about the Wall, people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol, ICE and our great Military. Remember the Caravans? Well, they didn‚Äôt get through and none are forming or on their way. Border is tight. Fake News silent!‚Äù So after being ‚Äútight‚Äù on 21st December  there is now a national emergency?
Americans do not want the wall. That is a mis statement.  Only a few want it, most think it is a scare tactic.    Try using an independent source not Fox.  You might get accurate and unbiased information if you made measured and thoughtful actions and statements
You will not overthrow the government of the United States of America tonight.
Only your 38 % raicist base want the border wall, as you Donald the CLOWN Trump would say "SAD "
Stand Firm President Donald J. Trump. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Maybe they haven't heard of them insurgents that have been pretty much going to war vs natives and Americans using guerrilla tactics. Trump is right, the terrorists are real homegrown or not, America and the reservations need better security and better laws.
How many people have a fence around your property? Why do you have a fence? Do you have locks on your doors? Why?  Take a moment and think about the question.
Nancy Pelosi DC ph# (202)-225-4965 left message... build the wall. Here's Chuck Schumer DC ph# (202) 224-6542. Repost numbers. Let's do this...Build the Wall! Everyone call!! Fill their machines with BUILD THE WALL!!!‚Ä¶ #Trump #Trump2020 #MAGA #BuildThatWall

Vicki Oldham  Child, that was campaign rhetoric.  You didn't expect Mexico to wtite a check did you? It appears that with the mess at their border because of the caravans, they are incurring some expense. We also have a new trade agreement with Mexico.

Get it done, or shut it down. God bless you, Mr.President.
Thank you President Donald J. Trump!!
They Prefer Sending Money To The Foreign Countries For Obortions,Instead Of Keeping America safe.  Take There Pay And Hold It.
If they do the actual fact-checks; Trump has been fighting/stating the same for over 20 years about border security; its not ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù to him‚Ä¶meanwhile Schumer and Pelosi have signed for the wall 16 times already‚Ä¶ Who are the liars here?

Look, have you ever in your life been to the Mexico border in any state that it‚Äôs shared? I have a couple of times. It‚Äôs just as dangerous as being in the woods and walking past a hungry bear before winter. Women are raped and their clothes are left on trees as trophies! You‚Äôre clueless!

You are playing the stupidest game with semantics.  Replace the term ‚Äúborder security‚Äù with wall and the statement is false.  You need to recognize we all want secure borders, your the dim wit that keeps making it about a wall
Stand strong most of the American people are on your side.
No but you lied that Mexico was going to pay for it,maybe you asking wrong folks to pay for your wall for border security.

WALL IS COMING. GET READY. TRUMP HAS THE AUTHORITY. GAME OVER. ;)
Not even you wants a wall. Otherwise you would not have backed out of the funding compromise before Christmas. Enough to find the wall for 2 years. Shame.
Ever have the feeling you've been cheated?  https://www.justsecurity.org/62156/terrorists-southern-border-myth-reality/  Taken at face value, rhetoric from the White House and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would lead Americans to believe that the United States is facing a terrorism crisis at our southern border. The picture being painted is one in which thousands of terrorists have been stopped crossing our southern border to infiltrate the Homeland. If that were true, that would indeed be a crisis.  In reality, no such crisis exists.  Our federal courthouses and prisons are not filled with terrorists we‚Äôve captured at the border. There is no wave of terrorist operatives waiting to cross overland into the United States. It simply isn‚Äôt true. Anyone in authority using this argument to bolster support for building the wall or any other physical barrier along the southern border is most likely guilty of fear mongering and willfully misleading the American people.  Why do I know this? As Director of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) from December 2014 until December 2017, it was my job to lead the government‚Äôs efforts to collect and analyze all available information about terrorist threats to the Homeland. It was my responsibility on behalf of the Intelligence Community to synthesize and present that terrorism picture to our most senior decision makers ‚Äì up to and including the President of the United States ‚Äî so that sound decisions could be made about how to protect the Homeland from terrorist attack.  Here is ground truth on this issue. Terrorist groups like al-Qa‚Äôida and ISIS spend time talking about, brainstorming and even fantasizing about ways in which they can do harm to the United State. At times, those conversations have certainly included discussion of ways in which terrorist operatives might be inserted into the Homeland. But we also knew from intelligence reporting that terrorist groups have very high regard for our Homeland Security capabilities, including our border security. They know we had become a much ‚Äúharder‚Äù target than at the time of 9/11 and that getting their operatives into the United States is an extremely challenging proposition. Cont-

Let the president do his job protect America, build the wall protect our boarders. Americans want border security.
Build the wall just tell the cia to lower their coke prices
I think Republicans are smarter than Democrats these days, despite being of the left-wing persuasion. And before you think it's none of our business here in Europe, remember your country is quite important to all of us. God bless The President!

So put money towards more ICE agents. better vetted and trained, creating jobs in the process.  Put more money into weapons and tools for border agents.  Put more money into tech for better surveillance and tracking.  Enact safer gun laws to protect our citizens from the real threat of Americans who use Ar-15's against our schools and public venues.  Be sensible, factual and actually do some good, instead of lying to the people you're supposed to protect.
We people can see what the democrats are doing.  They are using their personal opinions of the president, to make themselves appear more powerful, and try to damage his future and accomplishments.  It's not about what the democratic people want that should determine what happens to our money, alone. It is about what we the people want.  We  the people voted our president in office, because we see what he is capable of doing. Not to let the democrats stop the president in fulfilling his promises to us, the people. Seems to be some very disrespectful, devious, jealous and rude people in the democratic party towards our president. Democrats who think they are right to ridicule our president, are not right.   It doesn't matter, whether you like the way our president acts, behaves, walks, talks etc.. What matters is to stop holding the president back, from his potential talent. Just because you, are afraid to be hidden behind, and want to be heard, doesn't make your actions correct.  Show respect. Stop hindering our President progress... I have never seen such disrespect, towards any other president in all of my life, as I see with this president. We the people don't want our President to be disrespected.

As we are American company and we pay tax and our ID company is     EIN 35-2517909  DUNS: 004044035  My case is related to what is happening in Jordan with tobacco and cigarettes and it is in summary:  I entered container 40 feet of American cigarettes to Aqaba port and my goods had been stolen and someone put bricks instead of my cigarettes and I face many problems with the custom and till date nobody is helping me to solve it ..  We had talked to the Jordanian government about the problems faced by American companies in Jordan. I have encountered a problem with customs for two years.  1- The goods were sold according to official invoices and received a check in progress according to the custom in Jordan and export. 2 - The goods were cleared and loaded in containers 40 feet under customs supervision and a customs lead was placed. 3- The container was delivered to the customs team's patrol according to the duly written book. 4- The customs circular book was received from the customs office of Aqaba, which is subject to inspection of the lead by the competent examiner at the container port. 5- A description of the customs at the container port has been explained that the goods inside the container smoke are identical to the customs declaration inside the yards of the port. 6 - When reviewing the clearing company of the port of containers to pay the port fee did not find the container on the port system and was informed port for field research. 7 - The representative of the clearance company was informed that the container according to the cameras entered the port at 2:34 pm (note that according to the cameras entered the port the previous day at 11 pm). 8- The customs of the port have been asked to inspect the container on the fact by the commission .. Where bricks were found instead of cigarettes inside the container .. Based on what has been made it is quite clear that the responsibility lies between the Jordanian Customs and the Aqaba Container Terminal beyond any doubt.  Because of all the above I lose my money and I couldn't enroll my children at school or send them to State to study there.   I want a solution because we collapse because of this problem.  On the other hand , I can't pay to the bank mortgage and my house in Jordan at risk from the bank ..  I need from your highness to solve my problem so I can teach my children and pay for bank .  Your quick reply is appreciated.   Thank you for your time ,   Moe AL Hazzam MO Hazzam

Stop calling them Democrats. They are no longer Democrats. They are Communists. Party first. Country last. Communism's core tenant.
The sad part about your comment is that it has nothing to do with what is best for the country. All that matters to you is getting your way at all cost. The facts don't support much of what you say. You lied to us about who would pay for the wall. You lied about carrying the mantle for the shutdown. You lied about being proud to shutdown the government, holding it hostage and putting 800,000 people out of work. Working together means give and take on both sides, and not everyone else should give and you just get to take.
Hold all the pay for those who don,t want the wall Release The Names Of All Who Used The slush fund. Make Them Pay it Back. More Cleaning Needs To be Done Mueller Belongs In jail with comey,rosenstein,Kelly holder,Rice Lynch,Schiff Clapper,Brannen Obama clintons And more. Get The Scun Out..
OPEN the portion of goverment that YOU are holding hostage!! What's wrong with you??? You are the one that said "I'll take the blame and NOT blame you Chuck!!!!!!! What's wrong with YOU?

Drey Claude This is not a Trump issue. You must be 2 year's old. It's been a big issues since. President Reagan. Bush Clinton bush Obama all recognized it. Finally someone wants to fix it
Federal workers on Furlough.....Do not give in.....Stand Strong Donald J. Trump Vets for Trump Why would you support someone not paying you.....hmmm.....That is because you are a true American and also served your country. Civilians have no concept of what freedom cost and want to whine about you or I not getting paid when in reality ,WE WILLINGLY go without pay because it is the right thing for the people and America first. We get our money back paid, they also do not know there are Emergency Relief funds available if you get bound up and need to get money, also when offered the job you sign a contract knowing you will work without pay if this happens. Americans want the freedoms United States provides as long as someone else is willing to provide them at no cost to them. They fear Gov. shutdown must be affecting their lives in some way because Democrats are telling them it is. Well it is, they are being led astray for open boarders, which is against our own countries laws to support. Another it is us We the people who care for the illegals. Our money , we earn for OUR Family is taken from us to care for them. The more that come into the country the more it cost and Democrats want more to come over 500,000. On average $18.00 a day per illegal in the country. Millions of dollars a day and more every day and Democrats say send them on,  our American Citizens will pay for more. Thank US the Democrat with your vote... Republicans did not want you. They wanted to put the American People FIRST. How RUDE....

Do you feel like all the drugs that have been pouring into this country and all the gun runners crossing into America and the gangs that keep people from leaving their homes after dark speaks to being safe?  There was a day when parents were not fearful of the kids playing ball in the yard or walking to the corner store for a treat OR the ice cream man? Today children are not free to live like the days of yesterday because this is now the home of drugs evil and destruction.  It is a terrifying place for people.  We are no longer the home of the free.  We are not free.  We are slaves to our government and the other riff raff who do not belong any place but prison or sent to the place they ran from to bring terror and destruction to a place that was once proud and strong and clean.  If government would do the job we elected them to do without being the greed ravaged froup it has become America could be great again.  But the Lord will have to return to clean up the mess now.

Ann Parish Harper I agree.  Mexico would rightly never pay for a border wall.  I was being sarcastic.You can see what I wrote on his facebook page tonight.
I QUESTION, HOW IS ALL THE DIVISION AND THE HATE AND FEAR MONGERING AND EVIL THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? IS THIS ‚ÄúTHE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE‚Äù? GOD BLESS AMERICA? COULD GOD SOON BEGIN TO WONDER WHY? IS AMERICA BECOMING NO LONGER WORTHY? IS THE END NEAR? IT‚ÄôS TIME TO CHANGE TO PLEASE GOD!
God don't mess with a son of a b****
Mexico will paid the wall? Trump need to pay taxes and pay the wall :)
ONLY THING THEY CARE TO DO IS STOP THAT WALL AT ANY COST! ... EVEN IF THE COST IS  THE DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA AS WE KNOW IT... LOOK AT THEIR ACTIONS...
Boarder security and a wall are two different things! You just want the wall because of your inflated ego...smh
Actually any of the polls I have seen recently say 56% of Americans DO NOT want the wall.  http://fortune.com/2018/12/12/trump-border-wall-poll/
No matter your political standing you must love and protect your country.  Just hating 1 man is not a good answer, grow up.
Ann Parish Harper I agree.  Mexico would rightly never pay for a border wall.  I was being sarcastic.You can see what I wrote on his facebook page tonight.

You promise Mexico will pay the wall.

Trump is now pinning his near-term political future on his promise of a wall that would no longer be a wall, and that neither Mexico nor Congress is willing to pay for. All of this in the service of a campaign promise that never had broad public support in the first place. Trump supporters are a minority in this country, not "we the people".
Americans want you behind bars. The end.
Azzahra Nur they will through Tariffs if it's even 1 to 2 percent that pays it back fast
THE RUMP is the enemy of truth, justice and honesty and the enemy of REAL AMERICANS !!!
If Trump declares an "emergency" it just proves he's the biggest baby on the planet. There is no "emergency", you blubbering drama queen.
Use your emergency powers. Enough with the  communist enemy with in our own government  and their lying  propaganda  deep  state media arm. Expose them all. Talk straight and tell the whole truth.
The only thing needed to prove fake news is Hillary won oops wait a second

If you declare an emergency, when there IS NO EMERGENCY. that is ABUSE OF POWER.  More ammo to get you impeached, so go ahead.
We've needed a wall for a long long time and finally we have a Pres. that has the cajones to do something about it. That's why the Dems don't like him 'cause he can't be bought . This man loves this country so much that he gave up practically everything to protect our country. Close the borders till the Dems cave. The ball's in their court. MAGA 2020!

His main campaign was to secure our borders and we voted for him to do what he promised he said he would ... now the Dems want to say that , that is not what the American people want? WHAT?  Are you kidding me .... we would only want Legal immigrants to this country not ones who think they can just push and free load off us and expect us to change our laws.  Do you taxpayers want to pay for these illegals . The healthcare and housing , food etc that we would have to supply to them gives them handout that we Americans don‚Äôt even get!!  You either come her legally or stay out !!   BUILD THE WALL
It will cost us American taxpayers way more money than this dang wall will cost to build!! Unbelievable!!
We are all sick and tired of these evil Dems President Trump !! Ct here !! Trump 2020!!!‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏ MAGA please !! Border security should be a priority !!
My President is being Obstructed by Democrats from doing the job We The People overwhelmingly elected him to do. He promised us border security and protection, and we want OUR tax dollars used to erect ‚Äústeel slats‚Äù, not brick walls like surrounds the Obama‚Äôs and Pelosi‚Äôs mansions, to name a few. If the Dems continue to obstruct the work of our President, maybe they should be paid by merit/hour? Something We The People should consider discussing to vote on for the next election!
Yes we do, and do do they! They do not want to give you success!!  Democrats say: see below quotes...  "Illegal Immigration is wrong, plain and simple. Until the American people are convinced we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress." -Senator Chuck Schumer, 2009 "We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented and unchecked." -Barack Obama, 2005 "I voted numerous times‚Ä¶ to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in. And I do think you have to control your borders." -Hillary Clinton, 2008
It will cost us American taxpayers way more money than this dang wall will cost to build!! Unbelievable!!
Trump will be remembered as the greatest economical President of all time. Obama will be remembered as the transgender bathroom free cellphone food stamp president. Us Republicans haven't seen democrats so upset since we took away their slaves. The democrats are going down faster then Bill Clinton's pants in a Arkansas whore house.

Liz Hall  I'm a DECENT American citizen, work, pay my bills, and educated!! I just don't agree with the method he's using to get what he wants. It can be accomplished thru other means without hurting so many people in the process. I'm not looking for a fight just stating my opinion, and it's my right!! I guess you weren't taught, "If you can't say something nice maybe you shouldn't say anything at all."
Liz Hall  REALLY?

I want to know , since when does anyone get to go on National tv and debate our President of the United States? WTH! I don't get it! Pelosi and Schumer have an under mining agenda. I don't know about you, but they are freaking scary. This would have never happened in any other presidency. I demand that Pelosi and Schumer should be removed from office!
so many parrots in here, lol

THERE IS NO CRISIS..YOU ARE A STUPID IDIOT..CONGRESS PLEASE IMPEACH THIS MOTHERFUCKER
It‚Äôs really sickening the way MSM is covering the anticipated speech and saying it‚Äôs not going to be factual and there is no crisis.  Get all your facts out there ‚Äî especially the fact that they are proposing money from our budget and tax dollars to build a wall in Tunisia.  The minuscule percentage of the budget that 5B is and the billions paid out every year in ‚Äúsocial programs‚Äù for ILLEGALS, including the cost of sanctuary cities, prison, opioid epidemic, human trafficking etc.  There better be a comprehensive plan of immigration reform, e-verify, a census with the citizenship question on it, cleaned up voter rolls, a consistent election process in all states, etc.  Do Dems not want it nor see that you were elected because you promised this reform ‚Äî it‚Äôs not a political promise it‚Äôs the job you promised to do.  And it‚Äôs what we voted for.  They offer no solutions, just opposition.  Design the wall based on what the border patrol tells you they want and need ‚Äî not the Dems.
President Donald Trump is the best & he has made national security a priority. The liberals are only a stumbling block because he will build the wall. Trump for the win. #MAGA2020
You are correct President Trump.  It is 100% about keeping you from winning in 2020.  The Dem's hate America and are obsessed with power at levels unimagined in our nation's history.  Keep fighting, because we really have nothing left to do.  We love you and we love your beliefs.  We know your heart and we know that you are our last Hope.  If the dems win, the nation is doomed and we will be flooded with cancers disguised in human flesh that will be unbeatable. We will be poisoned till death as a nation.  Please keep fighting.  I am so glad that Lindsay Graham is on your side and he is willing to back the TRUTH. Keep fighting Mr. President we love you!
According to Nancy Pelosi's own speech, "only 2,500 ILLEGALS came across the boarder last week." According to her own speech about a week ago, each illegal "only costs the US Tax payers $70,000 a year." So lets break this down into "factual" numbers according to Ms. Pelosi. Those 2,500 illegals will costs the American Tax Payers $175,000,000.00 (that is 175 MILLION) in the next year. If the 2,500 is an average week then that is 130,000 a year in ILLEGALS. It will cost the American Tax payers over 9.1 BILLION DOLLARS a year to support them! This is only to feed, house, educate and give them health care. If any of them commit a crime and is arrested, then the figure goes up because then US Citizens PAY to DEFEND them! These figures come from the Nancy Pelosi's speeches to convince US Citizens that there is no crisis at the board. REALLY??? Democrats use them to SLAM Trump but neglect to give the full picture! Wake up America and BUILT THE WALL!
Donald Trump you will get the wall and a lot more.  And of course, Pelosi and Schumer will take credit for it.  Obama will say he orchestrated it back when he was just a freshman chimp.  But who cares, you're getting the wall.
I am certain it's to stop you from fulfilling another promise.  But, hopefully the Dems will grow up and realize that our nations future successes depend on building this wall. The American tax payer can not keep paying for housing and food for all of these illegal people. We already have enough homeless and hungry people to care for.
"Illegal Immigration is wrong, plain and simple. Until the American people are convinced we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress." -Senator Chuck Schumer, 2009  "We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented and unchecked." -Barack Obama, 2005  "I voted numerous times‚Ä¶ to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in. And I do think you have to control your borders." -Hillary Clinton, 2008
ILLEGAL isn't a RACE..ITS CRIMINAL.  The people who claim its inhuman-where are they with American Vets? Homeless citizens? THIS Border Security is about trying to destroy Pres Trump..and to allow more illegals into the US... IRONICALLY the DEms want BACKGROUND CHECKS for US CItizens BUT not for illegals?? Besides increasing disease, crime, human traffiking, drugs AND hundreds of thousands of illegals without skills/education/money or the ability to be independent... and these illegals want to be on the welfare of American taxpayers-----CAN the DEMS give us reason WHY we should have open borders???
SHUTDOWN: O.K.  Again.  Let me try to explain the procedure again:  Let's say that Trump gives up on getting the wall funded. *stick with me*  Does that immediately end the shut down?  For the people who received an indoctrination instead of an education, the answer is NO.  The HOUSE needs to pass the bill *the CR*.  Then it goes to the SENATE for approval.  Once both the House and Senate pass the bill, THEN it goes to Trump.  If Trump signs off on it, the CR becomes law and the shut down is over.  If Trump doesn't sign off on it, the shut down continues. Then and ONLY THEN, it will be a Trump shut down. I know I lost most of the Democrats with this simple but TRUE example, but that's how it works.  NOW:  Explain HOW the shut down happened?  A bill *the CR with wall money* passed the HOUSE and went to the Senate.  The SENATE did NOT pass the bill because they need 60 votes and there aren't 60 Republican Senators.  So the bill *the CR* NEVER made it to Trump to sign or to veto, which means Trump DID NOT cause the shut down and IS NOT responsible for those who are not getting paid.  Trump is trying to find ways to GET THOSE PEOPLE PAID.  I know that I lost the rest of the Democrats who believe, despite the truth, facts and the legislative process, that Trump is responsible for the shut down. If people want to blame anyone for the government shut down, Blame Schumer and his sycophants in the Senate for shutting down the government and starving sick children and single mothers.
The Democrats don‚Äôt give a rats ass about the American people!! They just want to stop President Trump from for filling his word!! unlike that Traitor Obama!! It‚Äôs time we bring Obama to justice!!! Arrest And convict him of treason!!! And if the minorities want to riot in the streets. We got nationalguard to take care of that problem too!!
I'll keep posting it until these Democrats get it through their thick skull. Technically it's not "his" wall, It is America's wall. I'm not trying to offend you in any way. I'm just trying to explain that the government is designed so that before January the government sits a budget for agencies and proposed bills, the budget has to pass through both branches of government before it will become settled. Okay, since we get that our government is designed this way, many presidents before Trump has shut down the government. Including Bill Clinton twice (Full government shutdowns, not only a partial) & Obama (During 2013, to pass obamacare with even more funding and costs) which was a total disaster and we spent 2 billion dollars on a website for obamacare that still to this day doesn't work. He forced Healthcare down Americans throats or they could be jailed for not having it.Under Obamacare, you must have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. For 2017, the penalty is $695 per adult (up to a family maximum of $2,085), or 2.5% of household income, whichever is greater. HE FORCED IT DOWN OUR THROATS! FORCED IT! He added more debt to the U.S. government through obamacare than any bill in history and and caused the U.S. debt to raise exponentially more than every previous president COMBINED. I want to be clear, the Democrats supported a border wall and border security before 2015 when Donald Trump ran on this issue. They're actually videos of Hillary saying that she supported legislation to build a border-barrier across the southern border to stop illegal immigration. This plan however is being held up by the Democrats because they want to see Donald Trump fail and not get the wall. NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR RHETORIC of walls not working because every wall that has ever been built for illegal immigration including China's border wall built in 1960, helps stop illegal-immigration. In fact, 65% of the world is covered in borders. It's just the way that it works. The border wall that has been proposed by the Republicans requires 5.6 billion. That is 0.1% of the Budget that they have agreed to on funding the government which would have no affect to any Tax-payers because you wouldn't notice a 0.1% increase to the budget.Newly released research by the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) done for the Department of Homeland Security indicates that 170,000 illegal immigrants crossed the border successfully without going through a port of entry in 2015. While a significant decline in crossings from a decade ago, it still means that there may be 1.7 million successful crossings in the next decade. If a wall stopped just 9 to 12 percent of these crossings it would pay for itself.DEMOCRATS: -Voted against Kate's Law -Voted to keep Sanctuary Cities -Voted to expand catch and release -Voted against increased vetting on refugees -Voted against legislation to remove gang members -Voted against the deportation of violent criminal aliens. -Voted against funding for a wall and increased border security. It wouldn't affect anything.For the one's who say that "walls don't work" & the ones who say that "We don't have an immigration problem in the United States." Yes, we do. (Yes I have prior knowledge of the Berlin Wall & why it was wrong, the Berlin Wall was constructed to keep people in instead of keeping them out) China has had a border wall next to Hong-Kong since 1960 to keep illegal-immigration under control. In 2015, Hungary built a border barrier on its border with Serbia and Croatia. The fence was constructed during the European migrant crisis. Attempted border entries have fallen since the barrier was constructed. During the month of September 2015 there was a total number of 136,296 migrant entries, and within the first two weeks of November the average daily number of intercepted migrants decreased to only 315, which is a reduction of more than 4,500 each day. Israel cut its illegal immigration rate by "99 percent" by constructing a 143-mile fence along its southern border from illegal immigration about 16-17 thousand apprehensions to only 18 people period, so if you tell me that border walls don't work I'm going to refer to the statistics until you can prove me otherwise
Arrest all alien enemy Invasion who voted here for espionage and apply the law that states no UnAmerican activity can serve in Congress Standing in front of a Foreign Flag with Pride is treason. You have the power use it Audit arrest espionage and send the military to census California. Your statement about needing Foreign Nationals pizzed a lot off USA kids were denied seats filled with Foreign Nationals... you promoted replacing us with them .

So, you would rather the dems  give all the tax monies to illegals instead of to vets?? You aren't making any sense! Trump wants the wall so that illegals will stop bleeding us dry so that veterans get care FIRST instead of criminals

Glenn Lord Sr. My, my, you are such a strong believer in our Constitution, aren't you comrade?
And you are holding back vets much needed money over all this unnecessary nonsense! Shame on you! You know a lot of them need meds and counseling and rehabilitation and doctors and to pay for their and their families to have housing! You are heartless, cold blooded and selfish and on a very big ego trip and people are or will suffer. That‚Äôs not good! You‚Äôre not a good person.
And I am not your comrade or your friend, in fact you are part of the evil trying to turn our country into a communist state.
He mentioned how the Obama's have a wall around their house. Well that seems wise considering ALL Republicans are fucking psychopathic gun hungry want to be racists and killers.
And I am not your comrade or your friend, in fact you are part of the evil trying to turn our country into a communist state.
Build the wall.  It wont prevent illegal invaders totally but will significantly reduce their chances to get in.  We have been Promised a wall since Jimmy Carter but it has all been talk and no action.  The majority of Americans support you stay strong.
Yes Americans want Border Security Democrats want Border Security everyone wants it except you Donald Trump you want a wall. So what's more important your useless wall or putting Federal employees back to work because both Republicans and Democrats have pushed bills with Border Security funding and or Government Funding and you've said no because wall Funding was not written in. You own this shutdown you initiated it and now continuing it.
Children in flint no water companies in Florida dumping cancerous toxic waste at our back door killing everything causing salt water fish to be extinct by 2048, cost of living constantly goes up every month trump is in office as it is and going to be worse with this wall. So it makes exactly 0 sense to build it.
26 days Clinton shut down 16 days Obama in history of government shut downs only 3 times republicans controlled house  stay strong secure border stop all taxpayer funding to ALL illegals in country and get term limits with ban on lifetime benefits
They  don't care about America they just want to see failure. I stand with you Mr. President. We needs more border patrol, and ICE, we need the wall. The American people , the taxpayer can not bear the burden of paying for never ending caravans and all their needs.I'm not against immigration. But it must be done legally in a organized manner. Congress, Chuck and Nancy, the Dems .and the Luke warm Rep. Get busy do your job.

For two solid years Trump has had the White House and the Republicans have had control of both the Senate and the House.    In the two years that Republicans controlled it all they won a few very hard fought battles.   Democrats fought hard but were unable to stop Trump's Tax reform bill, Supreme Court Justice appointments, and Federal appointments.    Now Trump wants Americans to believe that the reason his wall has not been built is because the Democrats have stopped him.  He couldn't get enough support for his wall from his own party.   Now that the Democrats regained control of the House, Trump is using Federal Workers, Federal Contractors, farmers, the list goes on, and the most vulnerable among us as collateral damage while he throws a temper tantrum and shuts down the government with threats to not reopen it until he gets his way.   Prior to shutting down the government, Trump proudly stated on national TV that he would take the full credit for the shutdown and was proud to do it.   Now suddenly, none of this is his fault.  It's the fault of the Democrats who for two solid years were just trying to keep their heads above water because of the power and control Trump was wielding.   The success of the Democrats in the Mid-Terms are a testament that the American people overall are not happy with Trump's presidency.   One of the corner stones of Trump's campaign was to build the wall.   I'm personally old enough to remember when Mexico was going to pay for it.  :)   Trump is nervous about his bid for re-election.   He feels he has to get this wall up as a matter of his own political survival.   Shutting down the government is a serious issue.   Trump is using the government shutdown like an impetuous child.  He doesn't care who gets hurt.   He spews hate and fear to Americans rather than working with his own party as well as Democrats to come to an agreement on rational border security measures.   His is not the behavior of a rational person and most certainly is not acceptable for someone holding the position of President of the United States.   He is acting more like a terrorist than a president.    Disgusting.
Karen Harvey the pathetic one is Grump, a HUGE PATHOLOGICAL LIAR, AND PUSSY GRABBER PSYCHOPATH, WHY DONT YOU,, ALL HIS SUPPORTERS, AND HIM PAY FOR A WALL THAT HE PROMISED OVER A THOUSAND TIMES THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR??? NOW MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LIKE MYSELF SHOULD BEHELD HOSTAGE , WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS TO PAY FOR A FUCKING USELESS WALL THAT 75 PERCENT OF AMERICANS DONT WANT, AND DONT CARE FOR??  HE SAID THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR IT, WTF HAPPENED TO THAT LIE HUH??
I hope you bring up charges for treason against Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer Dick Durbin and anybody else that has boldly stood against the protection of America. All while they tried to pass a 54 billion dollar foreign aid Bill.

They all knew Chuck and Nancy did a crappy job on rebuttal, because they kept sending out more and more moronic Democrats to say something, Bernie, that drunk driver Beto from Texas, and the crazy Cortez chick all came forward. Then the professional liars in the corrupt media took over to tell us why Americans don't deserve protection, and why illegals should come ahead of US citizens. I watched none of it, I turned it off after the POTUS spoke but, but my daughter's twitter feed was on fire. Great job Mr President, stay strong, your voters are still with you.
The game is uncovered.. Bring more illegal immigrants to get more votes for the (democrats!!) . Build the wall .
Democrats  are also killing ILLINOIS,
When will the liberal voters realize these Democrats are as fake as plastic and could not give two Hoots about anyone but their own egos ...winning politically is all they care about... that means votes getting votes and getting more votes from the dead from the prisoners from the illegals more refugees more refugees more votes... Libs to all illegals: we will give you free housing free money free tax refunds free welfare free healthcare come to us all you who are burdened and we Democrats will do whatever we can to warehouse you in poverty crime and squaller all of you just vote for us ... and guess what the stupid lame & wimp Republicans won't speak up and stop us
I hope you bring up charges for treason against Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer Dick Durbin and anybody else that has boldly stood against the protection of America. All while they tried to pass a 54 billion dollar foreign aid Bill.
Build the wall and take pay away from the Dems while the govt is shut down
Split the country in half.  Democrats on one side Republicans on other.   Bet anything Dems will need our assistance. #changemymind
What i didnt understand of what the democrats are saying Pelosi and Schumer is ridiculous. The border needs to be secure. They are giving false facts. What's their answer to the killings by the illegal immigrants???? But Pelosi and Schumer don't care.
Maybe President Trump should just use all of the time on air playing the past Democrats views on the border and illegal immigrants.  Pelosi, Schumer, Obama, Clinton‚Äôs and Biden.  Then their air time would be trying to explain what has changed.
The Republican Congress came up with a budget in December that passed the Senate 100-0. Trump agreed to it at first, but then backed away because Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, and a few other right-wing media activists told him not to sign it because they didn't like that it did not address his wall - it had prior been suggested that border security and the wall be looked at with separate funding. When Trump backed out, he took responsibility for the shutdown. He even said so publically on television. So to deny that Trump is solely and utterly responsible for this is outright delusional and a perversion of the facts.
"Illegal Immigrants" are not immigrants, they are invaders. Immigration is a legal process. A stand against the wall, is a stand against the Constitution they took an oath to support and defend:   U.S. Constitution - Article 4 Section 4 - The U.S. Constitution Section 4 - Republican Government. The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.
Build the wall.. And id love to throw Polosi and Chucks ass over it! Democratic Party is a bunch of idiots.
In the 80's, and probably today, as well, I'm sure California would know. We have two air-force bases, numerous National guards, several hundred ballistic Nuclear missiles, the shortest distance to the major cities in Russia, a dam, that if leveled by them, with 600 feet of water behind it would level every dam down the entire Missouri river system, possibly stopping near St. Louis. Sometimes I don't care what those stupid liberals in California want. North and South Dakota had to live through the "Cold War" very differently than they did, We would have been the first place hit in an all out nuclear war. But, it made us tough. I don't think California would want to mess with North Dakota. Who gives a crap about money. We got plenty here in this state, a surplus. How you doing California? Also, the Government shut-down, and the China negotiations, are actually having no effect on us here. We got plenty of grain bins. Please understand President Trump's point of view. Short term tough times, for our future generations. This isn't about him, or even me, and he knows that. It is about our kids and grand kids, long after I am gone.California, go fight for yourself. I as a North Dakota guy would fight for my neighbor, but I am done fighting for your twisted politicians.
It's $5 billion out of $40 trillion of one year's budget.  I suggest that if you aren't vigorously fighting other forms of wasteful spending as hard as you are this, you simply are speaking out for one reason. You hate Donald Trump.  So what is the harm if we over protect our border? What if it slows the flow of illegal drugs just enough to save a few lives. I know my family has lost a couple young men to drugs over the last couple years that maybe would still be here if it wasn't so easily accessible.   What if it keeps just a few murderers out of our country. Isn't it worth it? Haven't we wasted money on worse things than this?  Are you so petty that you would oppose this out of spite while not opposing the other billions we waste or the $50 billion a year we just give away to other countries?  It's $5 billion out of $40 trillion of one year's budget.  I bet most of you never fought so hard for such a small percentage of the budget.... until Donald Trump became your president.  Seems pretty obvious to me what your motives are!
Congress will not listen anyway so we need to start looking into that problem as America is tired of the silly things going on.  Build the dam or wall and let President of the USA finish a job that should have been done 30 years ago.
Can you tell Nancy Pelosi our values are American lives.  Can you tell Schumer American lives are the most Nobel cause and worth every expense. And tell the Democrats to stop lying saying they  want border security The American people are not stupid because their actions do not match their words.
It‚Äôs pretty obvious to anyone who isn‚Äôt a complete idiot that they will do anything to keep you from doing things that you promised to do, because they all know as mostly ‚Äúcareer‚Äù politicians, that you are only supposed to tell people what you think they want to hear, and never actually carry out anything that would actually HELP your consistency. And, you also should talk out both sides of your mouth and change your position on a given issue any time that the wind changes direction! And, like Obamacare, (said Speaker Pelosi) ‚ÄúYou have to pass a bill first in order to see what‚Äôs in it!‚Äù And, like John Kerry, sometimes you can be ‚Äúfor something before you are against it.‚Äù They are all scum-sucking SWAMP CREATURES! Build The Wall!
President Trump: It‚Äôs time to order the arrest and deportation of undocumented DACA and illegal immigrants simultaneously and immediately in all sanctuary cities. So, Democrats will have no way but to give the border wall funds not only $5.6B but for  $25B in exchange of DACA temporary stay pending the passing of comprehensive immigration law. Americans are waiting for your iron fists and we will be supporting you to exercise your emergency power to utilize existing military defense funds if border walll funding bill failed at the Senate and thereby, strongly execute immediate arrest and deportation undertakings  for the protection, security and safety of the American families and children.
I thinks it‚Äôs funny how people are bitching about this government shutdown when Obama did the exact same thing for freaking Obamacare.  At least a border would help keep criminals, drugs and illegal immigrants out our country.
And the United States needs a wall
They disagree with you Pelosi and her crew.  You are right in what you said.  Let them open their gatesst their homes  or let them go for a jog in New York or California by themselves with no security or even. Mlm their family.  Lets see how many illegals may hurt or kill them.  I as an Anerican born and raised here want a wall.  Put all our tax dollars to use in our country not given out freely to other countries.   Stay strong please.   Don't give in please.  I want my grandkids to live in a better America. And you are the one to do it.
Wish, we could have you in Europe. You're the best leader entire planet. Drain the swamp in Europe too, please POTUS üòç
This is the Chuck Schumer Shutdown, Schumer is like a little spoiled brat! Chuck talks out of both sides of his mouth! Schumer, Obama, and Hillary all have said they want a wall but today if they would give money for a wall, it would be a win for the President! They don‚Äôt want the President to win bottom line! I want the wall!
In the 80's, and probably today, as well, I'm sure California would know. We have two air-force bases, numerous National guards, several hundred ballistic Nuclear missiles, the shortest distance to the major cities in Russia, a dam, that if leveled by them, with 600 feet of water behind it would level every dam down the entire Missouri river system, possibly stopping near St. Louis. Sometimes I don't care what those stupid liberals in California want. North and South Dakota had to live through the "Cold War" very differently than they did, We would have been the first place hit in an all out nuclear war. But, it made us tough. I don't think California would want to mess with North Dakota. Who gives a crap about money. We got plenty here in this state, a surplus. How you doing California? Also, the Government shut-down, and the China negotiations, are actually having no effect on us here. We got plenty of grain bins. Please understand President Trump's point of view. Short term tough times, for our future generations. This isn't about him, or even me, and he knows that. It is about our kids and grand kids, long after I am gone.California, go fight for yourself. I as a North Dakota guy would fight for my neighbor, but I am done fighting for your twisted politicians.
@SpeakerPelosi The Democrats are not just calling the president a liar they are calling DHS Liars border agents Liars ice agents Liars American people Liars they won't even listen to these people all of these people should sue their employer fornot making their jobsafe timestrike
They'll do anything to obstruct. Build the wall and tear down the Democratic Party. MAGA
Build the wall don't give in to those low life liberal thugs that put every thing and every illegal above America and our citzens. Stick to your base we elected you to drain the swamp.
My last words your is the worst president ever United States of America you worse than bush I cannot depend on you no more never did New York City we all know you for the crap but I guess is what it is the worst president ever in the United States in America
Yes, we need border security.  Thank you President Trump for fighting.  Stay strong!  We need a barrier & immigration reform.  üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ Democrats continue to show that they don‚Äôt really care about the American citizens- only illegal immigrants & their own power.
Let the working people get their paychecks and the poor people get their food stamps! Stop Congress paychecks and the senate paychecks. But all of us that weren‚Äôt born with a silver spoon in our mouth might need to feed our children!
Send all the immigrants to California. It will wake them up
Nancy pelosi. Headed off the cliff and trying to take us with her. She headed to the devil pit
I don't know how you do this job for free to take care of a country where so many people bitch and complain!! I would've quit a long time ago and let them get screwed! You are AMAZING!
They do not want to w9rk with Trump.  They never wanted a wall or more secure boarder.   SHAME ON OUR SENATE AND CONGRESS
Soon u build the dam wall they gonna build damn tunnels to still come thru to the United States
Time to remove Pelosi and Schumer
F Mexico. Don't want those peasants to pay. The American....true Americans will pay.
The Dems have proved what they want, Socialism to take this Country down.  How disgusting for them not to be American enough to want to do what is best for it.  Just like NY Gov and Ca,  govs wanting to give illegals free medical, while we taxpayers foot the bill.  That's not even crazy, it's downright evil.
Mr. President, do not falter or sway (not that you would). You have been so good for our country.  This Democratic Party has ulterior motives... to keep our nation divided. There‚Äôs gotta be a way, a law, a loophole to start getting these treasonous people off capital hill and out of our government.  How can people who do not protect US citizens hold any political office?
I want to puke whenever I see these childish so called democratic leaders screwing up the country I fought for! Now Wisconsin doesn‚Äôt have a governer! That skinny little weasel screwed us all the first day in! We should all have to pass an SAT test before we can vote! Of course that is set up by teachers so forget that idea! Oh boy am I screwed!!
The Border Wall is a very Important part of the Security, Protection and Safety Of our Country and our Citizens and the Far Left Liberal Democrats were for it when Obama was in office but they are now against it because they Hate Trump!! What a bunch of Hypocrites these People are!!! They are all about themselves and Power hunger and don‚Äôt give a rip about the Security, Protection and Safety Of our Country!! They have made their millions and billions of dollars and some have become wealthy from and in America but they don‚Äôt want to give back and do what‚Äôs Good and Right for America!! We are seeing the true characters and who these Far Left Liberal Democrats are And how they are using America for their profits and catering to Illegals and outsiders!!! Unite and Prepare ourselves for Trump 2020 and Stand Up for Our Country and be Bold to Keep Our Country and our Values!!! Pray for Our President and All the People in His Administration And also for Our Country!!  Lina
Here's my suggestion, place robocop out there he can secure the border. Well shoot all the intruders, use your drones blow them up, use your anti-personal & tank mines. Electrocute them thru fences or walls whatever you plan to build out there. Airstrike em use your gunships, attack helicopters. Place the fear of God into them and what the people are all about blowing sh*t up and shooting all intruders that try to enter without proper documentation. Well its all an inside job you and your admin say people this, people that, its all inside and already orchorestrated long ago and planned ahead of time what things need to be done. Dont forget us natives to this land here up in Alaska, we need structure and much help, stop letting the federal gov dictate our way of living up here in the great State of Alaska. We need to hunt, fish, eat, and work just like everyone else in the lower 48. We aint rich like you, if your too rich to earn your wage and decline your wages as president give your wages to me. I will be.
Nancy pelosi. Headed off the cliff and trying to take us with her. She headed to the devil pit
Bad news for Liberals I found out through my sources that..... Nancy Pelosi is an illegal Immigrant
Dear President Trump,  To get the funds to build the wall cut all of the exorbent benefits that the Senate and Congress are given. Let them find their own insurance and pay what we the people have to. We scrimp and pay and can barley survive on what we make.  Let them give up their tax breaks, insurance, take a huge pay cut, this way they can actually see what the American people are dealing with. You sir, are already setting a grand example with taking no wage. We appreciate the fact that you have done this.  There are to many senators and congressmen and women who have made millions off of the American people.  Sir, it has been awhile since we have had a person in the Oval Office who actually loves our Country. The things that they are proposing to do will not help the border Patrol any. We need the wall.  Better yet, make the ones who are protesting the wall live in border towns without their walls and security. Make them live in the neighborhoods who are turned upside down from drugs and gangs. The Congress and Senate live in a fantasy land they need a real dose of reality.  Strip it all away, make them live as we the people live.Let them live with the reality of their idiotic bills and laws they make. Let them walk in the shoes of our law enforcement, soldiers, border patrol agents etc.shoes. Hit them where it hurts, like they do us.   President Trump,  My husband and I stand beside you and what your trying to do.  Keep up the good work.  Cheriee
As the House of Representatives welcomes its first two Muslim congresswomen, Texas Republicans will vote on Thursday over whether to remove Tarrant County Republican party vice-chair Shahid Shafi from his seat because he identifies as a Muslim-American.  The vote comes after some members of the county party put forth a motion to remove Shafi, a Republican trauma surgeon and Southlake City councilman, from his position due to his Islamic beliefs.  Dorrie O‚ÄôBrien, a precinct chair, expressed fear that Shafi would uphold Islamic law over the U.S. constitution and that he might be related ‚Äúto Islamic terror groups.‚Äù  Bunch of racists
I definitely hate DemocRats/Liberals/Socialists. Got to do something about these idiots!
We want more than that Mr. President, we want the swamp criminals in DC that have been selling our country out all these years to be prosecuted and incarcerated!
Build the wall or keep the government shut down stop pay for senate and house redirect those wages to pay federal workers.
Build the Wall!  Send the Democrats there to see it for themselves but probably won‚Äôt change their small minds. They like illegal aliens, drugs, child endangerment and human trafficking and future democratic voters. Stand strong President Trump and God Bless you and America. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

Duh stopping you from lying to the gullible American people. You lie so much that they have live fact checkers listening to the lies that come out your mouth. Mexico not paying for the wall, coal industry is evaporating quicker than it did when Obama was president 4000 terrorist lie was debunked immediately, all the living president said they never spoke to you about a wall you claim they did, the wall is going to be made out of concrete,steel, fence,gate,cotton,paper etc.the Democrats need to talk to that doctor that claim mentally your sane lying to the American people should not be allowed every lie will get debunked with facts
Curtis Burke a lot of them actually do belong there.
CURTIS. AMEN!

Build the wall and put Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on the other side.
LOL All the Dems got is shutdown! They don't even talk about the American people that were killed, raped, and beaten by illegals. They don't even tell you about the walls around their own home or how they wanted the walls before Trump got in office. Dems need to get out of this country!
Yes; we do want border security. The Dems who won‚Äôt support Donald Trump are all about hatred. They prove repeatedly they don‚Äôt care about US Citizen safety. They are protected with armed body guards daily,  homes with walls, and videos showing their support of a border wall during past administrations. They are lying hypocrites putting our country in greater risk each and every day. They are so afraid if they agree to fund the wall that Trump will be re-elected in 2020. They are willing to risk our lives with another 9/11 or worse!! We are talking about ‚Äúillegal‚Äù immigrants here; ‚Äúillegal‚Äù being the operative word! If some disastrous incident occurs, it‚Äôs all on you Democrat‚Äôs and your blatant political anger. You‚Äôll never have a Democratic President in the future if you don‚Äôt protect this country, because we won‚Äôt forget who was really responsible for any terrorists acts!!!!
Border security, safety, for the U.S., the citizens is a must.  We have been promised a barrier for 3 decades, promised Comprehensive Immigration Reform only to see it die, ignored, dismantled before our eyes.  The economy can not tolerate the drain, expense of the vast population of illegals.  We do not have enough Border Patrol agents with the necessary tools to adequately to protect our Nation.  In 2017 63% of illegals were on Welfare.
I did not vote for the current President, but I do see the need for building a wall.  Immigrants years ago came through Ellis Island and were ‚Äúchecked out‚Äù both medically and for any criminal record.  Why do people think we should just let anyone into the country and not check them out first.  We have enough crooks in our country as it is (especially in Washington DC).   I am sure drug cartels have paid out millions in bribe money to keep our borders open.
I think if you can‚Äôt get the Dems to budge on the wall you should bus all the illegals trying to enter Texas to California on a regular basis.   See how much they can put up with before they start back egging for the Southern border wall. They want them, they can take care of them. Texas wants the wall....
I am not a US citizen and don‚Äôt live in US. Trump is the best president ever. But all democratic supporters are fool. This president wants to do so many things for his citizens, but they just don‚Äôt wanna see it. They are just too brain washed by their politicians.
CURTIS. AMEN!

I don't understand what the issue with the wall is, it's a win win scenario‚Ä¶ we create construction jobs while it's being built, dissuade illegal immigration and by doing so help raise the wages of normal American people, because ANY supply of people who are willing to work for less than the average American will bring the wages down‚Ä¶ so what if produce has to get a bit more expensive if we don't have to deal with the other negatives that come with illegal immigration: crime, drugs, etc.
As he offers alternatives and negotiates, the dems shut it down. No compromise from those scum, they deserve no respect. Btw Nancy Pelosi should be asking for the wall in San Diego to be torn down.
Democrats are only in office because of illegal immigrants voting for them
I read this post about the bird feeders and while I totally agree with it I felt it's missing an analogy to support the wall. So let me add the proper anology and explain the need for the wall. (added to end of bird feeder story)  (copied and pasted)-----> I bought a bird feeder. I hung it on my back porch and filled it with seed. What a beauty of a bird feeder it was, as I filled it lovingly with seed. Within a week we had hundreds of birds taking advantage of the continuous flow of free and easily accessible food.  But then the birds started building nests in the boards of the patio, above the table, and next to the barbecue.   Then came the crap. It was everywhere: on the patio tile, the chairs, the table ... everywhere!  Then some of the birds turned mean. They would dive bomb me and try to peck me even though I had fed them out of my own pocket.  And others birds were boisterous and loud. They sat on the feeder and squawked and screamed at all hours of the day and night and demanded that I fill it when it got low on food.  After a while, I couldn't even sit on my own back porch anymore. So I took down the bird feeder and in three days the birds were gone. I cleaned up their mess and took down the many nests they had built all over the patio.  Soon, the back yard was like it used to be ..... quiet, serene.... and no one demanding their rights to a free meal.  Now let's see...... Our government gives out free food, subsidized housing, free medical care and free education, and allows anyone born here to be an automatic citizen.  Then the illegals came by the tens of thousands. Suddenly our taxes went up to pay for free services; small apartments are housing 5 families; you have to wait 6 hours to be seen by an emergency room doctor; Your child's second grade class is behind other schools because over half the class doesn't speak English.  Corn Flakes now come in a bilingual box; I have to 'press one ' to hear my bank talk to me in English, and people waving flags other than ‚Äùours‚Äù are squawking and screaming in the streets, demanding more rights and free liberties.  Just my opinion, but maybe it's time for the government to take down the bird feeder.  If you agree, pass it on; if not, just continue cleaning up the crap!!  (Added analogy)  ......while it appeared all was back to normal I soon realized I had another issue on my hands. With the birds busy coming in droves to my feeders my attention was focused on them and not on the ants that were sneaking in unnoticed seemingly right beneath my feet. Taking advantage of the mess being left behind by the birds. Some of the ants had made permanent homes in and around my porch. While others simply came and went unnoticed taking what they wanted back to there own home.      When I got rid of the feeders everything seemed peaceful. But that was not to be the case. Wasn't long and without the distraction of the birds I began to see the ants. I went to the hardware store and got aunt traps to put up where I could see them coming from. They would fill up almost immediately but the rest of the ants would just re-route themselves and continue coming. They had found other resources to feed on inside my house and soon I had ants in my Crawlspace where I couldn't see them. But they would appear on my counters, in my trash can, in my cupboards. It was out of control. My daughter was petrified, she tiptoed around the house in fear. Me and my wife would try to comfort her and race to her screams. I tried to get them under control but no matter what I tried the ants just came and came.      Then one night my daughter woke us with a scream. It seemed a red ant colony had built a nest in my house as well. I had been annoyed with the other ants, I had even decided that spending a few bucks everyday to try and fight back was better than spending alot more hiring an exterminator. But these red aunt's were vicious. They were very aggressive and very mean. They had attacked my daughter while she was sleeping and had swarmed and bitten her all over her body.      I had had enough...I realized then that something had to be done. This was no longer just a nuisance, it was threatening my family's health and well being. I knew it was time to call an exterminator even if it would cause me to pull from my savings. It was my responsibility to make our home safe for my family.     The next day I called the exterminator. He explained to me he would need to first put up a barrier to stop the ants from coming in. That was the first step of a long process. He would use a special spray that would form a barrier the ants could not cross. He then would search in every dark space in my home to find the ants nests and exterminate them.      He then explained how much it would cost. I sat with my wife and discussed the proposal. We both agreed that it was going to be a burden financially at first. But that in time we would be able to rebuild our nest egg in savings. That in doing this we would save money in the long run by not having to put money out daily to battle the ant problem. We knew we would have to pay a little annually to have the exterminator maintain the barrier but it would be much less than the initial cost and something we could budget in and make doable. Ultimately we agreed that our daughters safety was paramount and chose to pay.     It's been a few years now and every once in a while we do still see an ant here or there. We have no idea where they get in, but when we find them we kill them and we call our exterminator and he imidiately comes to check on the situation and spray where needed.      My daughter runs and plays throughout the house now no longer worrying about about the ants. She sleeps peacefully at night. I wish I had called the exterminator sooner, my daughter should have never had to be hurt for me to come to that decision.
I heard California,and New York said they will pay for all including illegals health care,ü§î On who‚Äôs money taxpayers.....hell no let the wealthy elites pay since they want them here ,like sanctuary cities,celebrities for cheep labor ,and wealthy elites,and business people to pay as little as possible for the cleanup of their mansion and democrats to get their votes to gain power .......STAND UNITED TOGETHER AND WE WILL WIN......

The last 4 letters in American and republican are I can. The last 4 letters in democrats is rats.
We always wanted safer borders. Most Americans didn‚Äôt realize what a wreck the wall was till Obama started letting them pour in to the US. Our Government doesn‚Äôt tell us a lot and I am glad Trump is the first President that cares about Americans and wants to fix this issue that has needed fixed since 1986. Finally have someone wanting to not pass the buck. And for Democrats to cry it‚Äôs immoral is laughable. Any Civilizations have had Walls. Many countries now have same walls or better. Look at Israel‚Äôs and it‚Äôs working look at their statistics.
WE want a wall it's our family's affected by illegal not your's you all have a wall around your house

Dann Hamblin not really. Because with true change comes sacrifice. And not that bs change obama preached while he uncle tomed his way through 8 years. Real change like securing this country for the people who live here making the country better for the ones who live here. People are tired of hearing about the poor poor immigrants and illegals who have it so bad. Screw them. America first. This country has spent far too long neglecting it's own to benefit paco and his 37 kids that jump the border and get the dream handed to them. I'll sacrifice a few write offs to see this country made better for the ones who have been here and contribute to it. Than have those write off I worked hard for handed to Jose and his family.

Build A northern border wall too BOOM!
Simple solution to building the wall. Allow all illegals in, provide them with a ‚ÄúWelcome aboard package‚Äù which includes the immediate right to vote along with  affordable housing but they must agree in writing to register as Republicans/Conservatives then see how quickly Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the Resistance Party coughs up the $5 billion ü§î
Build A northern border wall too BOOM!
Exactly
Tom Moslak lmao you sir are a fucking joke . Sit your ass down you clown .
What about all the middle eastern illegals pouring across the Canadian border? This is more of a problem than those coming in across Mexico‚Äôs border!!!!
Build the wall!  Put the hammer down on city and state officials who enact fugitive safe places and obstruct ICE.  Charge them with treason
Tom Moslak What tree did you crawl out of?
The Democrats are so full of crap. My niece was the victim of an illegal. He had been deported 3 times prior to shooting her in the face with a stolen police officer‚Äôs gun and killed her. He was a drug dealer to boot.  He sold heroin and cocaine. Each time he was deported he was back within days. He wasn‚Äôt here to seek the good life and he ultimately damaged my family, almost beyond repair. There is a border crisis. It is not a manufactured crisis. It is the Democrats who are having a tantrum. I am furious! Mr. President DO NOT BACK DOWN!!! ü§¨

Build the wall by any means necessary we need it keep the illegals out.
80% of Americans support border security.  Democrats want votes from Illegal Aliens and supporters of Illegals Aliens. Fact counties on the US Southern border and in California changed to Democrat because of influx of Illegals and Supporters of Illegals.
BUILD THE WALL! STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS!
How do you Republican Government workers feel about your President now?  You do know, he can care less about you or your families.  Its all about him getting his way.  Nothing else matters to him.  Go ahead defend him now.
The new trade deal with Mexico does pay for it. Not to mention they could allocate the funds ceased from drug cartels to get it started. Then the money from the 134 billion we pay out every year to deal with the illegal immigrants once they get in could be used because the wall will dramatically drop the number getting in.
Mike Rojas doesn't matter who shuts the government down! Are people supposed to pay their bills due now with back pay? Shut up üòÇ
The Dem's Credo... Create Jobs by creating criminals, encourage lawlessness and disorder in our society. Think of all the jobs that thrive off of this negative part of society. Figures, lawyers are one of the biggest profiteers, with prisons, law enforcement, criminal justice and reform, healthcare, welfare, all the non-profits that support this system to grow... and the companies that are needed to support them. When a groups whole outlook on life is, let's just mess things up so we can profit by it, is messed up thinking. To say it politely. A lot of Republicans think this same way. Drain The Swamp!
maybe if you didn't rip off all us hard working americans with your corporate tax cuts the Dems would have let you spend 5 billion on a wall, how many billions of dollars did you rip off from the goverment with your tax cuts? if you are so fucking rich build the wall yourself!
Another thought:  When and if the Democrats ever get full power, one government run national healthcare system, like Canada, is their biggest goal - listen, actually listen to these socialists.   We will be so busy trying to get a simple cancer test or doctors appointment- we Americans might just need to climb that wall and cross into Mexico just to see a doctor!!  üò±
President Trump is the greatest President our Nation has ever had!!! It‚Äôs a shame that the enemy of our Nation (So called Main Stream Media; Also known as the Propaganda Arm of the Democratic Party) are so successful and effective in deceiving so many good Americans through their deception and lies!  I wholeheartedly support our great President who is working so hard despite the worst opposition any President has ever faced; working to protect and defend our Nation, our Constitution, our way of life.
The wall is be needed, if we keep letting all the illegals in why have laws to make people come in legally. Why have laws at all!  Our safety should always come first. Thanks for standing up for us.  Keep fighting! We Stand behind you!  Put America First!
As usual the Democrats /Liberals are stupid.
Someone kill this fool trump already. Honestly learn your own fucking history. Ms13 was founded on the streets of L.A when honest migrants fleeing civil war are thrown in with Waring African American gangs. So what was America's solutions you sent them back to  El Salvador. A combination of extreme poverty and the effect's of a long and brutal civil war allowed this group to explode out of control.   Thankfully my parents chose Australia. But your problems have been around for a long time and it's not just Hispanic Americans that are the problem. African Americans have suffered time and time again nothing has gotten better, then we can jump to the real problem in America GUN'S! how many high school shootings have there been now fucking wake up to your self Mr president Karman is coming to bite you in the ass. It might not have been you that made all the problems but you haven't helped them either
Being Democrat is a mental illness and we all saw the evidence tonight. DRAIN THE SWAMP AND PUT TERM LIMITS on the Senators and the House members.
in our state of me. they voted in a severe liberalist who is going to break our back.   democrat,of course. stand your ground mr president
When will the North wall be built? Keep those dirty Canadians out too!
The Democrats don't give a rats about the American people, what we need or what we want. They DO however care more about illegal immigrants. They will stop at nothing to stonewall OUR President even if it cost thousands of Americans there lives
AMERICA HAS YOUR BACK.  THANK YOU FOR CARING. FINALLY A PRESIDENT WHO CARES ABOUT AMERICAN CITIZENS!! #KAG
You noticed that neither Schumer or Pelosi responded to Trump's question: if walls don't work, why do you two have them around your houses?  All Democrats in Congress know why they don't want a wall. All Republicans & Conservatives know why. Who we need to get to learn why are Hillary's Useful Idiots.

Narcissistic personality disorder ‚Äî one of several types of personality disorders ‚Äî is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.
Denise Walker  Democrats won California and New York because of illegal voting.
California and New York democrat leaders are offering free healthcare for all illegal aliens no longer at hospital emergency rooms brcsuse it is a financial strain and physicslly impossible but now thru private doctors. Who the hell are private doctors going to bill? With an americsn citizen they bill their insurance company but who gets the bill with free illegal alien care? The American medical system will become like Cuba or Venezuela - doctors will quit or retire early. Medical facilities will close.
So funny watching the Dems have tizzy fits that Trump is speaking to the People. They even came out and spoke of their fear that people might actually believe the President instead of them.  Panic runs amuck.  Heh.  I would like to see McConnell bring the existing bill to the floor for a vote and go around Pelosi since it has already passed the house. I would love that one passing and leaving her to pout over her loss....Do we have enough votes with the newbies in the Senate?

Democrats have NO interest in securing our border to PROTECT the Legal citizen, they are totally focused on the ILLEGAL CRIMINAL!
Rebecca Schilling Brown Wow! That's a whole lot of typing for nothing because Trump is finished.

THIS is  what Nancy Pelosi just  said about Americans who agree with the President of the United States of America..((((This will be done on the backs of the middle class they profess to champion. All they care about are new ignorant voters.)))))   Their policies are a major disaster for the United States of America. If you have children and grandchildren, wake up so they can enjoy the freedom and self-determination we take for granted. If you don't it will disappear forever.
Rebecca Schilling Brown Wow! That's a whole lot of typing for nothing because Trump is finished.
I finally figured out why Trump leaves the White House an  takes his weekend vacations. Ready, drum roll please, Even Trump needs a break from his bullshit.   Also, I'm pretty sure Trump can issue a National Emergency to build his wall at the South Border. First we are still in a War on Terror and if Trump can prove just one possible terrorist enter the US through the South Border then securing it should be top priority also if you take in account how many Americans were killed by illegal immigrants that entered the South Border he can cite that it's in the best interest and safety for Americans to stop them from entering which would be a National Emergency. So Democrats just make the deal and get our Federal Government workers paid.

Build that wall. Stand your ground . They all wanted the wall but never did it. They just hate the fact that you will do it!
Build wall stop giving illegals benefits and stop paying those help with shutdown and if they don't want wall let's them take care of illegals and take responsibility if an illegal breaks the law in any form
Obama will go down in history as ‚ÄúThe Greatest President of all Time‚Äù.   Trump will go down in history as a clown. A failure. A traitor.   Great job dumbass.

Lisa Duarte-Garcia lol what the hell does that have to do with anything? It's about trying to fix the problems many promised but just said it for election votes. That's what you are seeing now, and honestly I don't really seeing anyone sneaking into Mexico or Venezuela or an other south american country unless they are trying to hide. Every country has its own killers, child molesters that are probably allowed to do it because child marriage is still legal some areas, and all that etc..etc..etc. is available anywhere. Maybe a wall will or will not have an impact, but we won't know till we try. I mean it works for most countries

Your an ignorant man, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you build a wall.  It will not stop American Born serial killers, drug dealers/users, rapist, murderers, bigots, child molesters, etc., etc., from being in this country.  As long as the demands stay in the USA the supply will keep coming

Why don't you and other millionaires buy the wasteland properties along this border and do as you wish with your private property... A wall doesn't have to be on an exact line of property.  They built gas pipelines for miles and miles through citizens property.  You're telling me property can't be bought that runs close to the border in a zigzag line that has a private wall built on it's property???
Nancy Edgeworth nah bitch I mean people like you and who you vote for.

You are a lunatic.....spare us impeachment and resign tonight.
All about the framing POTUS! Poll Americans and ask "Do you want a secure border?" Obviously the response will be overwhelmingly "Yes". Poll Americans and ask "Do you support the idea to build a border wall?" The response is going to be overwhelmingly "No", because most Americans know that's a stupid and inefficient strategy for securing our borders...
Who died and made you the expert? Just cause they spoon feeding you that bs .
Micheal Marceaux that's why I used the qualifier "most". I do realize there are some unfortunate souls out there in denial about the fact that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants entered the country legally, and then didn't leave when they were supposed to. I do realize there are some unfortunate folks so simple-minded they can't imagine ways to circumvent the 'security' of a wall. Don't worry Michael, I didn't forget about you, I said "most". ;-)
Justin Dewey 74% of the voters want the wall.
Carol Chisumvii per the Politico poll, 44% support the wall. Per the Reuters poll, 41% support the wall. Per the Hill poll, 34% support the wall.  Now, I hate polls. They often have flawed methodology and can be misleading. That being said, they are probably a more reliable source than your ass, which is where you pulled that "74%" number from...  To be fair if you meant to comment that 74% of "Republican voters" or 74% of "Trump voters" support the wall - I believe you, and if you edit your comment to include that qualifier, I will delete this criticism.

Close the border and stop legal and illegal immigration until all the illegals are deported no matter where they are from. Don't reopen the borders or immigration until the southern border is secure and we have a better way to round up folks who overstay their VISAs. It is ridiculous how sorry our government is performing. They screw up everything they have their get their hands on.
Why is it oue responsibility to pay you for your medical problems, cant work my back hurts,cant work hurt my neck, cant work my knees hurt, look people it is not the governments duty to provide medical and money to its citizens, it's your job as a citizen to get a job with insurance benefits
Melody Hutchison Really and what type of Pres do you think Obama was. Trump hasn't cut off benefits for those who need it. Medicare and Medicaid both received Raises and so did SS and SSI.
Melody Hutchison. Wont need to worry about your health problems if a illegal blows your ass up best be worried about that.
Missy Turner if the government doesn't reopen by the end of the month Trump has just said on the news that we're losing ALL government programs.  Call your local Social Security office.  They will tell you what I have just said. I WORKED HARD FOR MY SSA AND MY MEDICARE privileges until I couldn't do ANYTHING . I had a herniated disc in my back and c3 thru c7 are messed up.  I'm only on Medicare not Medicaid and it pays for all my medicine. I only receive  $936 a month. ] p
I have worked since I was 16 years old.  I have always supported my kids. Don't tell me I have NO RIGHTS.  I have every right to receive what I paid.

Democrat lawyers have been trying to trash the Constitution by misinterpreting the 14th Amendment to expand citizen rights to illegal aliens.  It a subversive lie.    Here‚Äôs what the Supreme Court actually said about ‚Äòbirthright‚Äô citizenship by Daniel Horowitz ‚Ä¢ October 31, 2018     Rep. James F. Wilson, R-Iowa, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee back in the 1860s who helped draft the 14th Amendment, spoke emphatically that it was ‚Äúestablishing no new right, declaring no new principle.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is not the object of this bill to establish new rights, but to protect and enforce those which belong to every citizen,‚Äù declared Wilson in 1866.  There‚Äôs no more authoritative exposition of the 14th Amendment than the first court case after its ratification, the 1872 Slaughterhouse cases. Justice Samuel Miller confirmed that ‚Äúits main purpose was to establish the citizenship of the negro‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe phrase, ‚Äòsubject to its jurisdiction‚Äô was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States‚Äù (emphasis added).  Writing for the court in Elk v. Wilkins (1884), Justice Horace Gray asserted that the phrase ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction‚Äù is ‚Äúnot merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely subject to their political jurisdiction and owing them direct and immediate allegiance‚Äù (emphasis added).  https://www.conservativereview.com/news/heres-what-the-supreme-court-actually-said-about-birthright-citizenship/

Demorats just cannot get over that Hillary lost, and will do anything to gain power and stop the president from protecting the US from invasion by illegals.  They even stooped so low as to send bombs to themselves to gain sympathy.
They don‚Äôt care about Americans, they care about power! Y‚Äôall need to impeach the judge who gave the 21 day release judgement. Just saying that is just stupid!

Pelosi, Schumer and other Democrats #1 goal is to obstruct, indict and impeach President Trump at the cost of the American people, they do NOT care about us! Democrats in powerful positions only know how to lie, cheat, steal, obstruct, spread hate/violence, corrupt, cover for each other, make everything about race, attack religion, play on our emotions, and get away with all types of crimes on their way to getting what they want. They support open borders and abortion. They are NOT above the law even though they think they are untouchable.

Remember it wasn‚Äôt so long ago that they wanted the wall and all of a sudden it‚Äôs ‚Äúimmoral?‚Äù No one talks about all the  huge corporations who want illegals in this country because they are cheap labor.

Unique among presidents, Trump has divided loyalties. He has entangled his business interests with his official duties, creating the impression, if not the reality, that his own financial interest ‚Äî not his duty as president ‚Äî guides his thoughts and actions.  The Founding Fathers, savvy students of history and human nature, were highly attuned to the risks of public corruption ‚Äî actual or perceived ‚Äî and inserted language into the Articles of Confederation and later into the Constitution to guard against such human frailties. They wanted to make sure that anyone who held a public office would serve only one master: the American people.  A farewell to kings For the Founders, public corruption wasn‚Äôt just a theoretical danger. They viewed it as the primary threat to their independence. Living in a small, fledgling country, the Americans feared that the European powers would seize control of the American democracy by flattering and bribing our officials.  The kings and princes of Europe were masters of the art. The British king had corrupted Parliament by providing titles and sinecures, a major contributor to the split between the colonies and Britain. The true history of the 1670 Treaty of Dover had just been published, which revealed that King Louis XIV of France had bribed Charles II of England with a secret pension, a beautiful and beloved French mistress, and a promise of protection. In exchange, Charles had agreed to convert to Catholicism and to join Louis in his costly and fruitless war against the Dutch, his former ally.             https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-founding-fathers-would-have-impeached-trump-in-a-new-york-minute-2018-08-10

Neither democrats just hate Americans and like killing and destroying American families!

Your promise was for Mexico to pay for it.  I think that's what the big stink is about.
When Trump says the southern border situation is a national emergency, what he really has in mind is a Trump emergency. He's the boy who cried wolf. He would send our war fighters to the border to start building a wall so Ann Coulter will be nice to him again.  "The basic factory setting on the perception of Trump is: gigantic douchebag. This is a man who manufactured fake Time magazine covers featuring himself with the headline, "Donald Trump: The 'Apprentice' is a television smash!" so that he could put framed copies of it on the walls of his clubs.  His business is convincing people with lowbrow taste to give him their money." http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2018-12-19.html
Pelosi had spoken for 8 hours about Daca. If these people are so important to her she should be willing to make a deal for them-right thing to do. Now is the time. Everyone knows our immigration system needs to be fixed so we don't have more Daca people. A wall will help secure border, reducing drugs and gangs flowing into this country. Liberals helped organize this caravan, now claim it's not so bad?  We don't want to care for anymore illegals when we have too many citizens that need help.
Here‚Äôs the thing say he does declare a national emergency and uses the money set back people will still bitch. They‚Äôll say it‚Äôs not an emergency. Say it gets the government open again. People will still bitch. The money is there to be used. This is a win-win. We get the wall and dems dont have to contribute. But I garauntee they‚Äôll try to stop him from using the money and people will still side with them.
BUILD IT & they will NOT come over it illegally‚ùóÔ∏è
Stopping u. Democrats are for Illegals instead of the American people...sad!üëé
Being responsible stewards of the budget, you fucking moron.
Keep it shut down-citizens ahead of ILLEGAL immigrants.
It's all about "your Promise"  We know You demented Adderall snorting lunatic.
They know Mr President. They know we want border security. A wall, technology, more boots on the ground.... all of it! We know that they don‚Äôt care what the American people want. It isn‚Äôt about us at all. It‚Äôs about them. Their special interests, their foreign aid, their gun confiscation, their tax hikes... the lists goes on and on. Don‚Äôt budge Mr President. We all know who owns this shut down. Let them shoot themselves in the foot. They‚Äôre comical.
i want border security  b  cus of isis  taking advantage of the fact the border is wide open  and the politicians are STUPID
Unless Mexico is paying for the wall you're  not fulfilling anything so stop patting yourself on the back.  You are a big fat liar.
All I can say is I hope there is no Thunderstorm and Lightening tonight while Trump is standing there telling all those lies...he will get struck down and burned to a Crisp!! Lies will always come back to haunt you!
Until an illegal shoots one of them, they won't be behind you!

Diane Glauber Also, I‚Äôm pretty sure I smell your cat from here! ü§Æ
The two obstructionists Pelosi and Schumer represent the two largest Sanctuary States in the Country. Where do you think illegals flock to the minute they sneak in? How the hell can anybody in their right mind vote for these two criminals. Elections are definitely corrupt and fixed. Especially in those two States.
how the hell did they  come in   for 9 11 it wasnt crossing the borders cubans came in by boats they come in by tunnels semis crossing canada borders  get the fricken truth meth is made in usa murders and rapist are here and the biggest con are the presdient his family and goons he is a  fricken traitor to our country
so many brain washed trump spporters who    believe his lies instead of facts just dont the kool-aid
They are not interested in one thing or the other, they are concerned about their own skin. In other words, they will try to get you in the pan in every possible way. Even with the worst tricks and feints. Be assured. The snot lives and keeps trying to kill you. Flatten them before they do.
Protect our country Mr. President!! Stop the *rats from trying to ruin our county. Can't spell *democrats without rats. Please secure the country and continue strengthening job numbers and the enconmy. Don't listen to all the bots they have manifested on Twitter and the hatters that would reject the cure for cancer if it came from you!
Trump.....................hunanitys.   Hope.  Against.  devil
A wall doesn‚Äôt secure our border!!!  It steals land via eminent domain from Americans. It kills animals. And it won‚Äôt stop people or drugs!!
His followers are as delusional as he is. This idiot could shoot their mother and they would still think he's God.
If anyone believe they don‚Äôt want a wall they need to think if someone in your family members were killed by illegal how would they feel . One more death of Americans citizens being killed by illegal is one to many.
its time to take out the trash Mr President and while your at it, any government shutdown should include those who cause the shutdown. Law makers cannot make laws they are not obligated to live by, please get that changed. Law makers should be held to a higher standard.

Build the Wall  No Amnesty  Don't let the swamp tangle you up in court on the state of emergency.
I want border security but a stupid wall is a really dumb waste of money.
Sorry Mr President, but that is a stupid question!  Stopping you is much more important to democrats. They don‚Äôt care about the people who will die, every day, at the hands of illegal aliens, or the drugs and disease they bring with them. They have completely abandoned the protection of American citizens and their rights. It‚Äôs called TDS!
TRUMP you had two years of complete control and your GOP didn't get it done on the wall. Its your shutdown your fault get Mexico to pay for the stupid wall.
Great address to the nation, President. Trump, regarding the national security crisis we are facing at our southern border and the ABSOLUTE need for an up-to-date barrier for the SAFETY and SECURITY of the AMERICAN PEOPLE!üá∫üá∏  Chuck and Nancy (Dumb and Dumber) looked like a couple of IDIOTS trying desperately to explain why the American people don't need the best safety and security possible at our southern border!!!!
Via technology ... not a medieval wall ... your promise was Mexico would pay for it, ya dumb fu@k.
Oh stop... Dez Ippolito!!..white men r very few..but they DON'T get by with NOTHING..illegals have been proven to break OUR laws... hurt ..rape..kill..that's how u show..u want in our country??....Hopefully UR legal..if not go home..stop trying to make trouble here in America blaming white men..if u do a per centage..in prisons b4 opening ur discrimination mouth...it's Mexicans and blacks..so u stop ur discrimination against whites just to get ur way!!.this is OUR..

border security, keep government shut down until Demorats decide to negotiate on border wall/barrier/security whatever it is they want to call it. Stop funding sanctuary cities that choose to break the law and house illegals, let them do it on their dime not ours. What foreign aid can be halted no money anywhere until secure borders 30 years is long enough to kick this can down the road.
Democrats are only interested in hurting America.  Filthy trash.

Maybe all this wall obsessing makes Trump tired. He certainly seemed low-energy during his Oval Office address. ‚ÄúHe makes Jeb Bush look like a combination of Mighty Mouse and Bruce Springsteen,‚Äù a friend of mine said after the president finished his nine-minute speech to the American people.  For every viewer whose response to the talk was ‚ÄúWow, we should do something about immigration!‚Äù there must have been a hundred whose first reaction was ‚ÄúWhy does this man keep sniffing?‚Äù Deviated septum? Nasal polyps? Trump‚Äôs breathing has actually sounded strange for a long time, but most of us have chosen to ignore it rather than engage in a national conversation about the president‚Äôs nose.  If you watched the address ‚Äî and really, you could have, it was only about as long as it takes to microwave popcorn ‚Äî you saw a 72-year-old guy squinting at the teleprompter and making rather alarming breathing sounds while reading a speech about how we need a wall to protect women who are ‚Äúsexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.‚Äù  This is not a man who should wrap his arguments around the idea of protecting women from sexual assault. But also, gee, he sounded like Uncle Fred who you haven‚Äôt seen for a while and suddenly he shows up for Thanksgiving with weird colored hair and vacant eyes and he‚Äôs talking into his mashed potatoes. Gail Collins, NYT ü§£üòÇ
Build the damn wall!  I am sick and tired of my taxes supporting other countries and illegals .
We need the wall and we need politicians who do not support their OWN COUNTRIES CITIZENS but instead support illegal immigrants and foreign countries  before America to be relieved of their jobs!!
Look, you lying narcissistic moron. Enough of your lies, Mr Dennison. Tread Carefully tonight.
Donald Trump is the most inept, corrupt and unscrupulous embarrassment the US has seen.  History will judge him as a traitor.
FB is censoring this:  Build the wall.  If it can stop 1 rape tree, stop 1 child from getting raped or trafficked, stop 1 murder, stop 1 terrorist from entering and spreading extremism like a disease, or stop 1 load of heroin from entering our county and destroying 1 life, etc. It's worth the price of the wall.  YOU CAN'T PUT PRICE TAGS ON PEOPLES LIVES CITIZEN OR NOT!
BUILD THAT WALL no matter how you get it. Tax the hell out of all those places they send money to mexico and it will be paid for. also NO NEW illegals on welfare/food stamps or free healthcare.that alone will save money on the wall.
Illegals are important to the democrats
Maria Shafer Shut your ole dumb obviously misinformed ass up .
THIS AMERICAN wants the damn government back to work, and then you idiots can play your damn games. You're putting the whole country at risk with the TRUMPSHUTDOWN!  Meanwhile more terrorists have come in from Canada, but I don't hear you talking about building a NORTHERN WALL!!
Yes but not a fucking wall that Americans are being told they have to pay for! What happened to the Mexicans who you said were going to pay for it? Friggn loser!
Stupid dems living behind walls daily.... lol
BUILD THE WALL ,tell the democrats to go to hell
How long Is a stupid political class going to allow illegals to come in and drain our treasury and kill our people?????  This is being done to America on purpose folks!!!!!  BY THE STUPID RATS!!! PRESIDENT TRUMP I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT ANY LONGER! Mr.President Trump call "State Of Emergency" and "Build That Wall" now and lock all of these commies up.
Lier lier pants on fire!!! Americans with common sense do not want to blow 5plus billion on a wall. Trump is looking to line his pockets and the pockets of his pals. That‚Äôs the only reason why he wants a wall. You said Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Make them pay for the wall like you promised and open our government back up. America is not one if your crappy or failed hotels.
It is as simple as this if we only enhance border security by putting additional troops at the border our troops will get criticism for shooting the drug dealers that are coming across illegally. What other option would they have since they are not coming in one by one but in droves. A wall will keep them out and ultimately safer than enhanced border security.Mexico has already offered them asylum and many took it but many did not. They have killed many of our border agents by throwing rocks and our president has issued the okay for our agents to defend themselves so be careful what you wish for. This is an invasion orchestrated by our very own Democrats in our govt. Our president is not going to blink, the stakes are too high.
It's obvious what is important to those devils, but stay strong Mr. President.  Build the wall and make America great again.
Useless wall. Just like your useless wig on your head.   Neither accomplish anything.
Illegals are important to the democrats

Yes...Let me be clear...I'm all for securing our border...Technology can do it cheaper, more efficiently and with less environmental impact. Spend my tax dollars on technology! NOT on a STUPID WALL!  https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/03/19/high_tech_surveillance_critical_for_effective_border_control_113214.html
Unless YOU'RE DUMB, DEAF AND BLIND, WE ALL know damn well the last TWO YEARS REPUBLICANS and Trump held ALL the power! WHY didn't they get this done? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FUND A DAMN SLOGAN! The Republicans knew it, Trump knew it, and even his campaign knew it was just a slogan "to keep the attention of The Stupid Party". Donald Trumps OWN WORDS! What an abuse of power and a waste of money to all the networks. But hey...it's not Trumps $ so who gives a damn...right?
These are not just Demirats your dealing with. They are Anti-American monsters that are dead set on destroying America! Let's END THEM!
Build the wall!! Then Lock her up or vice versa
15 of the 19 terrorist responsible for 9/11 were SAUDIS !!! Just a theorie......Saudis planned the destruction of the twin towers, so the US had a reason to ask them for help to fight against Taliban and Al Queda....for that they needed a lot of weapons from the US. Good deal for both ....thinking ...
Border security is of the utmost importance to our nation. What many people don't understand is that legal immigration is one thing ,but illegal immigration is quite another. We need security on our southern border ,and we need it now! Our President, is trying to protect and defend our country from foreign invaders and should be applauded not admonished for it.
Brain dead dems couldn't care less about the American citizens. They only care about the illegals so they can get their votes I the illegals are too blind to see it  & they don't care, all they want is an open door into America & all the handouts. !!!!
Democrats are damn fools and the enemy of the USA!!!
Cherokee Roze oh you must be related to nocahontas..

There is no need for a multi billion dollar border wall. There is no need to force the separation of all families at the border.  There is no need to deny unfortunate refugees the opportunity to apply for asylum.  Illegal border crossings are at a 46 year low.  The situation at our southern border is not as dire as Trump's hysterical tweets suggest. Illegal immigration is not an existential crisis. We are in no danger of losing our country.   The Trump Administration has intentionally adopted a policy of cruelty towards immigrants, and they rationalize their policies by relying on unsubstantiated claims that they pose a threat.  Day after day Trump and his allies resort to fearmongering, scapegoating, and demonizing.  Folks at the southern border have been maligned as rapists, murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and criminals who have been infiltrated by terrorists, and are threatening to spread infectious diseases, while they steal jobs from hard working Americans and simultaneously sponge off the social welfare system because they are so lazy.    Scant evidence has been offered to back these claims up, but when your goal is simply to dehumanize people you can't let hard data get in the way.     Early estimates had put the cost of Trump's wet dream border wall at $25 billion, and that's before any unforeseen cost overruns.    The whole thing strikes me as a terrible waste of resources that is sure to excite reactionaries, but does nothing to solve the underlying issues that compel people to immigrate to the US via any available means.    If the US spends billions on a wall, what have we got when it's done?  Just a wall.  That's it.    It won't improve conditions in the regions in the world where people are suffering.  It won't stop the people living in those regions from attempting to enter the US.  It won't reverse the demographic changes underway in America that have so many entitled Caucasians decrying how minorities are destroying the fabric of society.  Why should we persecute people for losing the birthplace lottery?   Why should anything as universal as wanting better opportunities for yourself and your family be considered criminal?  Instead of building walls to divide us, I would prefer inviting those less fortunate to share in the promise America can offer.
Tyrone Brummeyer to long.

This foreign Institution has been doing Financial business with Donald Trump and the Russians. This is the tie. This is the proof. This is the Big Kahuna. But you guys just keep on getting distracted by the stupid wall but make no mistake, he knows all about this and he has been fighting this tooth and nail since September. He called in all 10 DC circuit judges to weigh in on this and one of them recuse themselves. And guess which one it was yep one of his former nominees and former legal advisor.

It's truly sad that the democrats hate Trump so much that they risk all of our American citizens safety. To hate one person so much and put so many in danger while they live behind their gated walls! And to top it off to want open borders for illegals to come into our country and get benefits that American citizens can't even get! Power hungry democrats want that almighty vote and the only way to get it is to keep the border open and have illegals vote for them!
hey ted cruz is offering a solution. please look at it. build the wall using other money and F the democrats. they are showing the rest of the country how useless they really are!

Yes, he needs our prayer. Prayer works and God will make a show of all this evilness. We are in the fiery furnace and God sent Donald Trump to protect us. Thank You, Lord, for giving us a President who truly cares about our nation and its people. Protect him and may everything he puts his hand to prosper. Even now, the Democrats stand fast in their wickedness. All liars go to Hell. They need to rethink what they are doing. When this is all said and done, God will triumph and we are his people so we will share in the glory. In the mighty Name of Jesus Christ, I submit this evil unto thee, my God. May Your glory and honor shine so bright. The blind cannot see and evil has only evil to protect it.

This fight with con man Don isn't about border security. It's about the symbolism of a wall as a metaphor for demonizing nonwhite immigrants and immigrants from [expletive] countries. It's about the final statement in the narrative to protect America from changing demographics.  "Make America Great Again" was never about great. It was about white.  No imminent threat from undocumented immigrants exists. Illegal immigration has been falling for the last two decades, and it was at its lowest in 2017. Half of illegal immigrants don't cross illegally but rather overstay a visa that was secured legally. Those who say illegal immigrants pose a threat to police and American citizens ‚Äî just another exaggeration. Studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a rate that is 85 percent less than native-born individuals.  #TRUMPSHUTDOWN!!!
Wait ass swipe your campaign promise said Mexico would pay that's the promise you made so forget it
Build a wall between USA and Canada too.  Canadians are being drained by illegal cross border immigrants coming from USA as well. Thank you!
We have literally been promised a border wall by spineless politicians for the last 30 years, and we're tired of being lied to by the government we fund. Get it done once and for all.
Build the wall, NO amnesty, STOP allowing them to enter,why do we need to provide 52K beds and medical treatment, these foreign invaders are bankrupting America. STOP ALL welfare to illegal aliens and refugees and make it retroactive, get them out.
Build the wall and secure our borders üòäüëçüèª
First evidence shows that the caravan moving north was initiated by social media spread by republicans to give Trump another reason for fear mongering before the midterm elections.
Build the wall and use the stroke of ink pen. It would of been nice if the Democrats would work together. They refuse to help
Americans have been BEGGING to seal that border since at least 1986 and both parties have FAILED.  Why do we even pay these people?? They completely destroy everything they get their filthy hands on and then try and.convince us they're doing us a big favor.  And democrats are the worst of them two evils by far. Their insane "sanctuary" policies are KILLING Americans and bleeding us dry financially.  Build the freaking wall and seal the border already.  Chuck and Nancy need to get the hell out of the way and let Americans get to work and get it done..
Build it and they won't come....Build that wall build it tall.
Build that wall and build it the way you want it . Screw them Dems and Libs .
Donald J. TrumpDonald you say you want the rapes to stop, yes, I agree ... but how is it any different when a white man does it and gets away with it? He is still walking free!!!!  But a Mexican does it and you say that's why a wall needs to go up???
Wait ass swipe your campaign promise said Mexico would pay that's the promise you made so forget it
The dumocrats are like selfish children, no I take tat back,  it's worse. They're committing treason against the U.S.
Shut the hell up, what about the KKK or the people right here in America, you are a disgrace using the wrong people for this wall!!!!!
America wants border security. AFTER YOU LEAVE YOU IDIOT !!

They act like Trump alone can stop the shutdown..What's wrong with them giving the money and putting people back to work.. They act like Americans are stupid... Pay for the wall and get people back to work OR you going to act like babies and act like it's only up to Trump.. When the truth is You two could stop the shutdown and put people back to work today.. Voters need to remember this and Vote you out of office

Stopping you from lying to the American public Stupid!!!  https://youtu.be/-yfIxBjOw3o
They know when you cut their voters from running the border......they are finished. You are just one step away from making the Communist Democrat party a prehistoric fossil. They will dry up like water on a hot 120 degree day when the flow stops. They know it!!
There is one way and one way only to get them back for all the hell they put this President through..
Donald you stupid smuck.  You haven't fulfilled your promises and villafying a specific race, lying, trying to win support while doing this just means you have sunk to an all time low.  No Wall.
Donald J. TrumpDonald you say you want the rapes to stop, yes, I agree ... but how is it any different when a white man does it and gets away with it? He is still walking free!!!!  But a Mexican does it and you say that's why a wall needs to go up???
Getting your batshit crazy ass out of the White House. Criminal incompetent fool.
We stand with you POTUS!!! Build the wall and expose these liars and evil deep state to the world!!  Lets do it!!
Yes Mr President our country need our walls to prevent tragedies to our children and women and against every America citizens. This has started by obama changing our immigration laws to allow immigrants to enter our country illegally and able to stay and get free everything. And over congress which didn‚Äôt stop him. Just like everything he has done for them and not for the citizens. And because they themselves said they was for security and protection at our border and have a wall to keep out immigrate but to deport those here as well. So have they. Not as much as they should have. Plus it is what democrats want to do for our border but refuse to just because of who is our President.
Protect the nation ‚Äî- build the wall and do all other measures to protect our country.  Spend our tax money on USA CITIZENS.
The only thing on the minds of the democrats is to get rid of the President and they will do anything and will not stop because they are afraid of him
Democrats are biggest idiotic threat to America
They are brainwashed by evilness Freeze freebies to ilegals. They will plea Pelosi n schummer for wall.
Democrats don‚Äôt want a wall because they love border crashers more than they love AMERICANS.  Democrats are evil. Protect illegal children while approve murdering legal American babies. 100% evil.
Do you people who are egging him on to build the wall, understand what you will lose if that money is directed there? You're all ignorant dimwits! Please understand the consequences of putting up 5 Billion Dollars for this ridiculous wall. Who do you think he's going to get to build it? Will he create a business of his own? So HE can profit. Or will he give it to one of his mates who will pay Trump a percentage, personally, just to gain the job? There's way more to this than what Trump is saying Factual Stats show immigration at the southern border is at its lowest. How can you just accept everything he says? He is a lying, criminal conman!
Donald you stupid smuck.  You haven't fulfilled your promises and villafying a specific race, lying, trying to win support while doing this just means you have sunk to an all time low.  No Wall.
I think every city should have check points for illegal immigrants along with the wall ...If democrats want to hinder the wall being built then start by showing the American people just how many illegal immigrants are already here
Build the walll...dont cave to lunatics

Your a lair !  4,000 terrorist turns into 12 suspected and only 6 at the southern border , the drugs come in cars and thru the 60 tunnels we have found , your wall is stupidity and nothing more !  That's why 62 percent of us know it and are opposing you !  And over 50 percent are calling for your impeachment so yes America wants you gone , not a wall , four walls around you called a jail cell !
JIM.  THE PRESIDENT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO PROTECT AMERICA AND CAN BUILD A WALL SON. GET COMFY ;)
THE WALL IS COMING!
We all know the Answer to this.. They would rather spend Billions to Murder Innocent Babies and Foriegn Countries then take care of thier own.. Build the Wall!!!
Has anyone thought of cutting the incentives for them to come here illegally? Asking for a friend.
Instead of shutting down government benefits, let's shut down illegal alien benefits!
You don't even realize it dummies bc your heads are so far up Trump's ass , but he's going to put this country in a recession. #TheGreatDepression2019.  #FuckTrump. #DontArgueWithMe
You are scum A small hand small dick Scum slum lord
Build it and move the liberals to Mexico
Build the Wall! Declare National Emergency!
Stopping you, are the Democrats #1 purpose.....of their stupidity...they need to pull there heads out of the sand.
THE WALL IS COMING!
You could have the cure for cancer or the solution to world peace and the Democrats will still try and stop you !
Many from the GOP as well, you troglodyte.
Your a damned lier! Take responsibility for your actions
Buddie americans dont want a stupid wall, they want livable wages, free health care, affordable education, etc . Thats what Americans want.
Build it over Congress approval, nothing will turn people against you more than if they cannot pay their bills , put food on their table , pay their rent... no matter how loyal they are ..because it is human nature and survival THEY'LL turn on you.... it's not that they will just blame the Democrats they will start to blame you.
Do not believe one word of what N. P. and C. S. say.  . If you open the government, They will tell you to take a flying leap.    Stick to your guns.  Why don‚Äôt they acknowledge that you are asking for 5.7 billion to build a Wall but it is costing 150 billion a year to support the illegals.   Even without counting the crime, drugs, diseases, terrorist, etc, that is coming across our southern border.    It‚Äôs a ‚ÄúNo Brainer‚Äù  for a reasonable thinking person. Why are they putting illegals needs over American citizens needs..  They took an Oath to uphold the Constitution of The United States of Americat but they seem to be violating that sacred Oath By not protecting and taking care of American citizens over illegals.
Build the wall. Keep pushing forward. USA!!
Arizona native here, and I am SICK of watching our communities turn into Mexico.  CLOSE THE BORDER! BUILD THE FUCKIN WALL!!!!
All the foolishness about a crisis that does not exist is to divert about the indictments that will include Chump and Chump Jr. Little Donny half scoop met with Russian agents during campaign. Collusion and obstruction is a real thing. You idiots can believe all the lies if you want. Chump knows his goose is cooked. REAL Americans will take back our country. All you traitors can stick with Chump .
Democrats  idea  of  border  security  is  no  security  at  all,  no  border,  welfare  for  these  leeches  and  massive  future  voter  fraud.  We  may  need  a  bloody  civil  war  to  fix  this.
Stopping you, are the Democrats #1 purpose.....of their stupidity...they need to pull there heads out of the sand.
This American looks forward to the day that justice prevails and your orange ass is in an orange jumpsuit.
Democrats stop being difficult...you are all a bunch of traders to America and Federal Government.  Shame on you.  I believe we the people are going need the vote to shut you down.  If you Democrat‚Äôs continue to leave our borders unlawfully open....all the terrible tragedies will hit in your families.  Don‚Äôt you love your own families?  Stop being stubborn like children.  Help your loved ones and America.  You Democrats are hiding information you don‚Äôt want leaked out to America or your families.
Obstructionist PIGS, give the American people what they want . . . BUILD THE WALL!
I bet a ton of money with my bookie that trump will lie 53 times in 8minutes. I need the money since the government is shut down. Come on trump don‚Äôt let me down you lying bag of üí©ü§û
The last 3 presidents started wars in other countries that created no benefit to the American people, and we paid for them.  Trump wants to actually do something for our country that would benefit the America people and half the country hates him for it. What a time to be alive in politics.
Mr President, I think you know the answer. Forgive those that are too stupid to recognize taking responsibility. They dont take responsibility, they toss it on others and try to shame them for it. THe American people are on your side!
Democrats  idea  of  border  security  is  no  security  at  all,  no  border,  welfare  for  these  leeches  and  massive  future  voter  fraud.  We  may  need  a  bloody  civil  war  to  fix  this.
Donald Trump is creating a political problem to win up coming election....... he just manufacture his own problem with lies , hate and deceit turning a brother against brother nations against nations manipulation they ignorant for political and selfish gain.....
You are an idiot! You said that the woman who said, "Impeach the Mother f'r" was sooo horrible. Seriously dude???? You also said that on national television. So dont go and diss someone for exactly what you did. It is hypocritical. You would think that a so called POTUS wouldnt say that on national television either !! Have some respect for yourself.
They all need to visit the border and walk along it for awhile - see the places where there is not much to keep the dangerous ones from just walking into the USA.  I think they're all too chicken to walk along the border - it's a dangerous place!
LIAR. No, law enforcement did NOT request 5.6B for a wall. NO, Dems did not ask for a wall and then change their minds when Trump was elected. NO, drugs do NOT flood over the border with illegals, and no wall will change that.
Exactly! What Is important to the Dems?? Aside from stomping around over every little thing you say and do, the asshats look completely freaking bananas and might I add, far removed from the reality that is the American People.
Build the wall üëçüôè keep pushing it. Or declare natural disaster and build anyway. Wonder how much cartel $ they getting to fight this üòâüëç
we have to get rid of these democrats...and at this point I don't care how it's done....
Build the wall!!!!! We need to secure our border. #maga
We can secure the border without a wall. Trump‚Äôs a disgrace! He needs to be impeached, then imprisoned!
Sorry but I feel that we need boarder control, and I don't care how we get it! wall or no wall we need to keep friends and family safe. i am all for people coming here and making a better life for themselves but for the love of god please do it the right way. so many are coming over here bringing illness and getting almost everything for free. how is that fair to those of us who are busting our asses everyday and still struggling to get by and get the help that we need.and for those saying that we don't need boarder control it's just wrong. it's as though you are saying that you approve of these illegals coming here and doing god knows what ever they want without any rules or punishment. and if any of you can come up with a better idea for boarder control other than a wall of some sort, do tell inquiring minds want to know, and by the way in order get boarder safety money has to be spent. nothing comes for free!! but here's and idea hows about thousands of contractors come together bring materials and tell Donald J. Trump were here to build your wall. oh but wait congress will say oh HELL NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!
Hold the LINE SIR! These Evil bad actors THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT ANYONES LIFE...Just look at what Pelosis district is criminal drug infested street scum ...she lines her Bank account with foreign aid funds ...AUDIT  Sure Schumers is a well..SOROS PENGUIN PUPPET!

This country is going to hell in a hand basket. People claim they don't see color, we're all one race or that "all lives matter" those are the same people that are all in for this wall. Do you know the type of stuff people have to do to smuggle drugs in this country? Every race steals, kills, and lies. Do I hate Trump? No, but I don't care for his vulgarity either. It's not his fault that people are falling for the okeydoke though. People should have a mind of their own. I'm neither Democrat or Republican, I'm a human being that has empathy and compassion for those who are suffering. A Mexican man (who was legal born and bred) told me the conditions living in Mexico, and they're barbaric. Of course people want to come to America, the supposed land of the free and home of the brave, the same way people wanted to escape from England and ended up here. How do we know that the Native Americans didn't have a law about illegals entering in their country?
We want border security and our tax dollars to stop paying for all these illegals who come here plop their babies out and expect us to pay for them, they were born while their parents committed a crime, they should be considered illegal as well. We are the ones forced to feed, educate and give til our own go without.
You deranged mofo  Its no reason to shutdown the government
Now Hawaii can make money off of Hawaiian grown marijuana and maybe we can open some new prisons.  Democrats have not given us, United States Citizens, Financial Security, so they are now offering Socialism.  I‚Äôm not following their parade
Pelosi and shummer are as big a threat as illegals crossing our boarders because they are domestic threats they need to be behind walls and bars. Drain the swamp
Hawaii Harbors Illegal immigrants!!!!!!  Then Hawaii asks the Federal money, that they separately need because of the Unions who hold Citizens of Hawaii hostage: State Workers Union, Stevadores Union, police Union, hotel workers union, stage workers and film workers union, who all make more than the Teachers Union.  Everyone wants to work for a Union for retirement.  And Union Heads want power.  Prices go up.  Hawaii residents have to pay the ship yard workers union in San Diego and again in Hawaii before they can go to the store for toilet paper.  So Hawaii‚Äôs Government asks the Federal government for money, ‚Äúbecause Hawaii is using its precious space for The Marines, Navy, Army and Airforce.‚Äù  Who suffers, the Tourists, Hawaii residents, and Hawaii‚Äôs Public School System is the worst.
SOMEONE PUT A MUZZLE ON THIS MENTALLY ILL NUT JOB.
Democrats want to secure the border -- as long as we're not wasting taxpayer money.    (1)  Most illegal immigrants are visa ‚Äúoverstayers" (Hire more personnel to track visa holders.  A wall won't help.)  (2) According to the DEA, almost all drugs come in through legal points of entry (invest in more agents and scanning technology.  A wall won't help.)  (3)  Private citizens own much of the land slated for the wall, and will lose farm and ranch land to government use of imminent domain.  (A wall is unfair to landowners.)  (4)  According to MIT engineers, the wall would cost $31.2 billion. Homeland Security estimates it at $22 billion.  But take those cost estimates and consider the following.  According to the Cato Institute a 700 mile border wall, which has been built, was estimated at $1.2B.  However, as is usually the case with public works projects, the price rose precipitously to final cost of $700B. That‚Äôs almost a 600% increase.  (What we know for a certainty is that the true cost of Trump‚Äôs wall is going to be far more than his puny estimate of $5B.  Are we going to stop the project once we‚Äôve spent $5B?  No.  Taxpayers will be on the hook for whatever the cost increase will be.)  What Democrats want is a 21st century solution to a 21st century problem.  Leave it to Trump to not think outside the box, and instead propose a 4th century solution.

Seems to me the people who don't want border security are the same people who should be on the other side of the wall. I see your dumb smiling faces. Let me ask you... what if your mother, sister, brother..etc was raped or killed by an illegal? Or for that matter overdosed on one of the many drugs coming from Mexico. Where would you stand then?
SOMEONE PUT A MUZZLE ON THIS MENTALLY ILL NUT JOB.
We overstand you don't have to be Smart to talk to your Ignorant Cult members. They'd rather have $5 Billion for a irrelevant Wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for, than $3 Billion for Health care. I wish 45 the "Pied Piper for Imbeciles" would cut Food Stamps and Welfare so the 60% of his cult members that receive them would starve to death.
Donald Trump Jr is tied to El Chapo's Mexican drug cartel. These photos prove it. The same Latvian banker Don Jr is in photos with also was behind a massive Russian money laundering scheme as well. Because, of course he was.   https://thesternfacts.com/trump-jr-now-tied-to-mexican-drug-cartels-money-laundering-scheme-5906b8d4ce5d
Democrats say drugs are all being stopped at the border crossing.  Just shows how dumb they really are.
Drugs seized at THE PORT not BORDER. #NoWall   End #TrumpShutDown   https://6abc.com/$17-million-worth-of-fentanyl-seized-at-port-of-philadelphia/3690305/
With all the monies that have been giving to the Bushes, Clintons, Obummer all these years for border security and I'm not talking about 5b we're talking about 100's of billions, why are we having this problem? Answer...it's used to do what they said it was going to be used for, but they give it to companies  they have intrest in and get kick backs from it, ( you know like give the contracts to family members) It's away to keep these billions of dollars going. Now they know that there is someone who will use every penny to fix this problem. And no need for all these bilions every year. That and a loss of illigal votes
Build the wall! Get rid of those who say no! Wish it worked that way anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Screw these filthy Democrats ... cancer of this country, the filthy pigs!!!
Build that Wall.  Taxpayers can‚Äôt finance the world's uneducated people, taking hard-earned $$ from our families.  We're angry & fed-up with globalists expecting us to educate & give free medical care to the world‚Äôs population while our children suffer here in America.   Globalists/socialists should not be making laws & decisions for American citizens.
I can tell you. You would blame Trump! Probably because the wall wasn't built fast enough!
It's so easy for those who don't live on the border to not want a wall, to say we dont need it. They dont live on the border they dont have to deal with drug smugglers, rapists or human traffickers breaking into their homes. If you dont want a wall a DARE YOU to move to the border and leave your doors open!!! I guarantee you'll be singing a different tune in just a short few days. You dont care for american citizens safety then you're not an american!!!  Daddy president put the crying tantrum toddlers in a corner and now they're pissed of about it. Libtards Sucked on Obamas tits for too long and got coddled!!!
just listen 2 silly Nancy , now that other idiot , don't know his name , just a idiot , wot a tool , stand firm Donnie , good move against the EU yesterday thanks !
Your Promise was for Mexico to pay for the Wall, your a liar.
Fulfill your promise that Mexico will pay for your stupid wall!
No, Americans don‚Äôt. Just idiots who buy your bullshit
Chump your such a liar.   https://news.gallup.com/poll/235775/americans-oppose-border-walls-favor-dealing-daca.aspx
Being a trump supporter must be a lot like being an abused woman in an abusive relationship, no matter how many times you get punched in the face all the I'm sorry's and I love you's make it ok, it must be a psychological reaction to not being able to let go of it, trump supporters feel committed at this point because you all voted for him, fought for him, argued for him, and now you see what a failure he is being president, being a human being, being a descent person and caring when he doesn't, yeah trump supporters, YOU ARE the beaten woman in the relationship, and trump is is the abuser who says sorry it will never happen again!! and you just stay with him again and again and again...
Build the wall. the  Let migrants apply legally and not trec miles through dangerous   terrain.

Marilyn Weingartner Legal vs illegal big difference .

Micheal Marceaux. SEEKING ASYLUM IS A LEGAL RIGHT. SEEKING ASYLUM IS A LEGAL RIGHT. SEEKING ASYLUM IS A LEGAL RIGHT. SEEKING ASYLUM IS A LEGAL RIGHT. SEEKING ASYLUM IS A LEGAL RIGHT. SEEKING ASYLUM IS A LEGAL RIGHT. SEEKING ASYLUM IS A LEGAL RIGHT. SEEKING ASYLUM IS A LEGAL RIGHT.
That was really ignorant Marilyn Weiner..  Why do we need sanctuary cities for illegals if we're all supposed to be so safe.??  This is our country not theirs..  I have rights also..

Next send all ‚Äòrefugees‚Äô back to their home where they can elect and give Pelosi citizenship in their country to be President and steal their tax dollars.
Ok we are down with border security ..............but.........your wall is fucking dumb.
Americans should be happy. In canada our dumbass leader has turned the country into a jesus homeless shelter. We're taking everyone in and paying them to come here. Its astounding how it's even happening.
Does anyone ever check out the stats on the likes, angry, funny, sad etc.... on these posts. Maybe all the liberals should get a clue. Americans do want the wall and immigration reform. We simply cannot sustain this country with this many immigrants pouring in and costing american's all sorts of funds. We have our own citizens living on the streets, children going to bed hungry, and drugs. Don't need more coming here for us to deal with. DO IT LEGALLY!
Build the wall declare a National emergancy
Ignore Pelosi and the nittwitts.... BUILD THE WALL!  We see how she stands for the red, white and blue by her actions against our veterans just this past week.  She‚Äôs trash....worthless. Can‚Äôt stand her.
I want the wall .  You know why? So many of us latinos come over here to escape the craziness of our home countries. Why do we want that same craziness infiltrating America? You gotta be a special kind of stupid or you must really hate America with a passion and want it to fall.
Your promise was that Mexico would pay for the wall. How are democrats stopping that? Fuckwit

Build the wall!  They had 25 years and did nothing.
Hey! You actually said something with some truth in it!!! Americans do want border security! That's what Democrats are standing up for! They want methods that are more likely to be effective than your huge wall. They are willing to continue talks about border security - which don't have to include a government shutdown. They had agreed to a funding package that included money for wall repair and some building, where applicable, but you refused to budge unless they totally capitulated to your demands for funding your wall. Way to show you care about our people - not!  Democrats are quite willing to work on improving border security. They also want legal immigration, rather than illegal immigration. But calling anyone coming to our borders "illegals" is not right. They are only "Illegals" if they try to avoid the vetting process. There is a lot of work needed to improve the immigration situation, but your stubborn insistence upon doing it only your way will get nowhere fast.
If you believe this bullcrap, then tell please tell PeterPan and the Easter bunny, hello....geez....do you have walls around your house???
Your promise was that Mexico would pay for the wall. How are democrats stopping that? Fuckwit
Why is Chuck Schumer always with evil Pelosi ??! Both evil
trump is a fear monger!  trump must be impeach immediately, so that America can recover from trump's destructive actions!
Dont  give  in  to  their  bullshit.  My  lights  are  on,  trash  was  picked  up,  water  still  running.  Keep  it  shut  down  till  congress  funds  the  wall.
Oh go on build the wall, it'll keep all you Trump-loving idiots in üòÇüêê
Build the wall. Don't wait on the Democrats. Bill every adult $150, even illegal immigrants working here. Then reimburse legal citizens the $150 after we are in a National State of Emergency.
build wall with armed guards to shoot
Build the wall then put the Democrats on the other side since the love the illegals so much
If you believe this bullcrap, then tell please tell PeterPan and the Easter bunny, hello....geez....do you have walls around your house???
Let the man do his damn job the American people voted this man in and he kept every promise he made! Build the wall keep out the heroin influx, illegal people we know nothing about, murders, etc.
Why can't we Send those who have to do Court ordered community Service work or who are incarcerated and in the overcrowed prisions that taxpayers are paying for to clean up the trash in the National parks.  They get paid 3 square meals a day, a bed, a roof over their head, libraries, gyms, tvs and game rooms...  There is No reason they shouldn't be put immediatly on a guarded clean up detail.  They can re pay with Civil Service duties. Put the tracker ankle bracelets & wrist bands on  them while being watched with armed guards and put them in tgere to do clean up work.  However ... It's a shame people cant take a trash bag in on their own or are so lazy and not more considerate to pick up after themselves to begin with.
If everyone else put this country first and quit obstructing, we‚Äôd all be doing a whole lot better. People that are so jealous of the rich keep shooting themselves in the feet trying to raise taxes on their own employers. Put your extended hand back in your own pockets, go to work, and pay for what you want! Fake News and Fake Humanitarianism is the enemy of this country!
The democrats are  disgraceful and hypocrites. They all wanted the wall, they got money ey for a wall that was never built, 46 billion to be exact where did that money go? Is that why they are multi millionaires on a 174 k a year job? People need to open their eyes about the democrats. They care nothing for the people. Their hatred is fueled by Satan because God is love . Support the democrats and you‚Äôre supporting Satan
You promised your supporters and all amaricans that Mexico is paying for the wall yet now you shutdown the government over paying for the wall. Typical Trump lies coming to the surface.

Build the wall. The laborers tax withholdings is around 30% and taxes paid by other workers and materials add lot's more to the government coffers so really the wall pays for itself and saves untold amounts of welfare. BUILD the WALL now.

Kimberley Gray  so if this was Obama asking for funding for a wall, would you still be against it?
Yes, just like I was against Obama's high level of deportations and his use of drones.
I have also written several nasty letters to my very liberal senators regarding thier support of Israel.
I am sorry that I didn't make your point for you.
trump is a little whinny lying bitch
we have 20 to 30 million illegals in OUR country now. How many will be enough for you 100 million? The Democrats will be happy when the USA has collapsed and they can start their Marxist country.
We want border safety. Build the wall!!! Democrats you really know how to make yourselves look stupid!!!!! üò† üò†
Build the wall Stay shutdown until they fully fund the wall
Build the wall protect america
I suggest someone raid Pelosi's vineyards.. You'd find lots of undocumented immigrants there

Actual American here. WE DO NOT WANT THE WALL.   There‚Äôs thousands of things that 5 billion could be better spend on then a half ass wall.   Also, why are there so many Non-Americans saying ‚ÄúBest President Ever?‚Äù...... Trumps vocal fan base is a bunch of fake accounts. Trump‚Äôs cabinet is guilty.   Real Americans value human life. This isn‚Äôt Russia
Eric E. Murdaa umm yes we do ...(actual american)
Matt Smith Did you know that almost ALL illegals get here via Airplane? Literally NONE get through the southern border.
DO NOT GIVE IN TRUMP, FIGHT THESE STUPID DEMOCRATS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE WITH YOU BUILD THE WALL
They want to stop You My President. You and Your Administration has outed them and they are feeling how naked they really are. I stand with You! Your not alone. Stand Strong! Pelosi & Schumer look like fools. They like their time in front of a camera. They talk the talk but can‚Äôt walk the walk. I can‚Äôt wait till they are all on the debate stage. The Garbage they spew and blame others for what they themselves are guilty of.
You should get Chucky and Nancy to accompany you on your border trip, and maybe get a first-hand idea about what is needed, from the people working the front lines every single day. Last set of interviews I heard, every border official said the wall would help IMMENSELY. Of course, I might be foolishly optimistic that these two clowns would pay any attention to people that are actually working the problem. I can dream, right?
All you Trump supporter believe everything that Assclown tall you if you all was so freaking bloody Smart you would Fact check everything
Your promise is about as good as your marriage vows. What happened to Mexico will pay for the wall, I promise. Your an ASSHAT.
Too many clowns responding.  Hello dumbasses, we have thousands entering ILLEGALLY.
You don‚Äôt have to build a wall to secure the borders you fucking dumb prick!
Stand your ground, Mr President. The American people are behind you. We need the wall. More and more of these caravans will be coming. We need to put a stop to unwanted illegals getting into our country bringing drugs, human trafficking and disease into our country.
Half these posts aren‚Äôt Americans at all but Russian bots üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ fake ass Americans!
Matt Smith Did you know that almost ALL illegals get here via Airplane? Literally NONE get through the southern border.
Half these posts aren‚Äôt Americans at all but Russian bots üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ fake ass Americans!
You got the first part right, Cheeto. Stopping your incompetent, traitorous ass from hurting this country any further should be priority number one!
Oh, ouch, what a cutting reply, Mikey! Just what I'd expect from a highly intelligent tRumpie, though!
Steve Pecenka Its my way of cursing you out without getting banned . So yeah I am pretty intelligent lol. Its fun and therapeutic at the same time . We all know yall got üêímonkey brains I give out üçå
Micheal Marceaux LOL-Sure Mike. Having to use emojis to express your deep thoughts is a sure sign of intellect.I'll bet you're every bit as smart as the orange buffoon in the oval office. You know, the idiot who claims every word, every stupid action, is the biggest, the best, in the history of the world. Only a lying, insecure, narcissistic stable genius  feels the need to constantly proclaim what a genius he is. So yes, you're pretty intelligent using the tRumpie yardstick.

Border security yes...your asshole wall to please the Trumpkin Bumpkins, Looney Limbaugh, Transvestite Coulter, Hack Hannity, Loopy Levin, Crackpot Carlson, Ichabod Ingraham, and the rest of the Fox Fake News CLOWNS...:No way Stumpy!
Build it then close the border till Mexico pays up!

Become a Us citizen and that means in all ways Honor our nation and our flag learn to speak english. Work and pay taxes like I do.obey the laws of our Great Land. They adapt to our nation not us,to there ways. Yes serve in our militaryif of age to do so.
not going to happen you moron -  go and pay gold instead and leave running of the country to any one else.
Steve Pecenka you were the one being a condescending little prick talking about my intelligence. I reversed it and merely explained why I do the symbols lol .
What's most important to Americans is stopping you from screwing us out of our tax dollars to build your stupid f'king wall so you can repay your debt to Russia by way of "US Steel" provided by Evras North America, whose parent company is Evras and 31% owned by Russian billionaire, Trump family friend and close Putin ally, Roman Abromavich. No doubt, also, your motivation to place tariffs on steel from outside North America.  YOU SUCK!
You have conflated ‚Äúborder security‚Äù with a wall that won‚Äôt work, you incompetent buffoon. Resign and play some golf before your prison sentence.
Border! Term limits for these idiots.
Americans want their fucking paychecks clown
Declare a national emergency president.. we stand firm with you. We know that anyone with common sense knows we need a secure border. The Democrats are the ones causing the shutdown.  They just gave millions  to Europe for abortions but zero for safety for Americans safety.  All country's need secure borders ,just as we need protection and safety in our own homes  we need the wall   Build the WALL.
BUILD THE DAMN WALL! It's OUR money, OUR country and OUR wall!
We need the wall in Somalia please come and build
The Democrats don‚Äôt care about the American people they care about their pockets and that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs it they don‚Äôt care whether we live or die you Mr. President care and that concerns them get in there and get the job done we got a boost these Democrats out of office
Basically,  anything to stab you in the back sir. That's what the Democrats will do.
Time to hold the Democrats accountable. Americans first. They need to be cornered by pissed off Patriots and citizens now. They should prioritize citizens over illegal immigrants.

We all want security but the wall isn't going to fix anything. This isn't the Ming Dynasty. We don't have hordes of Mongols pillaging our towns. It didn't work then or now.
The Israel wall has been very effective at keeping bad people out.
Edward Dennis Toppe Israel is incredibly smaller than the United States not to mention that wall and Israel is really apples to oranges.  The people coming to America are seeking a better life and running away from violence low wages and poverty. There is no way in the world that there is not a better option.

Your just as IGNORANT as you look.
Oh really. Look at France and England. They are being killed by all of the illegal immigrants who invaded their country. Walls work! Build the wall!

Last year in the U.S. over 12,000 people were shot and killed by American citizens and Trump fights tooth and nail to prevent any common sense gun control. About a half dozen people are killed by undocumented aliens and Trump demands that we spend billions of dollars building a wall. I guess he doesn't think that it matters if your child is killed by a fellow American....I guess he thinks you will only mourn for them if they are killed by an undocumented person.
Linda Lynch build that wall!!!!!!

Linda Lynch you know that isn't the only issue. If an American commits murder, they are prosecuted and laws are put in place. Your point is silly.

Your just as IGNORANT as you look.
Trump is a dumb ass. He clawing for what $5 billion dollars for a wall. A bipartisan bill was presented to him last year with $25 billion for the wall. This in exchange for DACA. Trump rejected it. Trump is an idiot savant. Even if I had voted for this jerk I would feel the same way.
Everyone should start flooding all Democrats in Washington to BUILD THE WALL.  Calls, emails, faxes whatever!
Oh Mr.President they rather see you fail then coming together and helping our Country.If you fixed everything and made it great again.They wouldnt know what to do with themselves....IDIOTS!!
You have already broken your "promise." Mexico will not pay for this wall, fence, or barrier. And now you think it's A-OK to saddle Americans with this foolish thing. It will not be a wall in tribute to you, you egocentric idiot.
Build the wall now before more Americans get killed by the illegals

Damn mainstream media ...sick of them lieing.....and screw Schumer and Pelosi ....lieing bitches
Don't use my tax money to build no damn wall. You said in your campaign that Mexico was going to pay for the wall now your saying the wall will pay for itself through a trade deal. I don't care of you are a Republican or a Democrat This man has shut down the government and people are unable to pay mortgages and provide food for their children and you have the nerve to talk about all the killings of women and children. During your campaign you didn't give a rats ass about women or children. Jesus fight this battle because it is yours I'm just disgusted and sick to my stupid because he has the never to talk am humanity
You are JUST A LIAR!! You‚Äôve never kept a promise in your life. Why? You can careless for anyone of us!
It doesn‚Äôt matter what you want for our country the Democrats will not agree with you.  You have done more for us in a long time. The democrats are so stupid and only care about themselves and not what is best for our country.   #prayforourpeesident
Thank you President Trump. The answer is obvious and many sound-minded citizens know the answer. GOD HELP those who can only insult and obstruct. Here's a bible verse: see if it resonates with anyone and can show a minute ability to abstain from vulgarity. I probably don't want your opinion anyway. Jesus said, "Satan has come to only steal, kill, and destroy." You don't have to be a genius to see that one side is BUILDING and the other just intends to DESTROY and do everything harmful. My peace comes from knowing that GOD knows. Drunken, idiotic words and behavior do not escape him. The people have done nothing but harm our government MUST repent and turn from their wicked ways instead of taking a BIG FAT PAYCHECK for doing harm. Many don't like that their tax payer-money is going to drunken fools who hate God and people. So, dear President, TAKE HEART, because no vulgar language will stop our prayers or make God LESS than GOD. Every person is a "vapor, a mist." Jesus said you don't know if you one more hour on earth. Take His wise words, obstructionists, and REPENT. He will forgive and replace your heart of stone with one that is soft toward him and others. It's a better deal than what the Dems. have going. TAKE IT.
Take the Dems out to the trash and get these Muslims out of govt office
yes yes yes still think  middle of night load a cargo plane full of money and land it in the desert  have contractors thier  give them it tax free to bulid the wall..  better then what Obaxxx did  and they didnt say anything PROBEN SOLVED
You are a idiot, all candidates make so called promises -but cannot get them approved.  We are a Democracy not Russia.
The democrats are more concerned with stoping the president responsibility's and campaign promises than they are American's safety!!!! Democrats are making themselves look really bad and foolish!!! It cost the US more per year to take care of all these illegals than to build the wall........think about it!!!! Just build the wall and save money and lifes at the same time!!!!!!!!!

Stupid wall idea! Open the government you big ass child
build the wall !!!!!!!!! I'm so sick of hearing people say that there is no crisis on our borders. there sure as hell is. if you don't think so then take some of the people coming over and let them live in your house.
Piss on Shitmer(Schumer). Keep it shut down. We support you Mr. President!!!
we have to now worry about canada boarders too that fool up there is letting everyone in too. travel ban on America safety first. how soon those celb snowflakes forget 911.
this brain dead jackass is blowing gas over his address while americans are suffering
The democrats and most of the republicans want America destroyed. They want this country to be communist.
Let's see what the ratio of smart/morons are in this country. Let's hope we can outvote the morons who want FREE STUFF and are clueless as to WHO PAYS FOR IT. Those who want SOCIALISM don't want the wall.  Those who want SOVEREIGNTY (a free country) WANT THE WALL.  All you people who want socialism why don't you just pack your bags, get the hell out and leave the rest of us patriots alone. You socialists ARE A DISGRACE TO OUR COUNTRY AND EVERYTHING IT STANDS FOR. Now... GET OUT!!! Go find a country that share YOUR values!!!!
Yes we want borders secured..Democrats need to vote for this..or get voted out of office.!
Let Pelosi and Schumer stand guard on the border for a month like our Americans do and see how fast they would agree or maybe they should meet the parents, spouses that have lost their loved ones due to illegal aliens. As part of this nation we want to feel safe in our own country....and we do not....fix the problem Pelosi and Schumer...and don't blame the President for this, this is your fault so stop blaming our President.  How can you say your part of this country when you won't help the rest of us Americans feel safe maybe it's YOU who wants recognition because you don't like our President.  He is not the puppet you all are used too, so get off your high paying butt and really do something for us who love our country!!!
ok ur stupid as that jackass of a moron
Build the wall, give Daca kids a path to citizenship, establish a program for all current illegals to obtain citizenship by paying a fee, requirement to take a constitution class and English classes, and a path to make them tax paying and off government free programs within a time period or deport them!
Ashamed of this immoral Congress!  They are ignoring the core value of the Constitution to serve and protect the citizens by valuing illegal immigrants over the welfare and safety over its own citizens
I thought you said Mexico was paying for the wall? Stop holding hard working Americans hostage for your personal gain...treasonous bastard! And, when did you idiots get conned into believing we needed a wall? Pathetic followers.
Build that wall!  Fix those horrible immigration laws!
Build the wall, keep our borders secure!
Build the wall. Don't let them win or America will lose.
Nancy and Chuck are rebellious, anti-American, pathetic excuses for 'Leaders' when they refuse to 'offer solutions' to this situation...OH Thats' right, they can't think on their own and are not creative enough to come up with anything....did I mention brainless. I hate how they are anti American and we pay them! They are to serve and protect, not abuse and accuse, and its immoral to support Illegal activities and Illegal people. Thir JOB is to serve and protect Americans!! Treasonous!
BUILD THAT WALL.  If the Democrats want to push you, they better wake up out of their dream. You've got the rest of us standing behind you.
Schumer & Pelosi lying... as usual...misrepresenting the entire issue!!! Their deceits are being seen...their once sheep are starting to turn in to wolves hungry for retribution to being lied to and deceived for so long by these globalists socialist commies!   My response: Mr. President...DO NOT END THE SHUTDOWN UNTIL YOU GET THAT WALL!!! They all SAID they supported it when it got them votes...hold these liars to their words now!
The border isn't the issue you orange turd.

Just find the 50 Billion dollars they were suppose to already have allocated then use that. Maybe Schumer and Pelosi pocketed some to build walls around their property. Investigate how they both became rich on their salary. Start taking money back from all of them for misuse of funds. I am sure they will help fund the wall then.
Just do it.  Sick of all this political positioning, wasted time and money.  GET IT DONE!  It's time to stand and protect our country and citizens.
Well USA is being plundered, and the fatality of legal persons is a devastating issue! As if WE Vets, and American born for generations...have no rights!  On a footnote, its very personal when one of your blood is drugged, raped in a horrible beating..violent enough to remove memory, physical  assault on entire body, robbed, left in a ditch like in a Biblical chapter. Barely lived, never the same. 4,000 in '16, '17 never talked again.  They had to be buried. 4,000 Americans unaccounted for, and not suspected of being indigent! The pirates are here by the tens of thousands of all nationalities and causes.
Dem-rats are worried that TRUMP will be the one that builds the wall! They want it...but they don't want his name attached to it. What a great achievement for the president to pull this off. History baby!
Build the wall that's all what matter.
Build the wall and enforce the laws!
I hope you will be able to clean DC.. Hoping you have all the evidence to make them all go to jail!!
Feds want paid you fucking blonde turd
Take the illegal immigrants challenge tonight and leave your doors unlocked while you sleep üòâ   I bet you won‚Äôt!!!
The border isn't the issue you orange turd.
It was a stupid, narcissistic promise with no basis in fact.
Maybe get mexico to pay for it and stop being a crybaby bitch?After all,that was the promise,was it not?
Your job as president is to boost our ecconmy a wall would put us in a recession. Meanwhile China is trying declare war on us while your trying to separate us from our neighbors downsouth with the border wall money you can spend on our military defense to keep us safe from an imment attack from the Chinese government instead of making America a luxurious country which would be spoiled by mistreatment on one another as Americans.
IMPEACH TRUMP!!! TRUMP FOR PRISON!!! REPORT FAKE NAMES AND PROFILES!!! Eradicate the trolls!!!
Build that wall. It doesn't matter where the money comes from. We do not need or respect the democratic party. They have proved to be worthless.
To the democrats every illegal is a family looking for a better life, to the republicans it's a gang banger whose been deported 3 times before, or an ISIS terrorist in disguise. Truth is its both, good people and bad people. But we cannot help the good people until stop the bad people with a wall and make everyone go through at least as much security as at an airport.
Do what you have to do. Build the wall! They are arrogant assholes who waste billions of dollars on ridiculous crap every year! They don't care about anything but their own agenda not the people of this country. Build the wall üá∫üá∏ Thank you for caring about us üíú
Democrats don‚Äôt care if anyone one dies. They love violence and crave corruption.  They steel all our money and give it to illegals and keep the rest for themselves.
You are an ignorant, useless human being.  I hope you die soon.  Very soon.
Take the illegal immigrants challenge tonight and leave your doors unlocked while you sleep üòâ   I bet you won‚Äôt!!!
You are an ignorant, useless human being.  I hope you die soon.  Very soon.
I want the border secure.  I live in Texas and I can‚Äôt tell you several times  I hired someone with a Social Security number that turned  out to be fake when I filed it with Social Security. I never knowingly hired anyone who was illegal. That means that I paid someone $20 an hour for 40 hours a week and they did not pay any income taxes because they lied.   If you‚Äôre an illegal alien you cannot pay income tax because you do not have a Social Security number. Think about that Americans.
Karen Ann Bradshaw aren't taxes withheld from gross pay?
Maureen Gallagher Kawa - you‚Äôd have to ask my CPA.
Just put the military on the job put small bases every 40 miles
Make it where only US citizens can vote and the Democrats won‚Äôt give a rats tail about immigration.
Stopping you, because Democrats are idiots
So at this points the loves + likes = 14,086  laughs are 274.  Hmmmm
Democratic did not say we was going to pull up the wall you said come on trunk stop playing without money I got a building to manage be honest I rather deal with the Bush family you're the worst president I ever had in my life
Trump please don‚Äôt do this. We know you rich as hell but WE NOT. Everybody don‚Äôt have millions billions and trillions you shutting the govt down messing w ppl money is ridiculous those Mexicans going to find a way to do wadever they gonna do regardless of a WALL! A wall trump ?! A damn wall bro ? 5billion dollar wall ughhhhhhhhhh you really pissing the Americans off
A clean bipartisan bill was before you, ask Lil‚Äô bitch McConnell where it is.
Stopping you.. Democrats are evil ! Stay strong in this trump !
YES, President Donald J. Trump. Americans want border security. You hear us clearly. BUILD THAT WALL. KEEP STANDING STRONG FOR THE PEOPLE. The Democrats couldn't stand to see you fulfill another one of your promises. You are showing them how a President ought to work for his country, his people and his God. If they had any true morals they would feel the shame. They are here for only their political games,  power and control and you shined the light on their darkness for those who wouldn't believe it. That's why they hate you so much. The light you shined on them showed more of who they truly are. PURE SELFISH EVIL. You busted them and now they are so angry.  We THE PEOPLE are ever so grateful for you. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
Maureen Gallagher Kawa - you‚Äôd have to ask my CPA.
Open Borders an easy way to attack America with bio-agents . CDC have identified anthrax as one of a few biological agents capable of causing death and disease in sufficient numbers to cripple a developed region or urban setting.
Don't give up Mr. President! Perhaps you should send Chuck and Nancy to one of the more active areas along the border for a while and then see if they feel the same way. We need this wall.
Americans do want border security! What we don‚Äôt want is those 2 morons in charge holding up the funds. There acting like  pissed off jealous children.  Enough !!!
2022243121 This is the # to contact your representative ... demand funding for border security now!!! SHARE SHARE SHARE
Is it time for dumbass to start lying and blaming yet?
We need this wall built...enough of illegal immigrants entering this country for how many years now?
Democrats have pure evil hate for Trump and America. Their choice is greed and power. Americans are becoming more aware. Less freebies to illegals will build the wall period.
Democrats don‚Äôt care how many people are killed by illegals. They don‚Äôt want him to fix this country...
BUILD THE WALL!!! ARREST THE DEEP STATE COMMUNISTS!!!
Yes we do! Build the Wall !!! In the meantime redirect all illegals to Schumer's and plus he's house. They can provide the room and board for them and then figure out how to get them out

Steve Calvin get them on assistance and they are gov owned! Dems count on this...it is a form of control.
BUILD THE WALL!!! ARREST THE DEEP STATE COMMUNISTS!!!
You just need to start blasting out little videos where all these dems have said they are for border security.  Call them out on their hypocrisy.  I bet they fold instantly.
Build the the wall Trump keep us safe,piss on That Bitch Pelosi!!!
They already made illegal x on they birth certificates now all they gotta do is cross the border it's a set up Build that wall by any means..
Shut it down.  Government spending is out of control.  I‚Äôd rather spend money on a wall then to support illegal immigrants pouring into our country
Yeah but a working government will suffice
Lost another irrational fb yesterday over this issue.  She called the President the ‚Äúliar in chief‚Äù and accused me of having a ‚Äúhateful heart‚Äù when I said that an illegal Dominican drug lord who lives in my hometown in RI, and has been arrested multiple times, should be deported.  üôÑ  Unfriended her! Why are people lacking common sense?  The wall isn‚Äôt going to solve all the problems if states (like RI and MA) refuse to send illegals that are arrested to ICE for deportation.
Nancy Pelosi has a wall around her house, yet she doesn‚Äôt want a wall to protect the American people. Chuck Schumer locks the doors to his home and office, but doesn‚Äôt want a wall and Ports of Entry to protect the American people. The Democrats not only want to give billions to other countries, but they want to give $12 Billion MORE this year, which they seemed to find the funds for, yet they refuse to allocate less than half that amount to protect the American people. The Democrats voted for a wall and tougher border security for President Obama, but refuse to support border security under President Trump. Schumer is mad because he claims President Trump hasn‚Äôt given him any words on how the money is spent, but was perfectly fine with passing Obamacare without reading the Bill. Democrats hate President Trump, and they hate everyone who voted for him. And they are willing to make all of us pay for that.
Call a national emergency and bypass the idiots.
Amen üôèüèº we will get our wall weather you like it or not.Democrat leaders hate God.Republican want what God wants.We love babies and would never kill them like the Democrats.Who do you think God will help.Baby killers or People who want Gods word to rule our land.The wall is only about keeping our country safe for our people.And anyone can come here If they obey the law and come in by the rules.We are all made and loved‚ô•Ô∏èby Godüá∫üá∏
Steve Calvin get them on assistance and they are gov owned! Dems count on this...it is a form of control.
You are a national disgrace and a global embarrassment.  You are also a fraud and a pathological liar.  Do go to jail soon. üëãüá∫üá∏ #MAGA
Trump rocks! Nancy and Schumer are idiots.
They want to stop you, but please keep doing what the American people voted you into office to do!!! Many people pray for you daily and for the protection you need from the maniacs on the 'other side'.....
Build the wall and at the same time focus on true reform.  It shouldn't take a person years and thousands of dollars to legally immigrate.    Make it easier to immigrate while at the same time eliminate ANY access to welfare benefits which should be for citizens only.  Build the Wall,  Thank you for finally being the President who will do what is right to protect the border and put principle, values above the needs of a political party.
The Democrats are being ASSHOLES. The American people want the wall, but they won't give an inch. Just to make Trump look bad. I hope there's a landslide victory for Trump in 2020.
Buy commercials giving arrest stats, educate voters on dangers. Dems don‚Äôt care, only want illegals to vote
Build  the  wall.    Control  who  enters  our  country.
Get back to work. You're not accomplishing anything except hurting your own people.  ...idiot
Amen üôèüèº we will get our wall weather you like it or not.Democrat leaders hate God.Republican want what God wants.We love babies and would never kill them like the Democrats.Who do you think God will help.Baby killers or People who want Gods word to rule our land.The wall is only about keeping our country safe for our people.And anyone can come here If they obey the law and come in by the rules.We are all made and loved‚ô•Ô∏èby Godüá∫üá∏
F*cking appalling!!! Words do not express the hope I have that these assholes feel the worst pain imaginable as they burn in hell for eternity.   Thank you Mr. President Trump and all who support the defense and security of this country.
They‚Äôre stopping you from showing your tax returns!? SOB‚Äôs P.S. ‚ÄúOr else I‚Äôll shut it down‚Äù is not ‚Äúworking together‚Äù.
Build the wall, steel barrier!
they are so full of hate for you that they see nothing good in what you are trying to achieve for the Americans.   I for one do not favor illegal aliens taking over our country.   If they want to join in the legal fashion then fine but otherwise get your scrawny ass out of here!!!!
Yeah he promised Mexico would pay for the wall the lieing SOB.
Build that wall and take the pay of Congress as well as the little guys
They are demons. Thank u I wish you could fire there asses
The dumbocrats are the ones to blame for government workers not getting paid. Pull your heads out of your ass and give this man our president the money he needs to protect our country by building that wall. What's its gonna take?!?!? Your mother, sister, daughter, son, father...the list goes on of people that we love that we can lose or be harmed by these people you're protecting and accepting into our country. Not to mention the expense that we have to undergo when they come in.
They are demons. Thank u I wish you could fire there asses
Turn that border into a canal! Dig it deep enough that the sides become a natural wall. Then the US and Mexico get trade growth from the canal being used, and we get a deterrent to illegal border crossings!
Jason Jones  a canal in a drought desert area????
Canals need water, right?
Peggy-Lynn Reeves A good portion has the Rio Grande, not desert area. It‚Äôs feasible, look at the Suez Canal.
Why do illegals think it is the American taxpayers responsibility to make their dreams come true.  We should take the hundred and50 billion $ a year we spend on illegals and put it into our infrastructure our teachers and everything else that is already here
Will you PLEASE STOP JERKING Around and just CLOSE The F&&ing BORDER!!!!!!
Your promise was to have Mexico pay for your stupid wall not us Americans Fucktard! Don't sweep that HUGE detail under the rug about your so called promise

The biggest threat to security is him. By shutting down the government he has caused the TSA to become weaker which means threats can come via  airports. Food stamps which people depend on are not getting them which will result in a increase of crime because people get desperate. federal workers are not being payed not knowing what or if they will get paid. If you support trump you have no compassion or foresight to see who your ignorance is effecting. You do realize your country is in trillions of dollars of debt and he wants to spend what you don't have. His grandmother was an illegal immigrant the same thing you say was said to his own family members.
We will not build Donald Trump's fucking white supremacist wall.
Drag them POS dems to the boarder in the middle of no where and leave them over night
I Am Sick And Tired of Pelosi And The Bunch üò† Fire them All and lets get people in there that supports and works with our president not against.

They have set comfortable for too long now getting a good paycheck and if they cannot put the citizens best interest at heart first then they need to be let go.. Bye-Bye ‚úã

Trash speech from a trash president
I'm in Mexico right now. Every h ilme here has a wall around it, a fence around it and razor wire all along the rop. So if the Mexican families need this ro be safe, then why should we ler MS13 run freely into the U.S.? The democrats say only 6 terrorists caught at the norder. Guess what it only takes ONE TERRORIST to cause a mass casualty!!!
BUILD THE WALL!!! Sir you have a phone and a pen just like Obama did!
Bomb Mexico NOW before they attack !!!
Whatever rump, you started this asshole. It's all on you. You said you would take the blame, but of course you folded, you ass!
Build a wall and legalize recreational pot. That‚Äôs how you win in 2020. MAGA
Walls keep prisoners in jail wall can keep asshole out
Stop belittling Blacks and Latinos like a lot of us aren‚Äôt professionals or educated and only do menial jobs. Not true! Remember, we had a President, Obama. We‚Äôre not in the slavery days! Remember those days when y‚Äôall beat, hung and raped us at a whim, for nothing as usual, just cruel. Stop crying and acting like y‚Äôall are so innocent and helpless with your mass murders and serial killers and rapists.
A wall that can be bypassed or destroyed, not to mention most drug traffic comes through air and sea, and most illegals use a legal passport or permit, look it up, not mention the effect on the wildlife this wall could have, i am all for security but there's got to be smarter ways to accomplish it and to invest our money
ahh priorities..priorities......
Then hire more border control security and use the funds to pay them not build a pointless wall, you twat.
Build wall. Shut down border. Deport ever single SOB that‚Äôs here illegal. Be making trillions because not feeding scum. MAGAFOREVER!!!!!!!
Democrats are just obstructionists that need to be hung for treason...
Build the wall. Somebody that knows how, start a GoFundMe.
Build the wall.  If walls don't work then the next DNC and RNC will not put a wall around the arena area they are at.  Lets all hold our breath.  They will be putting up walls...just wait.   What a bunch of elected idiots.
Shut down is fine! We hope for a New Party! No more corrupt Democrat Party! Please install not only Border Walls but An American People Freedom Party! What‚Äôs in America is for America until people out there learn to come into our country legally!
How about Congress take their pay, ALL OF IT, away to pay those who are not getting paid if they are so 'concerned' for the American people?! How about that?  MAYBE then they will get off their high horse ass n heads out of their asses get this shut down over with!!!
The vermin would sell out their country to get more votes.
Pelosi and Schumer are full of bull. It is their goal to deny you anything.  https://youtu.be/uDIrbU33o_Q

We want border security and we are tired of taking hardworking taxpayers money being used to take care of these people what the people nor and raised in this country I mean it's crazy how many people I know that both parents work overtime and they still have no health insurance I just don't get it sometimes I think democrats have dumbed this country down so much that maybe another country will just nuke us democrats won't shut up till there's nothing left
We do.  The Democrats need to get their heads out of their tails and fund the wall.
They are not after you. It's a dumb idea you narcissistic idiot.  What's more important is putting that money back into the nation not in a flaming barrier that provides nothing back.
Anyone else think that perhaps the real reason the left doesn‚Äôt want this is possibly the old divide and conquer thing, possibly created by NWO to make this country fail?  The wall makes total sense, at least financially. But the left doesn‚Äôt want to pay for it. But they‚Äôll pay subsidies for a sanctuary city. Two words. Illegal ( meaning not legal) alien ( meaning not of this nation) . By that definition, which is a very basic one, how can the left condone the immigration problem?  The wall needs to be in place!
Build the wall & lock them all up!!!
Thank god he‚Äôs off the air. What a fucking liar. Remove him by any means possible to preserve the constitution.
Only terrorists and stupid people are against the wall.  TRUMP 2020!
They dgaf about the American people, stop anything with trumps name on it at all cost, at any measure.  Lie, scream, distort, propagandize.  They dgaf... do what needs to be done at any cost.  Dont give them an opportunity or heads up on anything, that gives them time to twist and lie thier asses off.  We support you mr president, we voted for you to do, not play politics with these moronic crackheads...
smart border security, not a dumb ass wall.
Build the wall, anyone with a little common sense no we need it
Pelosi and Schumer are full of bull. It is their goal to deny you anything.  https://youtu.be/uDIrbU33o_Q
Build the wall, it is sad they try calling illegal immigrants, migrants, no they are illegal immigrants
you gotta make a consequence fit the argument : Shut down just the entitlement programs that illegals come here for at the hands of un-willing tax payers, then re-open the rest...you‚Äôll never lose this way.
Republicans are such sheep.  Are you all too dumb to actually see what this guy is doing.   Distraction Distraction Distraction.  Wake up people.   There is no crisis at the southern border.  The crisis is taking place in the Pumpkin man‚Äôs head.
Build the wall and then deport all criminals.
Instead of spending all this money on the wall why don't we use some to fix it up a little bit, but  also use some to strengthen our immigration laws, and also fix our welfare system. Instead of helping the lazy jerks that sit at all all day why not give them a reason to work instead of just giving them food stamps, section 8 and public housing. Why don't we reserve those things for the actual working middle class people who other wise can not afford to live and support their families even though they are working 40+ hours a week!
Please don‚Äôt activate the fucking obama care
Hopefully they'll come to their sences
GRAB MERICA BY THE PUSSY AND BUILD THE WALL
Build the wall, anyone with a little common sense no we need it
Wow, the garbage that is going on right now is absurd.  We've heard many Presidents say that border security is imperative yet it is still a problem today.  Why, because it's never been addressed like Donald J. Trump is addressing it.  Change is HARD, we cannot continue to allow floods of people to come here, for 1 many are ill and our healthcare systems are already taxed, 2 many/most don't speak English and if their children go to school the teachers have to accommodate/bring in additional bi-lingual teachers (another expense on our tax dollars)...I need to shut up.  Open borders aren't fair to those that want/need to come here legally and to allow them will only bring the U.S. down to a marginal/minimal way of life.  Not fair to anyone.
Screw the leftist losers!!!
Stop being a pussy and make those faggets build the wall
I believe in legal immigration but not illegal immigration.  If this continue this country will become a cesspool.  We have enough crime from our own citizens. We don‚Äôt need criminals from other countries
The majority don't want a wall. There is no security crisis at our southern border. You're shutdown is hurting families and the economy. You're keeping children in cages and allowing them to be physically and sexually abused. NO WALL! This is not Germany.
If you build the wall my generation will tare it down. The wall is almost as dumb as Trump saying there has been a border issue in the US for thousands of years... How can anyone support this lying, ignorant wanna be dictator.
Build the wall, deport all illegals, no benefits of any kind for illegals/"refugees" Tel them the American Frere Ride is over.
Your a FUCKING JOKE, CANT WAIT FOR BREAKING NEWS TO BE TRUMP HAS BEEN KILLED
You would have to be wilfully ignorant, or just a complete moron to not know that Trump is the most corrupt president in our nation's history.
GRAB MERICA BY THE PUSSY AND BUILD THE WALL
Your promise has been broken you fucktard. You said Mexicans were going to pay for that wall. Now the very people that voted for you are now not getting a paycheck, quit working, and now not protecting our country. So full of yourself but a great salesman you are.
Soon as food stamps run out the Democrats will be crying for border security to

Please don't forget to pray that God be merciful to us, for allowing our country to get this way.  For anyone who has the mind to do it, let's get on our knees and ask God's forgiveness for turning our backs on him.  We're the ones who have elected silly and evil people to our lawmaking offices.  Now we have to pray for rescue from them, that is, from the evil one who motivates them.  God bless.
They're a bunch of pathetic weirdos scumbags
Both sides have played the border wall card. Its just different now because... ya know... the POTUS is a dickhead.
We need to be protected from your worthless ass, you fucktard.
You are protecting us this idiot Democrats they don't want to give it to you that money because they're jealous you're going to be success that's what they don't want to give it to you
Lmao Asshat up there says gas is up to 3 bucks a gallon lmao must live in a blue state, here in Ohio it's under 2 bucks. Build that wall Mr President

why do you think we need a wall,, they don't just come through the airports ya know..  tell it congress..

It'll be great when the wall is finished them we can really fix our problems and not have to worry about illegals coming over
We need to secure the border, get rid of sanctuary cities, and really fix our country.
We need to stop allowing illegal aliens to come here and have babies to get them social security numbers! If you don‚Äôt have SS# neither should your child.
BUILD THE WALL!  American security and safety over political garbage!
We need a country with  common sense.we need a press that tells both sides of a story so people can judge there selves.ive never seen a country so messed up
Finished the border wall fence, it will help secure our border esp. our country security. Why much America spend to control the invasions of illegals w/ more coming plus those American cities w/ sanctuaries for those illegals

How are democrats stopping you from building a wall you said Mexico would pay for? Is it because you lied and are now trying to stick American tax payers with the $25 billion dollar wall. Your stupid wall idea only covers a small percentage of the country and does absolutely nothing to stop the 40% of immigrants that fly in. Your $25 billion dollar wall will do nothing to stop illegal immigration. Why dont you just be honest and admit you know how to embezel and extort a ton of money from this wall project.
Dennis Coughlan sssssshhhhhh
Susan Davison, I know right. The truth isnt something these trumpanzees want to hear.
Dennis Coughlan I don't get it, if I want to keep you out of my yard and I build a big ass wall with Barb wire on top with cameras , with sensors on the ground, your saying it won't stop you? It will stop   95% of it for sure
You must not have seen the videos of the fat woman with children walking across the very high 4' off the ground piece of wire and walking right in. Clueless
Mike Stoumbaugh, no it won't. Because if you build your wall like trumps, its only going to stop me from the south entrance. I've still got access from the East, West and North.
We need a country with  common sense.we need a press that tells both sides of a story so people can judge there selves.ive never seen a country so messed up
What a twat you are. The only reason you want to build that wall is to have your name on it The Trump wall. Like the The Trump tower. You selfish twat. Nothing is normal coming out from your little ugly piggy mouth ü§Æ
Go Trump. People seem to forget that the Clintons and the Obama government did nothing to sort out the border problems, so thousands of illegal immigrants under their rein poured into America and have robbed America of jobs, taxes and people's lives! Trump is trying to solve a problem caused by years of bad government but now you DemonRATS blame him! Guess you forgot The DemocRATS closed down the government too when they were in power. Apply legally to come into America and not illegally! Keep up the good work and don't let these snowflakes into power ever again. MAGA
the border is secure. you are unfit for office. RESIGN.
Would be an interesting experiment to put a wall around CA and see what kind of secure life they would end up with bearing in mind their mindset on allowing the illegals to stay in the US.  They want them, now live with them all confined to CA, but then again, you would have to keep them all within that wall.  I wonder just how long it would take before the people told the governor "Your Fired".
What an ass Mexico was supposed to pay that was the promise
Every poll taken shows that the majority of Americans don't want your expensive, unnecessary, stupid vanity wall which you want only so that you can brag to your uneducated base that you kept your promise. Even if you got the wall,  you.lied over and over again that Mexico would.pay for it. Trumped up fake crisis by a lying,  cheating, unqualified jerk of a president desperate to save his.own corrupt hide! Reopen the government and stop lying (if that is even possible!)
Even if you somehow get your stupid wall you still wouldn't be keeping your so called promise. Remember, YOU PROMISED MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR IT. Now you want American tax payers to pay for it.
Build the wall and drain the Pelosi swamp!
Build the wall and take the Democrats money and pay for the wall ESPECIALLY Nancy polsie's that dried up prune has got it lol
Mike Stoumbaugh, no it won't. Because if you build your wall like trumps, its only going to stop me from the south entrance. I've still got access from the East, West and North.

In fact, illegal immigration costs taxpayers a staggering $134.9 billion a year while contributing only $19 billion in state, federal, and local taxes. At the federal level, medical costs make up the lion‚Äôs share of government expenditures on illegal immigrants, while education is the largest single expense that illegal immigration imposes on state and local governments.  Sadly, an overloaded welfare state is not the only negative side-effect of our broken immigration system. Communities across America are also being devastated by the violent crime and drug trafficking that result from our failure to control the border ‚Äî an issue Donald Trump has addressed repeatedly and emphatically ever since he first announced his candidacy for president.
Federal workers on Furlough.....Do not give in.....Stand Strong Donald J. Trump Vets for Trump Why would you support someone not paying you.....hmmm.....That is because you are a true American and also served your country. Civilians have no concept of what freedom cost and want to whine about you or I not getting paid when in reality ,WE WILLINGLY go without pay because it is the right thing for the people and America first. We get our money back paid, they also do not know there are Emergency Relief funds available if you get bound up and need to get money, also when offered the job you sign a contract knowing you will work without pay if this happens. Americans want the freedoms United States provides as long as someone else is willing to provide them at no cost to them. They fear Gov. shutdown must be affecting their lives in some way because Democrats are telling them it is. Well it is, they are being led astray for open boarders, which is against our own countries laws to support. Another it is us We the people who care for the illegals. Our money , we earn for OUR Family is taken from us to care for them. The more that come into the country the more it cost and Democrats want more to come over 500,000. On average $18.00 a day per illegal in the country.

Bwhahaha üòÇ you promised Mexico would pay for it you dumb-f! üòÇ remember? ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs gonna pay for it?!?!‚Äù At your klan gathering. üòÇ
Keep it shut down, Mr President. We know you are fighting alone up there. But WE THE PEOPLE have your back. To Hell with those gutless republicans who refused to use the "nuclear option". Damn all of them.
Impeach the dumbass orange man
33% of people (aka your base) are the only ones that want it. You‚Äôre a complete dumbass.  I voted for you because I‚Äôm independent and you said you would drain the swamp and you weren‚Äôt a politician. You are a traitor to the US and tax cheat that uses the oval to line your pockets while you spread lies to your base because they are too uneducated to call you out on your BS. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Build the fucking wall and cage yourself.
When the wall is finally built throw Pelosi and Schumer over it.
I‚Äôm neither party but if you think a wall is going to stop drugs from coming in here and the murder rate is going drop you are crazy and believe me I‚Äôm all about protecting our country been there done that. If you want to convince me about boarder protecting put in mine fields, gun towers with air support from Apache helicopters. It will be 100 times effective a lot cheaper and guess what... it will produce jobs especially for our veterans! Once you see love ones getting their heads blown off better yet blown to pieces I bet you stop trying to cross! VIOLENCE is the ANSWER üíØüá∫üá∏üíØa wall what a joke! Where you thing the drugs and real terrorist are coming from! It‚Äôs sure not south of the boarder! They fly in from ALL over the world and let their VISA run out!

Build the wall or bring back the scalp trade
The DEA doesn't want the wall because it won't help. Drugs come in primarily through normal points of entry, or by boat, plane. Illegal immigrants, on the scale that affect american jobs, come in via overstays. It's pure bullshit. We don't need this wall. Illegal immigration across the southern border has been trending down and is now net NEGATIVE. The idea that the wall will improve the US Job market is nonsense. What is at stake here is bigger than $5bn in the federal budget. It is about making decisions RATIONLLY and on the basis of facts and analysis of them. https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/29/trump-says-border-wall-will-stop-drugs-heres-what-a-dea-intel-report-says/
2020 no more bullshit go Trump . Don‚Äôt stop now
Oh dear , but didn‚Äôt they(terrorists )fly in an attack New York ..... you should not be letting government employees shoulder the burden of the shut down , its not their crisis and when senators are about to receive a pay increase...... the world is watching an sniggering at this circus !!!
The Democrats are only refusing because of who is asking. That is it. They did not act like that when Obama was President. He should have been thrown in Prison along with Hillary...but they did nothing. But yet, they keep going after President Donald J. Trump. It doesn't matter what it is, they will keep working against our President and every member in the Federal government that is doing that needs to be kicked out of Office. We want our elected Officials to what we elected them to do, and that is to secure our borders and keep our country safe. We write their pay checks...it's time they do their job..or get out!
Yeah, border security, not a pointless fucking wall
Lock them up for treason!  They are not for securing our border but willing to spend tons of money for illegals??
Build the wall. Keep the government shut down with no pay till its funded. Citizens and taxpayers safety first. Why are we paying taxes to political hacks not serving us but their own interest in a first place? Perhaps we should stop paying till the swamp is drained and term limits are in place.
Obviously, the thing that is most important to the demoncrats is to destroy America.
Build it on Mexico side
Democrats just want cheap labor and votes .phony bastards
Build that wall!!! Suck it up and get over it ,you crybaby Dems! You don‚Äôt care about the people ( the US citizens or the immigrants) you just hate Trump because he stands for the people not his own agenda. üò°
Build that wall Trumpy. Promises made promises kept!
Build the wall get on with fire all the demo rats we don't need them anyway
Send ALL the illegals to Ca. and let them deal with the problem. See how long that last.
Most of amerika want you to go back to Russia
Shut up already you blowhard. So sick of your lying face I could puke. Worst president of my lifetime, hands down.
Build the wall cos it's job creation. Use steal so you have to paint it which is more job creation. Give Mexicans proper work visas so they don't get exploited . Spend money on this and stop the oil stealing wars that pay terrorists.

Shut down the boarder period. The lost trade would be Mexico's share of the build and for those US businesses that lose revenue on the can claim from the pot of money not being paid to illegals and noncitizens.
Our country is in massive debt. Letting in more and more illegals will continue to make OUR debt, healthcare cost, job loss, and lots of other problems increase. Who's going to pay for it? Increase taxes? There's going to be a point where the government asks to much of its citizens and it will cripple all Americans into relying on a government that can't afford it. The problem is wasteful spending by our government. I know a lot of people think the wall is wasteful spending but I ask you, compare it to the next 10 years of taking care of new citizens who can't take care of themselves? Majority of the people crossing the border illegally are not skilled and are looking for our government to take care of them. If it continues it will be our largest economic downfall in history... And we are doing it to ourselves. One party wants this, why? Simple, future votes... Anyone coming across the boarder currently has the chance of becoming a citizen and will vote for the party helping them... That will silent your vote as current citizen.... Something to think about.
Mr.President  You have to shut down obamas state of emergencies. And take down these crooks. The time is now. Before the next bunch of crazys steal their way into our government.  Look its time to fight these crooks. File state of emergency and tell America what these crooks have been doing. And their plan to bring America down. Please I see the time. And Americans at least some have no ideal. But you know the truth and if you wait . These people will keep it up until America is gone. The power is yours to save America from foreign powers and these sick sick evil people. GOD is real and to save America is to break the back of this state and government crooks. You can tell yourself these people will back off. They will not. And if they tell you this they are evil liars . You know the truth. Now save this NATION before its destroyed and can't be fixed. You are the Man. And our prayer and hopes are in you . Because GOD allowed you this time.  Remember this maybe the only chance we as true Americans get. Thank you. And may GOD guide you with power to destroy evil. I Believe. So do what's right.
As long as it KEEPS ILLEGALS OUT OF THIS COUNTRY works for me! BUILD it right in the first place so we won't have to keep doing it! You'd THINK, with AS MANY Congressmen/women that are MILLIONAIRES, that they would HELP to make our country safer, but they're so tight fisted and require so much more of us citizens. They want this country to fail so they can make it a socialist country!
Why don't the president STOP the free ride for the illegal immigrants that are in America illegally?? Stop the free ride!!!
The companies that used to be in America and move to Mexico make them pay for the fucking wall like Chrysler GM Hersey must I go on . I hope President Trump gets this message those companies went to Mexico for cheaper labor and then fucked the American people out of jobs. Never again will I buy a American product that was Built in Mexico.
Build the walls and then put bombs along it.
Please HELP to STOP CORRUPTION in Romania! Thieves and convicted people in the Government! NO ETHICS! Political system over Justice.  Communism undercover! Thank you and GOD bless us!
Democrats are not afraid the wall won't work. They are afraid the wall will work! #TRUMP2020 #MAGA
And all I here from the Democrats is raise taxes without the wall. I'm beginning to see more problems from Democrats then from Mexico. Cut Mexico off now!
Build the wall cos it's job creation. Use steal so you have to paint it which is more job creation. Give Mexicans proper work visas so they don't get exploited . Spend money on this and stop the oil stealing wars that pay terrorists.
They suck President Trump! Thank God ur President. America still has a chance
Yes. Keep us safe from them and all the disease they bring with them. I cant afford to get sick thanks to Obummer care. <><
Stand your ground Mr. President.  Build that wall! It's time that America does for the American people.. stop all foreign aid, induce term limits theres too many corrupt people in congress. We need to do away with big pharma ( the ones lining the Democrats crooked little pockets and turning them against their own country), Nancy and Chuck also need to be held accountable for putting America at risk by causing delays to national security.
Ask pelosi why do you have a wall around your house. I‚Äôm so sick of these brain dead Dems. You are the ones I‚Äôd like to impeach. DO YOUR DAM JOBS!
Democratic Party are all a bunch of hypocrites! Please build the wall and drain the swamp! You are doing a wonderful job as our president! Thank you and God Bless you and our nationüá∫üá∏üôè
Here's a thought on how to help fund the wall/fence/barrier and indirectly make Mexico pay for it. Levy a $20 tax on every money order being sent from individuals in the US to individuals in Mexico. Millions leave our country every day in the form of money orders sent from here to there. Many illegal immigrants work here, live on very little so they can send thousands back home with the plan of retiring there. That is money that benefits Mexico's economy instead of ours.
Stopping you is always #1 for the Democrats. You could say you were giving all of your wealth to everyone below the poverty line and they would do everything to stop you.
They want illegals to come in! They‚Äôre gonna need workers for the marijuana fields.... üò≤ü§îü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Walls work where you put them.  Let‚Äôs get walls going where Border Patrol has identified they want them. What can it hurt?  This country blows enough money on stupid stuff. Amazing how Obama could stuff planes full of cash to Iran but nothing for Trumps wall?

Oh my god some one needs to give me a call because I live down south and illegals kill our animals and breaking in to houses while children are sleeping to steal; there are barrels set out with high flags with Augua to stop them from damaging our property
Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets. But if you listen to mainstream media or the Democrats nothing wrong with our borders.
James McCaskill I know and it makes me so mad that everyone has an opinion but never experience the effects
Lora Hill Well one reason is all the mainstream media will show is some women and kids trying to come in. Not the thousands of drug runners who terrorize anyone who gets in your way. Or the one officer who covers 1000 square miles. Are the families whose lives are threatened by the cartels.
James McCaskill  yes and we the family comes in to support them is about6,000 dollars a month
Lora Hill it's has to stop now or we will become a 3rd world country. But that's what the globalist are hoping for. I for one don't know what to do but get ready to fight. Just wanting on someone to say GO!!

James McCaskill  yes and we the family comes in to support them is about6,000 dollars a month
You promised mexico would pay for it.Lies are all you bring to the table.Worst president in the history of our country.
Dear president  Trump,I am  so  sorry  for  the  way  you  are  being  treated .  I thank  God  for  putting  you  in  the  White  house  I hope  you  succeed  in all you  plan if it's   in  God's  will. God's  will and his plan must come first. If you  let the Lord  lead you  then the devil has no power . WE will  be  praying  for  you .
Yes, border security is a must and special for a republic. If not the hyenas, zebras, and the wild dogs will enter the republic and take cover under democracy as every hooliganism is done under democracy.
No we don't want another wall Trump, we need better trade and jobs...we need cheap illegal immigrants to do our dirty work
My Prez, do what i elected you to do! Hell with stupid idiots with fences around their yards!
Anyone that can‚Äôt see this is political is a pure idiot !!!
Chuck and Nancy want to build a wall with the bodies of American Citizens. They have a good start. Their illegal aliens slaughter Americans daily. Among other hideousness crimes.
We need more to stop those who would enter illegally, wall/fence/whatever you want to call it - BUILD IT (so they don't come) ;) lol
Paula Gluck and you obviously need a brain . Says the one with the last name that's the sound when I chug a beer lol. Gluck the duck
Donald, with all your billions, why don‚Äôt you build a 50 foot steel wall around yourself and stay there. We need to protect ourselves from you. You are crazy, corrupt and dangerous !!!
Illegals are bringing disease like HIV and TB and sticking us with the bill
Yes Build the Wall, our security is at risk, I‚Äôm convinced that Dems care more about illegals than the citizens they are sworn to protect üò° Ask yourself why they want all this chaos at the border??? Who‚Äôs getting kickbacks from all the drugs that come across #followthemoney
Donald your doing great. Build that wall and tell the Democrats to go to hell. They are worthless deal killers. We love God Country and proud your our president
Hey do you stupid trump supporters ever feel it in the ass?
I say that Trump you should demand the justice department to file criminal charges against local leaders, and state government leaders who knowingly violate: U.S. Code ‚Ä∫ Title 8 ‚Ä∫ Chapter 12 ‚Ä∫ Subchapter II ‚Ä∫ Part VIII ‚Ä∫ ¬ß 1324                                                                                             (iii)   knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of transportation;                                       Sanctuary cities????
We sure do! 100% behind you Mr. PRESIDENT do not let Dems kill America! Fight Fight Fight you are RIGHT!!!
No. They don‚Äôt.   "Because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it," Trump continued, seemingly oblivious to the fact that he was taking ownership of a potentially costly and unpopular breakdown in federal government operations.
Forget the Wall.. Just take away the reward.  Enforced laws make it illegal to hire Illegals.. Laws with teeth and severe penalties.  Simple.
We need more to stop those who would enter illegally, wall/fence/whatever you want to call it - BUILD IT (so they don't come) ;) lol
Build the wall, borrow the money from Mexico, then don't pay it back.
Its not fair that we pay taxes for illegals and the fact that they have bought up 75% of dallas where is all this money coming from whentheyco.e from nothing why do we have to pay for them ??? Also how do illegals file taxes with no legal documents?? I have a diverse family and i am for every one but this is not right nor fair to us BUILD THE WALL!!
Wow what a fucking coward .... rump is in the sewer where he is most comfortable spewing crap üí©
I want immigrants to come here legally we have drugs and crime overflowing from the border build the wall
Them Democrats need a pay cut all useless!! Build the wall ! You are the president
Democrats want more Illegals so they get more votes
I wish congress would get off our president Trumps back and let our President do his job and keep his campaign promise and make our country safe or has congress and the American people 4-got 911. We the Americans  pay our taxes, pay our own bills p ay for our own homes work for supporting our family.  What does the Illegal immigrants pay for ?
Americans do not want to pay for border security.  Just your uneducated trumptards.
They will never go for anything just because they hate and love to spite the President.
Schumer and Pelosi 2  slimey snakes that look guilty...
Build the wall! How many of you have fences around your yard and would prefer someone to knock on your front door before walking around your backyard, fences protect you and your family the border is the same thing we're not against immigrants just illegal immigration!
69% don't think your temper tantrum Wall is necessary at this moment. 59% OPPOSE  it altogether. Grow up you inept, paid grades educated, coward. Bone spurs kept your chickenass out of military service but they don't seem to hurt your fatass playing golf.
President Trump. Have a group of people make a list of all the crimes committed to American‚Äôs from illegals. Plus all the illegals that are working and getting paid money who are not paying taxes. I would bet that number to be in the billions. These facts will show congress that we need a wall.
Americans want better pay and less cost of living . Good health insurance and less medication idiot
They want power and greed..at our expense. I'm so sick of congress.
Build the wall, toss those who oppose it over it and let‚Äôs see how well it works!
We live on the border. Its scary at best! The country has no idea of the drugs and criminals and drug runners pouring over the border. BUILD THE WALL. We support the shut down.
Build the wall! It‚Äôs the morally correct thing to do because it will save lives.
Build a wall, after the wall is build then what? All illegal aren‚Äôt able to get in any more, You think your still safe? Not! God made haven and earth he never put walls in haven and he never put wall on earth! You were born with out a wall, right? You came through your mother‚Äôs camel. She didn‚Äôt put a wall for you to be born out right? Think about that. If you put a wall to everything you don‚Äôt want in then you have a big problem. I‚Äôm not saying illegal to come in to the USA. Without papers. Is there a wall in hell? Nope! You choose haven or hell?
You would not say he‚Äôs the best president if you were not receiving a pay check. I have work on my desk that needs my attention. People are counting on me to do my job.  Let Mexico pay for the wall as he promised. Oh wait, Mexico said go f_ck yourself.  A wall is not a solution!!!
They will never go for anything just because they hate and love to spite the President.
Your promises are worthless, just like you Trump.
The wall is already there, so it's obviously not doing much good considering you're still bitching and moaning about illegal immigration. How about you come up with a better idea to combat illegal immigration?!? You complain about the security concerns for the country not taking into consideration that tsa agents are doing a very shitty job at American airports because they're not getting paid. YOU are making us vulnerable to terrorists!!
Over 40 years of B S Lying stories from both sides .And it's Trumps fault ,I don't think .Any one that doesn't know this yet isn't paying attention or just plan stupid ,Build that Fucking wall that should of been built over 40 years ago .End Of Story !! Hate Trump ,what a joke.and the joke is on the American people and your so called Politicians are laughing their asses off ,Wake Up America !!
We should have had more secure borders 30 yrs ago or more. The illegals  and drug runners and murderers would not be so rampant in our country.  Democrats DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!!!!! THEY  ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH STOPPING TRUMP NO MATTER WHAT. We may have to suffer a bit more, but we need him to stay strong for what this country needs for all of us to survive. This is AMERICA! Not Mexico, not Guatemala,  not Saudi Arabia.........etc. THIS IS OUR COUNTRY.  THE AMERICAN WAYS. TAKE YOUR WAYS BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY. NOT OURS!!!
Pelosi should be bent over and spanked and Schumer should be bitched slapped! Talk about lying bullshit these two Stir It Up!
There is no crisis at the border. you Are fueling hate. Your paranoid.
Your promise was taxpayers would not pay for a wall, that Mexico will pay for it!!! Looks like you lied!!!! You want a wall so bad why don‚Äôt you pay for it??? Start a go fund me account for all your supporters that want this wall built and let them pay for it and you match them!!!  Why don‚Äôt you invite all the federal employees to your hotel to stay and feed them until the shut down ends!!! I don‚Äôt feel sorry for the ones who stand for you, they are getting what they deserve by voting for you.
BUILD THE WALL DO NOT BOW DOWN TO THE DEMOCRAPS.
The Democrats are the enemies within.  They will leave no stone unturned until they destroy America from within. Build the wall Mr. President!!!
You would not say he‚Äôs the best president if you were not receiving a pay check. I have work on my desk that needs my attention. People are counting on me to do my job.  Let Mexico pay for the wall as he promised. Oh wait, Mexico said go f_ck yourself.  A wall is not a solution!!!
Give everyone in the federal government except Congress their paychecks and build the damn wall
I would just like to say the Democrats don't give a rats ass about the citizens of the U.S. Why do they keep calling it Trump's wall???? THIS IS THE AMERICAN CITIZEN'S WALL!!!!! WHAT IS IT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT??? This is why we elected President Trump to do. The American people have spoken...BUILD THE AMERICAN CITIZEN WALL!!!!!
You said Mexico would pay for it, so go get the money from them you clown
Then get it built your the president, to hell with those clowns.
Build the wall, but pay the Coast Guard!
Interesting poll. Americans are certainly concerned about all manner of things. So...no explanation why "government" is at the top of the list and rising, while "immigration" is below that and falling? Oh, 16% of (mostly Republican) Americans think immigration is a problem, what a dramatic result! I've got an explanation. Fox News lied. Like you do, every time you open your mouth.  You know, it's almost like it's more important to us that we don't have a bunch of indolent, lying shitbags in Washington than that we build a worthless monument to xenophobia and paranoia. Go secure yourself.
Why must the libs stay on this side of the wall after we build it? Cant we deport these treasonous devils,its clear they hate this country? Just saying build that wall and deport anyone who doesnt like our countries freedom.
There are a lot of dumb ass-- in this world sorry about the ass-- but quite necessary and Donald Trump ain't one of them just a man of his word and that's most important stand by your word

Maureen Ryan Two years you people have been chasing the Russians. So, tell me, WHAT did the Russians do to influence your vote? Did you see something that we missed?  Tell us, what EXACTLY are you looking for? The FBI can't find it, the CIA can't either, Pelosi can't say what it is, neither can MSM. What are you looking for? Please tell.
What no come back?.

Im with trump but you said Mexico would pay and now alot of people american people will be fucked come Friday and that's bullshit...don't we have enough people struggling paycheck to paycheck and now you made alot of people unable to pay bills come Friday.
schumer and pelosi are pieces of crap. I hope there is a hell.
Stoping an ignorant moron like you sir, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important
What will help is an immigration system like Canada and validation of immigration status. Visitor and employment visa‚Äôs are straightforward. Employers who hire illegals need big fines. They should use employment agencies to take immigrants who qualify.   Trump could also accept the recommendation to put more judges and immigration lawyers at the point of entry.  This would reduce the the misery of 60 per day and reduce the desperation of the thousands of poor huddled masses we used to welcome.
Build the wall i stand for trump
Shut yo fat, old ,wrinkly, bald ass up .Casket waiting for you!
Part 2 of the article I started: Terrrorists Know the U.S. Border Is Not Secure  A Costa Rican immigration service official whose jurisdiction includes the Golfito camp disclosed that at least several other U.S.-bound suspected terrorists also were pulled from this camp since Qoordheen‚Äôs March 2017 arrest, likewise based on significant derogatory U.S. counterterrorism intelligence. The Costa Rican official declined to provide specifics of the intelligence beyond that it involved terrorism, offering only that: ‚ÄúMost are good, but some are bad.‚Äù  The American public was never told that Qoordheen and other suspected terrorists were pulled off U.S.-bound migrant routes in distant Costa Rica and Panama because such information is usually classified or not disclosable, in line with standard practice to protect ongoing investigations and operations.  That necessary opacity, unfortunately, seems to have given life to denialism about President Trump‚Äôs claims that terrorists are among migrants from countries of terror concern, like the Middle East. The skeptics have demanded proof then cited Trump perfidy when protected intelligence wasn‚Äôt provided. Trump‚Äôs assertions were thus ridiculed and dismissed as unsupported fear-mongering.  But the rejectionists, many of whom obviously do not know that a central homeland security practice is threat preemption, are wrong. Down here, on the southern-most leg of migrant routes to the American border, it is they who invite ridicule and eye rolls.  American, Panamanian, and Costa Rican law enforcement and intelligence officials are engaged in actual programs here to hunt, investigate, and deport real terrorist suspects who are, in fact, discovered among the thousands of migrants from the Middle East, Horn of Africa, and South Asia funneling through this section of Latin America‚Äîas President Trump said and as I saw and heard on the ground.  Migrants from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka processing through Costa Ricans customs at Paso Canoas on the Panama border. They are working at it here because sheer geography pushes tens of thousands of U.S.-bound migrants from all over the world who pass from South America landing zones through these two countries as they push north. Panama and Costa Rica are chokepoints on the migrant trail where ‚Äúextra-continental‚Äù travelers, as they are sometimes called at the American embassies, can become known in the greatest concentrations.  Terror Migrants Pulled From U.S. Border Routes Some acknowledgements of terror travel through these countries‚Äîand of the American efforts to mitigate it‚Äîare in public evidence, even if the underlying reporting remains confidential.  A December 19 Immigration and Customs Enforcement statement, for instance, announced the deportation of U.S.-convicted Brazil-based smuggler Sharafat Ali Khan after time served for transporting at least 100 aliens from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh through South and Central America to the United States. The statement offered this nugget, with the usual lack of elaboration: ‚ÄúSeveral of the individuals smuggled by Khan‚Äôs organization had suspected ties to terrorist organizations.‚Äù  The new statement seems to comport with earlier reporting by The Washington Times that one of these individuals was an Afghan involved in a plot to attack in the United States or Canada and had family ties to members of the Taliban.

Boarder became stronger than it had ever been under Obama, anywhere that needs a fence has a fence lol. Poor fella, Trump looked so deflated and pissy during his pathetic oval office rant.  If our Russian hooker piss loving POTUS actually cared about illegal immigration he'd stop hiring them at his failing golf courses and address Visa overstays. But nope, not a peep about how illegal immigration actually occurs lol. Thank Allah that a patriot like Mueller continues to destroy the Trump daycare

Fox News is a propaganda machine for Russia‚Äôs handpicked candidate‚ÄîTrump.  Good Americans would abandon Fox and put effort into removing their heads from Trump‚Äôs ass.  Trump is a wife beater and fraud. A conspirator and adulterer.
If you promised to rape someone, would you say we had to choose between you raping someone or border security? You're an idiot.
More americans are shot in mass shooting by white christian republicans than anyone coming here from south of the border. We need a wall around them

MAGA - Morons Are Governing America and Many Are Getting Arrested as well as many more are resigning the dumptanic while they still have some integrity, morals, values, principles, and respect for our country of which this regime has none. Border security is needed, but not a archaic vanity wall that is not needed and serves no purpose other than the moronic liar in the WH and his sycophant minions and Jim Jones cult45ers.
I hope he goes around them all and builds this wall.............this is a national emergency, we can't afford to take everyone in. These illegals will bankrupt  our country. Our benefits are for us, not for them!
Build the wall! Without shutting down the government you hypocrite! You said your for the people...
BUILD THE WALL OUR LIVES AND FUTURE DEPEND ON IT.

LMBO you have kept NO promises you say you have but you have not...FACT CHECK IT   Most Americans are blaming you for the shutdown and in2020 that will be very good news..Keep it up moron because more and more people are hating you..
We might need a wall around Ca for the protection of Americans.
Build the North Wall first. That‚Äôs where the real terrorists enter the country.
Americans also wanted you to do something about our children being killed in our schools. Did you do anything about that?  No of course not. Big money donations from the NRA stopped that . Didn't it???? You pathetic hypocrite üëπüí©
The caravan was real. The chaos at the border is real. The 4000 murders the last two years by illegals is real. The 90% of the drugs flowing through the border is real. The fact that elected officials sworn duty is to protect the nation is real. Democrats are a disgrace.
Finish the Trump Wall protect Americans anything else is just stupid .
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have tax payer paid for 24 hour Security Protection as do all politicans yet she does not want average Americans protected and refuses to vote for the wall to protect America. HYPOCRITE

Remember President Trump , the Dems are the party of slavery , Jim Crowe , KKK , Neo Nazi , Black Lives Matter , Black Panthers , Antifia , Santuary states , And Cities , Now they want open borders, illegals to vote and drive without citizen ship , and our Benefits, plus no rule of law , what the hell going on here Wake up America shame on the Dems Trump Strong üí™
I still say that if we cut all aid to illegals,  no more birthright citizenship, or chain migration they will not want to come.
I'm so glad Trump pulled this stupid ass stunt, he has no chance at all in 2020 now, his base is between 20 and 25 percent of legal voters laughable idiots, all of them and they will lose.
2/3 of Americans don't want the wall, so quit lying you orange dildo.

More importantly! The kind of news not told by CNN and these other globalist,  no more borders, deep-state-controlled media!: Donald Trump - Red Dawn is Here  and America better Prepare!  https://youtu.be/Cj52fYsOVF8
Sir , it doesn‚Äôt matter to them , it‚Äôs you they despise, nothing you can do to change that. Just move on to the next agenda , hire more border guards and patrol it heavier , hate to say it but there will be no wall of barrier to protect us .  Voting-for  you again !

Please hurry up Armageddon lol I cant wait till these brain dead dumbacrats or dealt with by the very things they asked for .I will be lmao. The Third Temple is coming . Babylon and this new Sodom and Gomorrah will perish ha ha ha ha haaaa!!!!
I have done some research this past week and found information that has me upset and needing to share.  1. When an immigrant comes to the US and claims Asylum, they are given an expedited hearing within 1-3 days. If they are found to have a credible cause for asylum (which they know exactly what to say), they are given a court date and released into the US. They are then considered an asylee. Since 2007, asylum claims are up 1700%. 2. Once they get asylee status, they can apply for a social security number, Medicaid, and (in States that allow it) other assistance.  3. In most states, all you need to vote is a social security number.  4. Because of extreme backlogs of court dockets due to the increase of Asylum claims, The average wait for their final asylum hearing is almost 3 years.  5. During this 3 years, if they have a child (anchor baby) their chances of getting granted Asylum increase exponentially!  6. The illegals and non- citizens are counted by the census bureau and are included in the US population.  7. A State's population determines how many seats a state gets in the house of Representatives. 8. A State's population determines how many electoral votes a state is given. California would have 9 less electoral votes if the illegal and non- citizens were not included in the population counts.  9. Perfect reason why sanctuary cities/States have been created. It is to overwhelm the system for political gain. Getting the population up in sanctuary cities/States = political advantage and power through exploitation. I now understand why the Dems want an open border. They have figured out a way to exploit our elections by using existing immigration laws. I can't understand for the life of me why this information has not been used to justify why we need a wall and a secure border. Please share this information to everyone you know. The excuses the Dems are using to keep the border flowing must be exposed.  Thank you!

I have done some research this past week and found information that has me upset and needing to share.  1. When an immigrant comes to the US and claims Asylum, they are given an expedited hearing within 1-3 days. If they are found to have a credible cause for asylum (which they know exactly what to say), they are given a court date and released into the US. They are then considered an asylee. Since 2007, asylum claims are up 1700%. 2. Once they get asylee status, they can apply for a social security number, Medicaid, and (in States that allow it) other assistance.  3. In most states, all you need to vote is a social security number.  4. Because of extreme backlogs of court dockets due to the increase of Asylum claims, The average wait for their final asylum hearing is almost 3 years.  5. During this 3 years, if they have a child (anchor baby) their chances of getting granted Asylum increase exponentially!  6. The illegals and non- citizens are counted by the census bureau and are included in the US population.  7. A State's population determines how many seats a state gets in the house of Representatives. 8. A State's population determines how many electoral votes a state is given. California would have 9 less electoral votes if the illegal and non- citizens were not included in the population counts.  9. Perfect reason why sanctuary cities/States have been created. It is to overwhelm the system for political gain. Getting the population up in sanctuary cities/States = political advantage and power through exploitation. I now understand why the Dems want an open border. They have figured out a way to exploit our elections by using existing immigration laws. I can't understand for the life of me why this information has not been used to justify why we need a wall and a secure border. Please share this information to everyone you know. The excuses the Dems are using to keep the border flowing must be exposed.  Thank you!

Very strange to many of us Constitutional Liberal Democrats. We have watched our Country get attacked over the last 30 years, escalating worse each time. Each time they warned us they would strike again. Each time they planned, practiced, and did it again. Does the Leftist condone this now??? If they think this threat is not real, why are you upset about bringing our Troops home. Fact: Leon Panetta' warned us our Electric Grids are in fact at risk and if hit could cripple our Nation, including our food supply. Does the Leftist doubt we WILL get hit again. Secure our Borders.  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1980380702266756&id=1452341315070700
Not Apartheid Zionist Wall for colonization. Thanks. Take that Shite back across the pond from whence it came.
what do you think when it comes to Donald Trump for one don‚Äôt trust him and why he constantly lies all of the time and you can‚Äôt believe him and also he‚Äôs Evil the snake üêç in the grass just waiting to bite you with his venom. ‚ÄòThis president lies daily‚Äô: Critics demand networks fact-check Trump‚Äôs live immigration speech. I think it‚Äôs time for a newer President and get rid of the trash meaning Donald Trump and he isn‚Äôt worthy to be the President or not worthy enough to be in the Whitehouse no longer. Trump said Friday that some previous presidents "have told me that we should have done it."  The four living ex-presidents do not back Trump up on that claim, you see that‚Äôs another lie on top of another lie
The Democrats are a joke!! Hold strong, no more illegals
Build the wall ,stop the Drugs from pouring in save the children  !!!!
I would like to see these people speak up to qualify his claim of holding hands.
They end up at gitmo, #Demoncrats
For Demorats it doesn‚Äôt matter if it is good for America.  Their hate for Trump is greater than their love for America!  Evil and Sad!!!
There are no more Democrats they are imbeciles  Their only goal is to secure their own benefits.  And To go against you cause you‚Äôre name is  Donald J Trump Don‚Äôt mind them Boss!! We got your back All America has your back The real Constitutionalists have your back And we are right her and there with you We are everywhere And they ( our enemies) are scrambling and running like chickens without heads !! YOU KEEP BEING WHO YOU ARE
Build the wall then focus on draining the swamp starts with ousting islam from our government
Build the wall or keep it shut down!  Start going after the 30 million illegals already here instead.  Door to door if you have to. Stop letting the numbers grow and do something about all of it. Enforce the law! If they wont do it our way , then lets spend billions enforcing the existing law and sweep the country for all illegals.
Having Mexico pay for it was your promise you spin doctoring pathological liar
Your promise was that Mexico would pay for the wall! -- Liar!!

BUILD THAT STEEL WALL & THROW ALL DEMOCRATS OVER IT! ü§£
The wall is a waste of tax payer money. They can't keep drugs out of prisons yet you think a wall is going to stop the flow of drugs into the country or immigrants? Also you'd have to steal people's property to eminent domain.
We don't need a border wall.  We don‚Äôt need to create artificial crises. We have enough real ones. Let us end this shutdown and bring the American people together around an agenda that will improve life for all of our people.
Build that wall Mr President!!! Screw what the CRAZY LIBTARDS want!! Who cares about the shut down? Libtards!! We all know that they dont matter. They are crazy, sick individuals. Obuma shut down the Government to force the shitty Obuma Care on the American people.  BUILD THAT WALL!!!
There should be a laugh track for every time trump lies during his Oval Office speech.
Someone left a bag of idiots open.
I'm not a Democrat why do you always blame democrats. Fact is in still waiting on property clean up from Epa in Texas. And I defended you for 35 yrs of my damn life. Here's facts Trump you said Mexico would pay for the damn wall. Want more promises wrote out you made that I believe you never intended to keep. I could write them. I'm one went bankrupt. Most of the people are coming from Guatemala do I need to say that's not Mexico. I want cleaned up property so that I can make money. Not just buy a damn piece of property with some inheritance money to breed and sell horses, dogs, etc and food. You need to take responsibility for saying Mexico would pay. I always say stand tall , keep ur head up etc. When do I get my property cleaned up?  When does my daughter and grandkids get moved out? You need to answer those questions. Things take money don't they ? It's funny seeing all these damn people rich just like Clinton in here and yet look at bills son of mixed races. So, many make me out right sick. I should come first. And again FOX sucks. Homefree Fox and my own mortgage company in the past could give free houses away to in poisoned property. EPA has a duty to clean my property up. I don't want to shop to buy homemade goods from other people. Will you pay me 300,000 for my property the way it is right now. If so, I would like to sell. Otherwise I need it cleaned up to sell. It's a need more important than in my eyes ur damn wall right now. I'm sure you can order it done. Then you might get some wall or might not. I'm going to say again I supported you defending you 35 yrs of my life and I don't see you ever intended to get Mexico to pay. My nieces and nephew in Mexico motherless need help to get over here to United States. It takes lots of money or at some point to get out of an orphanage they will need to be scratch backs or wet backs,  wall climbers. What if Congress gives you 150 feet. My front yard is 300 ft. Better work on Mexico to pay right I know you want to keep your promises. Right
Seems to me it's a political stunt. Democrats can't seem to come to terms that your doing a great job for our country. They thought it wouldn't happen. You proved them wrong, and it's killing them.

I hope Donald trump you fast remove all the war because nobody want to die
Build the wall/fence. Just protect the border!!!!
Isn‚Äôt Funny how a part of our society can hate people who Bully other people !! But then turn on are President And Bully him 24/7 I guess that would make you Lying hypocrite that‚Äôs a Bully. Right Chuck,Nancy you to are most likely at a party celebrating telling the biggest LIE of your criminal career. The smart people know better. God Bless America and are President...
Build the wall and start  spearing and displaying the heads of the heinous criminals caught being here and killing our citizens
Mr. Donald Trump ok you're making it very very clear you hate all poor people ok I got three words for ya buddy burn burn burn baby burn but remember you caused and created this pal
AMERICA DOES NOT WANT THE EFFING WALL!! I'm listening to you addressing the nation right now and you have convoluted the facts so grossly ... my God, you are an imbecile!  Spreading fear with your lies!!!  If you want the wall so badly, you pay for it and then you can recoup the money from Mexico!  To Trump followers, you have to be brain dead to believe this man.
Build the wall! Just put... Another brick in the wall
Build the wall at least it can help
So one of the Demons talking points is that only 30% of illegal immigration comes across the border. Lets assume that is a fact, shouldn't we still stop 30% of illegal immigration by building the wall won't that allow more assets to go to the over staying visa's problem. But what do I know I am a Deplorable Trump Supporter

Take the SNAP program from Migrants and seasonal farm workers.  Take away the free rides!    Start investigation on the Democratic‚Äôs. You know some of them are dirty!  Your doing a great job!!!!
Please just build the wall and have our great  military men and women build it and place our National Guard there and at the Canadian border also.  Schumer and Pelosi are anti American and should be charged with treason against our great nation.  Open borders means our borders get bum rushed by anyone and everyone looking for a free pass.  Then sign their stupid bill...
Before we get too indignant over the Saudi's beheading of a journalist we must remember that these people are merely several centuries behind us on their cultural and ethical journey. Our own noble sixteenth-century English forebears burned over 300 Protestants at the stake, an equally hideous form of execution, And they burned William Tynndale in 1535 for translating the Bible into English. Another translator, John Wycliffe escaped by dying a natural death before his scheduled bar - b - cue. But they exhumed his body and burned it anyway, just to be sure. Civilized, Christian behavior?
Ohh Kevin you are such an idiot. There is no help for you. You will just die stupid.
Democrats should come to their senses and work with the President. American people are sick and tired with the crooked politicians. Americans want security, honesty and hard work to MAGA......
Expose the dirt on these politicians!!!! They will be singing a different tune then!!! BUILD THE WALL!!! GOD will prevail!!!
You guys all make very good points. Let's keep up the good work and support our president. If we need to, that's even march on the capitol. The lazy ass Democrats and socialist liberal assholes are out working us as far as really making a stand. We need to March we need to protest we need to shut the government all the way down if we have to. All the Democrats care about is trying to drag President Trump through the mud make him. The Mueller probe is a joke they don't have s*** on him they're just trying to drag it out as long as possible to try and make as many people leave the Trump Camp as possible. They are a bunch of lying thieving c********** who don't give a damn about anyone or anything but their own evil deceitful agenda.
Keep your head up President Trump! You‚Äôre the best president ever and we all know that. Who cares if those dam Dems smoked you tonight with their speeches. I don‚Äôt care if they made you look like a bumbling idiot in front Of Americans because I still love you and I know you‚Äôll make America great again! I‚Äôm your biggest fan!
Time to turn OFF the tv - your lying, pathetic ass is not welcome in my home!
Democrats, u wanted the job, polled for them, now build the wall get back to your jobs, we hired u for, build the wall deal with Trump later, I bet you'll see less drugs enter and kill millions of Americans.

President Trump 20172025 The Despicable democrats  will never  agree to protect Americans,  they have been ordered by their puppet masters  to obstruct you, daily,  If only some of the  3+ thousand indictments against the swamp  had been served, by now I believe  Americans would be  much safer,  I hope you demand that  first 10 billion for the wall  and border security  is  allocated  not just "promised" Then a balanced budget clause  and eliminate the  discretionary spending clause  must be approved , Do the  Despicable democrats  want a balanced budget, and smaller debt or do they want a massive debt making America's children and grandchildren  slaves to paying off the debt????  Also no more union dues  deducted  from the  government employees paycheck  force unions to use the  post office and send bills  out,   And there must be an easier way  to fire incompetent worthless government employees especially the redundant employees  and positions,  Hundreds of millions of Americans  support the wall and border security  Over 93%  so the Despicable democrats  can't play the "nobody wants the wall"  bullshit  anymore,  same with the world will end  if the shutdown  happens  No one  has noticed any change  in  life ,   Remember  seniors on Medicare who receive the average or near on social security must receive  100%coverage with no deductions from their social security check  they are depending on you,   Thank You God's speed and God bless America and your family   Keep in  mind the Despicable democrat menadez  threatened to go to court if you use the act of congress 1976  to build the wall,,   Imagine that menadez  is supposed to  go back to court on felony  charges  soon isn't  he???

It is important to Democrats to protect our borders, but that isn‚Äôt what your building a wall is all about. You have already broken your campaign promise by asking us to pay for it! A wall is useless! You are useless! Tonight as you make your address, sane America will be either tuning out, laughing at you, and yelling at their TV screens. You can‚Äôt win this. You are what you have always been, a waste of air and space. You are a LOSER!!!!
History shows Trump is a fucking liar.... According to him Mexico was going to build this wall.... Now American families are starving and tsa is very very weak in our airports where the real terrorist enter the country..... Pos
The Democrat apparatchiks won't even encourage Ruth Baeder Ginsburg to take care of her health. They are a cult. I wonder if when you visit them they'll even let you see your parents? In all eternity, Mrs. Ginsburg is going to live once on the earth, but in the name of Satan they want to exhaust every last ounce of energy for the greater good of Satan out of that poor nice lady.  I bet they would even get a body double for her, if they thought that they could get away with it. Look at Uranium One Mueller investigating people for the very thing he involved himself in. A body double for aging Supreme Court justices is not so far fetched. The Democrat party is going to be destroyed for 100 years, and by that time, we will have figured a way to make the world a good place.

Build the wall/barrier. Will add more jobs + all the money for material, labor, etc  put back into our economy.
Why don't you pay for if you want a fucking wall so bad asshole.
They only care about getting illegals for their voting block!  THEY WILL DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO GET YOU IN PRISON, AND WE WILL DO EVERYTHING TO KEEP THE BEST HEAD OF STATE IN POWER!  They think they can intimidate us and you!  The harder they push, the more we will push back!
Let's just tear down the gates these hypocritical bigot Democrats have their houses  in! WE DON'T GET OUR WALL, THEY DON'T GET THEIRS EITHER! NO WALL! NO PEACE!
I figure any American would want security. If anyone wants to come to this country than good let them in. However, do it the right way through a border to be screened. No telling how many people are coming through that are criminals. I feel anyone should be able to come to this country, but why would you want people just coming in waves that have the potential to bring more crime to your city.

Yes do it with technology and drones. A wall is useless. The majority of illegals over stay their visas and 90 percent of drugs come in through legal ports of entry by boat or plane so a wall will do nothing to secure our borders. It will significantly cause more damage though. Why would we want to spend trillions to get a false sense of security. That's as dumb as it can get.

Stand strong Mr President. Thankyou. Do not give up we need the wall and to rid our country of illegals .

The US has 325 million people and about 30.000 get killed by guns every year. Europe has 741 million people and only 1100 get killed by guns every year. (And according to you they have big problems with immigrants and violence) Think about that for a second‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Build the wall!  Don‚Äôt back down!  And no DACA!
Fire all them fuckers who dont support the president. Simple fix.
Open the government ! You big fat LIAR!
While everyone seems to be on the topic about the wall a bunch of people that I notice are hating on the idea so I am calling you out to answer this tell me do you lock you're doors when you go out? If so why? To keep unwanted intruders out of you're house? If so it is no different then keeping illegal immigrants out of the country. That need to come here legally if you all don't think we need a wall then you don't need locks on your house plain and simple.   Go on tell me i'm wrong I am waiting other then that I will be supporting the president of the united states that "we the people" elected after all we had to put up with Obama for 8 years you Liberals  can put up with Donald J. Trump for another 4 once he gets re elected in 2020.

You egotistical bully. A wall will not stop the influx of drugs from Mexico. Dealers have tunnels under the border that accommodate trucks and even trains. The few that have been discovered prove it. Every mile of new wall you build will bring more tunnels. Your wall cannot not secure the border. More and more people realize that with every lie you tell.
DON'T BACK DOWN MR. PRESIDENT!  WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK!  SICK OF IGNORANT LYING DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS!  ALL OF CONGRESS AND SENATE NEED TO BE DRUG TESTED!  üá∫üá∏GOD BLESS OUR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT!üá∫üá∏

mr. Trump you need to stand there at the border with your own gun and your cronies and try to stop trying to stop all the Hispanics to come to United States you got to remember history the Nina and the Pinta who were the first people here on this country and this continent it was the natives natives Americans the Apaches the Indians the Incas and all the other Indians that were raised and born here in United States we are not the only go aliens the ones that came here from the Pinta and the Santa Maria when they landed and found America remember you guys were from England you guys are the foreigners not the Mexicans and not the Indians so if you want to put a border put a border on your ass amen God Bless America the land of the natives and the Hispanics so take that to the bank
Paul Gonzales your just as ignorant as a black man crying about slavery. But I guess you think our civil war was about that majority? So forget about taxation without representation. Oh and forget about plains Indians that tried to live peacefully with the white men. One such group was the Sioux tribe. It was the largest and most powerful group in the west. They signed treaties with the government giving up ninety percent of their land. The Santee agreed to live in a small area. In exchange, the United States agreed to make yearly payments to the tribe. This made it possible for the Indians to buy food and other things from white traders.
You see, your only looking for a hand out. This no longer pertains to you.
Robert Decker well I kind of agree with you in one way or another but if you remember history who were the first people here in the United States before people from England landed and discovered America in about Civil War even black people fought against each other from the north to the South people are still killing each other doesn't matter if you're black white yellow green purple or rainbow color people still are killing each other so we either got to get along with each other we are the ones that are killing each other the engines knew nothing about alcohol until the Americans traded them alcohol for their beads and Furs and blankets and their women got to remember we're all from the same father the same mother think about it we all came from Adam and Eve God made Adam first took a rib from Adam and made Eve so there was a first really people in the world their children are descendants of us so we each got to either get along or stay away from each other God bless you all take care of the United States because it belongs to everybody not just bigots it's not our world as gods made in seven days and seven nights he can destroy it and nothing flat the snap of a finger week of a die guns don't kill people people kill people so let's get along God bless you all
Robert Decker I'm sorry the only time I've ever asked for a handout is what I went to a food bank when I didn't have enough money I paid 900 almost $1,000 Way live and I only get 1265 so I don't go asking for handouts don't need to God provides if you believe

So......if Americans want border security why don't they bring all the US troops home who are out threatening border security of other countries in  the world, use the money they spend supporting insurgencies and corruption to guard the US border with Mexico?  Trumpy doesn't seem to be too worried about all the drugs and illegals who are entering the US through the 340 Port of Entries though.

Janet Lee you are so full of hate.
Rebecca Thomsen Koskey yes ma'am thank you for pointing that out! I absolutely hate when my country is raped and pillaged and destroyed by a traitor. And I'm sorry for you that you are not. But you see, we all are not conned and we are not easily bought for a temporary tax break and a handful of empty promises. I've known who Donald Trump is since 1980. You're soon going to find out who you put in the White House. Your denial of it does not make it any less true.
Rebecca Thomsen Koskey aren't you even curious to read the article? A little too much Truth for you huh? Scary words like the Supreme Court and judges and lawyers and facts. Yes, facts. You know those things that your Lord and Master is allergic to? Hold on to your hat honey and make sure that your Depends undergarments are fastened securely from here on out. Because it's about to hit the fan royally.

Narcissistic personality disorder ‚Äî one of several types of personality disorders ‚Äî is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.

Most left now without a job, a destroyed industry but a shining big wall which has thousands of little tunnels beneath it. THE END

Federal workers on Furlough.....Do not give in.....Stand Strong Donald J. Trump Vets for Trump Why would you support someone not paying you.....hmmm.....That is because you are a true American and also served your country. Civilians have no concept of what freedom cost and want to whine about you or I not getting paid when in reality ,WE WILLINGLY go without pay because it is the right thing for the people and America first. We get our money back paid, they also do not know there are Emergency Relief funds available if you get bound up and need to get money, also when offered the job you sign a contract knowing you will work without pay if this happens. Americans want the freedoms United States provides as long as someone else is willing to provide them at no cost to them. They fear Gov. shutdown must be affecting their lives in some way because Democrats are telling them it is. Well it is, they are being led astray for open boarders, which is against our own countries laws to support. Another it is us We the people who care for the illegals. Our money , we earn for OUR Family is taken from us to care for them. The more that come into the country the more it cost and Democrats want more to come over 500,000. On average $18.00 a day per illegal in the country. In fact, illegal immigration costs taxpayers a staggering $134.9 billion a year while contributing only $19 billion in state, federal, and local taxes. At the federal level, medical costs make up the lion‚Äôs share of government expenditures on illegal immigrants, while education is the largest single expense that illegal immigration imposes on state and local governments. Sadly, an overloaded welfare state is not the only negative side-effect of our broken immigration system. Communities across America are also being devastated by the violent crime and drug trafficking that result from our failure to control the border ‚Äî an issue Donald Trump has addressed repeatedly and emphatically ever since he first announced his candidacy for president.Millions of dollars a day and more every day and Democrats say send them on,  our American Citizens will pay for more. Thank US the Democrat with your vote... Republicans did not want you. They wanted to put the American People FIRST. How RUDE...

President Trump you are the man to get this done, you have the unique combination of skills, compassion, courage, and understanding to make America Great Again. We the People are with you and the Democrats are not, they have become something unrecognizable. Only the inside the beltway demons don't like the term "wall". We need a physical wall and technological barrier and increased border agents across the entire 2000 miles of our southern border. This is a national emergency and the polls are very likely incorrectly reporting the numbers of Americans that want the wall.

Sure, border security !!! But that does not necessarily mean a 5 billion dollar wall !!! The Democrats also want border security ... but not the 5 billion dollar wall that you are proposing for border security !!! You need to learn how to negotiate and compromise !!! You are used to bullying until you get your own way !!! You have no respect or consideration for the other people with whom you are negotiating !!! You are 71 but you act like a child who hasn‚Äôt learned that he cannot always have his own way !!! You need to grow up !!! I hope the Democrats don‚Äôt let you get away with your bullying ways so that you may learn how to be a mature individual !!! Otherwise you need to be removed from circulation because people like you are a menace and not worthy of living in society with other people ...

The only ones who want to build a wall are the people who have a evil demonic and hateful lives, hearts and mind! All those who have been to wars who had participated in killing others in other countries,who are blood guilty from all the wars the US has cause thru out the years. So they live in fear of their own demonic Karma
Build the wall...
Democrats are cockroaches.
President Trump, it is our hope that you will not budge one inch with regard to "Building the Wall".  We all know you cannot negotiate with Democrats, as 'it is their way or the highway'.  We MUST HAVE A WALL to keep ILLEGAL DRUG DEALERS, TERRORISTS, AND ASSORTED PREGNANT IMMIGRANTS, WHO THINK THAT IF THEY ARE ABLE TO ENTER THIS COUNTRY VIA PREGNANCY, OR DRAGGING THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN FROM GUATEMALA TO MEXICO, UNDER THE GUISE OF BEING GOOD PARENTS, REVEALS THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS DON"T CARE ONE WHIT ABOUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.  WE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT OUR COUNTRY SECURE, AND THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THIS IS TO BUILD A WALL THAT THEY CANNOT SCALE.  A BORDER CROSSING FENCE WILL NOT WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATE TO LEAVE THEIR IMPOVERISHED COUNTRIES (WHY DON'T THE DEMOCRATS

There is no border emergency.  There is only a megalomaniac sexual predator in the White House.
You're such a jackass. Stop embarassing yourself and resign.
I hope the impeachment process works. You don‚Äôt care about the citizens or you would end the shut down. You said you would block funding for California wild fires... how is that caring about the safety of your country? Come February you‚Äôll be starving over 38 million Americans, predominantly children, how is that caring about the safety of your citizens? You‚Äôre willing to allow millions of low income families to become homeless. How is that caring about anyone‚Äôs safety besides your own bullheadedness? You won‚Äôt be homeless, you will continue to eat, you will continue getting paid while all your workers continue to be furloughed or work for no pay. You don‚Äôt know struggle. You‚Äôve been a rich kid your whole life. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre so okay with letting others suffer if it gets you your way. You won‚Äôt go hungry and neither will your children. You won‚Äôt risk homeless because you have no money due to HUD running out of funds or no paycheck for an extended period of time.  You‚Äôre a disgrace and I fully support your impeachment!
BUILD THE WALL......... WHEN YOU DON'T BECOME A CITIZEN  YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY PUDDING HOW CAN YOU HAVE ANY PUDDING IF YOU DON'T EAT YOUR MEAT.?
Illegal border crossings are at a 40 year low, more than 60% of all undocumented immigrants are here because they overstated a valid visa, and most of the illegal drugs come through monitored points of entry. There is no need for your vanity project!
the drugs don,t just come in at the entry way. drug cartels go through the deserta mountains. guess yo never hiked anywhere. they use  glass to shine when they spot someone to let them know change course. some places you can,t hike anymore cartels will kille you you don,t hear this on fake news. Get real We Need The Border. Dec23 Chucky said he wanted to stop all negoations till peloski took over. so its chucky shutdown Its Not Stupid To Shutdown The Gov. Have Sone Comon Sense. There Scared There Cash Cow Will Dry Out Plain And Simple. Bless This Country. Trump Keep Strong Don,t Back Down
Where are the pesos?  Your decision to shut down the government is hurting 800,000 Americans - and their families.  This is IMMORAL.  Your decision is IMMORAL.  I watched you state you would be happy to shut down the government. I watched you clearly state you would own and be accountable for the shutdown.  I watched this on live TV - no ‚Äúfake news‚Äù spin.  You are clearly trying to bully - and using 800,000 Americans and their families as pawns, as bargaining chips.  Why?  ... because you need to ‚Äúlook strong‚Äù?  .... because you need to look like ‚Äúa winner‚Äù?  You asked Pelosi if she would agree to a wall in 30 days if you opened the government. She said no and you will keep the government shut down.  You are clearly holding 800,000 Americans and their families hostage.  THIS IS IMMORAL.  You are putting your need to look strong to your minority base and extreme right media personalities ahead of the negative impacts to our fellow citizens.  No real leader places their personal need ahead of the American people.  CAN YOU ACT LIKE A REAL LEADER BY PUTTING 800,000 AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES AHEAD OF YOUR PETTY PERSONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS?
CRIMINAL'S ARE WANTING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY, OUR PEOPLE.  DEALING DEADLY DRUG'S TO ANYONE.  OUR LIVE'S ARE OF NO VALUE TO THEM.  OUR CHILDREN ARE OF NO VALUE TO THEM.

Katie Curran I guess your not paying attention. Ford motors is now not going to build trucks or truck parts in Mexico. They are moving those jobs to the USA. It's a multiple billion dollar deal. Yep they are paying for the wall
Mike Stoumbaugh you must not understand how paying works. Our tax money is going to build the wall. If there is more American business we should use that money to lower my taxes.

Cadet Bone Spurs, who is likely barely literate (certainly from a written and, likely, reading point of view), took to the TV air waves tonight in a speech dripping with malice, xenophobia, and fear-mongering.

Archival photos would likely have shown him going home after a "hard day at the office" (murdering people?...which his policies have already done and are doing!) with a big smile on his face as he played with little Donnie, Eric, and Ivanka...training them in his devious, uncaring techniques. This man is barely human. This wilfully-ignorant and stupid individual is a disgusting waste of flabby human skin.  His PINHEADS continuing to support him at this late date speaks volumes about them, doesn't it?

The only promises you need to keep are TO YOURSELF.  So KEEP THEM TO YOURSELF,  Donny Douchebag.
Just tell them you built a new invisible force field.  Your dumb ass supporters will believe anything you say.
Build the wall.keep your promises president trump democrats are traitors of oath
Security is very important! then build that wall 35 feet high at both borders since most terrorist threats come from Canada #MAGA if not high and on both borders, then do not build it. Also let your supporters help build or donate like the Statue of Liberty
The fact that this idiot shares Fox News articles as facts should tell you everything you need to know about him.
Yes, Americans and democrats in congress want border security, higher technology, more personnel at the border to process immigrants. "Your" wall will not hinder those trafficking heroin.  It is smuggled in CARS AND OTHER VEHICLES THAT COME THROUGH LEGAL PORTS OF ENTRY, or through a network of sophisticated underground tunnels.   "Your" wall will do nothing to stop the flow of heroin, traffickers do NOT walk on foot with their cargo across the border, you idiot.  And only idiots will believe you on this.  Your address was full of mistruths, most know that.
Donald trump is an asshole
If it hasn't happened by now it's not going to happen...
Donald trump is an asshole
Narcissistic personality disorder ‚Äî one of several types of personality disorders ‚Äî is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.
OMG..I'm drunk.  Should never have played Border Wall Bingo or taken a shot each time #fatnixon lied.  11 minutes of lies and fear mongering.  If you really care about US citizens what about the ones killed by a US citizen, domestic terrorist at Parkland High School?  The majority of illegal immigrants arrive by plane and overstay their Visas, they don't cross our southern border. The wall doesn't fix that   And according to the DEA - 90% of illegal drugs cross at established border crossings  Your wall doesn't fix that.  #itmfa  #borderwallbingo  #trumplies  #mexicowillpay  #wallfail
If you trying to destroy the border of other country,how could you save border of country?! Let others then you will be calm.
America is at a HUGE RISK of terrorism because of the #TrumpShutdown . We do not need a wall-we already HAVE ‚ñ∫ 654 miles of border fencing. The Rio Grande is along the border-you can't fence that. Most of the property is owned by individuals STILL fighting Obama era eminent domain claims to keep their land from being seized. THERE IS NO PLAN for a wall. Trump/GOP can fund the government, keep us safe, and put Americans back to work while they figure out what they even want to do!! Trump says it's concrete, then it's steel slats, etc. You need PLANS before you ask for billions of dollars, ffs!  MORE FACTS-----  ‚ñ∫Most undocumented immigrants don‚Äôt ‚Äúsneak‚Äù across the border.  The majority of immigrants in the USA without authorization first entered the country legally, and then overstayed their visas. The Center for Migration Studies said in a 2017 report that crossing the border is not the way ‚Äúthe large majority of persons now becoming undocumented.‚Äù It reported that two-thirds of undocumented immigrants entered the U.S. legally and then simply overstayed their visas. If you legitimately are concerned about the issue of undocumented immigrants, as opposed to just exacerbating and exploiting fearmongering for political gain, then this is where you would focus ‚Äî not the border.  ‚ñ∫Drugs entering the USA across the southern border are most often hidden in legal shipments.  Trump has suggested that the flow of heroin into the United States would be stanched by his border wall. He‚Äôs right that 90 percent of heroin enters through the southern border. However, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency, ‚Äúillicit drugs are smuggled into the United States in concealed compartments within passenger vehicles or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers.‚Äù  In other words, a wall wouldn‚Äôt stop most heroin from entering the country. And arguably, resources spent on the wall would divert from other enforcement mechanisms, such as more officers and technology at ports of entry to scan vehicles for drugs.    It‚Äôs also noteworthy that in ramping up prosecution of migrants trying to enter the United States, the Trump administration actually reduced prosecution of drug traffickers. Last June saw the fewest such prosecutions in two decades.    ‚ñ∫Illegal border crossings are down. Significantly.  In 2000, 1.6 million people were apprehended trying to cross the southern border into the United States. In 2001, 1.3 million were apprehended. In 2018? Less than 400,000. That‚Äôs not just a decline. It‚Äôs a significant decline.  ‚ñ∫The counties along the southern border are among the safest in the United States.  According to data from the Wilson Center, as summarized by The Washington Post, ‚ÄúThe crime rates in U.S. border counties are lower than the average for similarly sized inland counties, with two exceptions out of 23 total.‚Äù  ‚ñ∫The White House is lying about terrorists crossing the southern border.  In an interview on Fox News this weekend, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders insisted that ‚Äúnearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.‚Äù Sanders' careful wording suggests she knew she was more than bending the truth. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace fact-checked Sanders: ‚ÄúDo you know where those 4,000 people come, where they are captured? Airports.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe state department says there hasn‚Äôt been any terrorists found coming across the southern border,‚Äù Wallace stated. But Sanders kept pressing the lie, because Trump‚Äôs anti-immigrant agenda relies on fact-less fearmongering.  ‚ñ∫Migrant caravans aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsneaking‚Äù across the border, either.  If you care about facts, it‚Äôs important to distinguish between illegal border crossings and migrants lawfully presenting themselves at southern ports of entry in order to apply for asylum. The simple fact is that large groups of very visible migrants, such as the main so-called migrant caravan of people fleeing violence in Central America, are obviously not trying to ‚Äúsneak‚Äù across the U.S. border.

Democrats protect the illegal alien while murdering the unborn!
BUILD A WALL FROM WHAT ????? America's debt is the largest sovereign debt in the world for a single country. The debt is greater than what America produces in a whole year. This high debt-to-gross domestic product ratio tells investors that the country will for the first time have problems repaying the loans. That's a new and worrying occurrence for the United States.
The invasion is okay though when you hire illegal immigrants to work for you. Resign you fat, orange con.
More important than you Mr. President for the anti Americans democrats morons is to show their frustration and disgusting disrespect to our country and to you because they are a bunch of idiots airheads
Create a huge, giant crater along the border üí£ Oops  Mass Deportation Now!  Close our borders completely and permanently.   Immigration laws need to be enforced on every level.   Get them out of our jails, our prisons, our courts, our schools and our country.   They should be stopped at the border by any means necessary.   Enough already.   GET IT DONE.
Angela Harris I agree,  and I see it all the time with our schools
You blowhard. You flat out said no when 25 billion was offered because you pandered to your swamp. You never negotiated anything. You effing blew it.
i got a question. Mr. President Donald Thrump has been called a Mother  Fucker. ...But  has the Presidento of Mexico every been called that..the people fled here for safety so if you are going to cuss somebody wouldn't be the Presidento of Mexico..Would she the congress woman call him that cuss word..  There was a woman elected in mexico shot down because of trying to help her country.  what would happened to,this lady that called Mr President of America that cuss word to the Mexico Presidento.  Is she a good example to the children..teaching disrespect to political figures of very high rank..
We don‚Äôt want shiiiiitt we want to get paid we want you to stop thinking you are head of a dictatorship and understand this is a democracy we want you to respect immigrants and understand you and your wife are children of immigrant we all are immigrants some more willing than others but unless you are an Indian we are all here uninvited
What a low life. what all rules & laws  for your peasants and not for you? a blue wave is coming in 2020, then we're gonna lock you up! crooked dirty Donny. make America great again and resign.
All of you that think a wall will stop illegal immigration have minimal understanding of the issue. Over 90% of all undocumented/illegal immigrants came here with valid visas and never left when they expired. Please explain to me how a wall will stop that? Also if the wall is to stop illegal immigration, why isnt one being placed along the northern border? More people enter that way than they do from the south.
Build the wall deport ALL illegals just load them all up and dump them where they came from. And take their kids with them
Fooling your 33% of idiots

Democrats protect the illegal alien while murdering the unborn!
America is at a HUGE RISK of terrorism because of the #TrumpShutdown . We do not need a wall-we already HAVE ‚ñ∫ 654 miles of border fencing. The Rio Grande is along the border-you can't fence that. Most of the property is owned by individuals STILL fighting Obama era eminent domain claims to keep their land from being seized. THERE IS NO PLAN for a wall. Trump/GOP can fund the government, keep us safe, and put Americans back to work while they figure out what they even want to do!! Trump says it's concrete, then it's steel slats, etc. You need PLANS before you ask for billions of dollars, ffs!  MORE FACTS-----  ‚ñ∫Most undocumented immigrants don‚Äôt ‚Äúsneak‚Äù across the border.  The majority of immigrants in the USA without authorization first entered the country legally, and then overstayed their visas. The Center for Migration Studies said in a 2017 report that crossing the border is not the way ‚Äúthe large majority of persons now becoming undocumented.‚Äù It reported that two-thirds of undocumented immigrants entered the U.S. legally and then simply overstayed their visas. If you legitimately are concerned about the issue of undocumented immigrants, as opposed to just exacerbating and exploiting fearmongering for political gain, then this is where you would focus ‚Äî not the border.  ‚ñ∫Drugs entering the USA across the southern border are most often hidden in legal shipments.  Trump has suggested that the flow of heroin into the United States would be stanched by his border wall. He‚Äôs right that 90 percent of heroin enters through the southern border. However, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency, ‚Äúillicit drugs are smuggled into the United States in concealed compartments within passenger vehicles or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers.‚Äù  In other words, a wall wouldn‚Äôt stop most heroin from entering the country. And arguably, resources spent on the wall would divert from other enforcement mechanisms, such as more officers and technology at ports of entry to scan vehicles for drugs.    It‚Äôs also noteworthy that in ramping up prosecution of migrants trying to enter the United States, the Trump administration actually reduced prosecution of drug traffickers. Last June saw the fewest such prosecutions in two decades.    ‚ñ∫Illegal border crossings are down. Significantly.  In 2000, 1.6 million people were apprehended trying to cross the southern border into the United States. In 2001, 1.3 million were apprehended. In 2018? Less than 400,000. That‚Äôs not just a decline. It‚Äôs a significant decline.  ‚ñ∫The counties along the southern border are among the safest in the United States.  According to data from the Wilson Center, as summarized by The Washington Post, ‚ÄúThe crime rates in U.S. border counties are lower than the average for similarly sized inland counties, with two exceptions out of 23 total.‚Äù  ‚ñ∫The White House is lying about terrorists crossing the southern border.  In an interview on Fox News this weekend, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders insisted that ‚Äúnearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.‚Äù Sanders' careful wording suggests she knew she was more than bending the truth. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace fact-checked Sanders: ‚ÄúDo you know where those 4,000 people come, where they are captured? Airports.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe state department says there hasn‚Äôt been any terrorists found coming across the southern border,‚Äù Wallace stated. But Sanders kept pressing the lie, because Trump‚Äôs anti-immigrant agenda relies on fact-less fearmongering.  ‚ñ∫Migrant caravans aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsneaking‚Äù across the border, either.  If you care about facts, it‚Äôs important to distinguish between illegal border crossings and migrants lawfully presenting themselves at southern ports of entry in order to apply for asylum. The simple fact is that large groups of very visible migrants, such as the main so-called migrant caravan of people fleeing violence in Central America, are obviously not trying to ‚Äúsneak‚Äù across the U.S. border. They‚Äôre coming to the border to apply for asylum, which was a completely transparent and lawful process until Trump started changing the rules.    ‚ñ∫Conservative political figures and think tanks think Trump‚Äôs wall is pointless.  What apparently began as a memory device to help the undisciplined Trump remember what to thunder about during campaign appearances has turned into a central bone the president won‚Äôt let go of. But there‚Äôs a reason Trump couldn‚Äôt get funding for his wall during the past two years of his presidency when his own party completely controlled both houses of Congress: They didn‚Äôt want it. The New York Times reports that leading anti-immigration activists are concerned Trump‚Äôs focus on the ‚Äúrelatively ineffectual‚Äù wall is distracting from other strategies they would like prioritized.  ‚ñ∫There are already 654 miles of border fencing.  The U.S.-Mexico border is 1,933 miles long. Of that, 34 percent already has a wall or a fence ‚Äî in particular, parts along the areas of the border that are most easily accessed by people traveling by car or on foot. That‚Äôs right, there‚Äôs already a wall along 654 miles of the U.S. border. What‚Äôs the rest? Huge mountains and rivers and vast stretches of land that are privately owned, which the United States would have to seize through eminent domain if Trump got his way. Mind you, those areas aren‚Äôt completely open ‚Äî they‚Äôre actively patrolled using sensors and drones and other technology, the sorts of things experts say actually work.

If you trying to destroy the border of other country,how could you save border of country?! Let others then you will be calm.
OMG..I'm drunk.  Should never have played Border Wall Bingo or taken a shot each time #fatnixon lied.  11 minutes of lies and fear mongering.  If you really care about US citizens what about the ones killed by a US citizen, domestic terrorist at Parkland High School?  The majority of illegal immigrants arrive by plane and overstay their Visas, they don't cross our southern border. The wall doesn't fix that   And according to the DEA - 90% of illegal drugs cross at established border crossings  Your wall doesn't fix that.  #itmfa  #borderwallbingo  #trumplies  #mexicowillpay  #wallfail
Angela Harris I agree,  and I see it all the time with our schools
You can get arrested for hunting and fishing without a license, why are the illegals allowed to work and stay in America without being cleared. And schools that are run by tax payer money should have to verify that the parents of enrolling children are here legally. You would be shocked how many children are entering our schools.

Narcissistic personality disorder ‚Äî one of several types of personality disorders ‚Äî is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.
Yes, Americans and democrats in congress want border security, higher technology, more personnel at the border to process immigrants. "Your" wall will not hinder those trafficking heroin.  It is smuggled in CARS AND OTHER VEHICLES THAT COME THROUGH LEGAL PORTS OF ENTRY, or through a network of sophisticated underground tunnels.   "Your" wall will do nothing to stop the flow of heroin, traffickers do NOT walk on foot with their cargo across the border, you idiot.  And only idiots will believe you on this.  Your address was full of mistruths, most know that.
The fact that this idiot shares Fox News articles as facts should tell you everything you need to know about him.
Security is very important! then build that wall 35 feet high at both borders since most terrorist threats come from Canada #MAGA if not high and on both borders, then do not build it. Also let your supporters help build or donate like the Statue of Liberty
Build the wall.keep your promises president trump democrats are traitors of oath
Just tell them you built a new invisible force field.  Your dumb ass supporters will believe anything you say.
The only promises you need to keep are TO YOURSELF.  So KEEP THEM TO YOURSELF,  Donny Douchebag.

It costs the US like $750/day to house those under 18 and now they number over 10,000 a month since November jumping border. Then theres another 40,000 adults a month since November costing not much less. This all about New California Governor Newsom wants all of California to be a Sanctuary State and have Illegals be given free health care and California House leader Pelosi wants holes in the fence. Its simple. It‚Äôs their con job. Even Angus King doesn‚Äôt get how or why Pelosi is calling a barrier ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù. It‚Äôs there Pelosi loses the public opinion poll. Pelosi is keeping gov closed. Nothing has reached the President‚Äôs desk to even sign or not. Hello ! And include Democratic California Rep. Eric Swalwell as today he says too a steel fence is ‚Äúimmoral ‚Äú. So a California House leader Pelosi and a California Congressman Swalwell is in a sceme with California Governor Newsom to keep border unsecured and are willing to keep government closed to achieve their goal. Got it ! Trump making money for more detention beds yet these people know they‚Äôll only be detained for 20 days then released. That‚Äôs a no brainer.

Trump's a billionare. why tf cant he pay for his own damn wall. how u gonna be a multi billion dollar name like trump and u cant even pay for this wall cheap ass penny pinching, pocket stealing, nickle and diming ass mother fucker
When Trump says the southern border situation is a national emergency, what he really has in mind is a Trump emergency. He's the boy who cried wolf. He would send our war fighters to the border to start building a wall so Ann Coulter will be nice to him again.  "The basic factory setting on the perception of Trump is: gigantic douchebag. This is a man who manufactured fake Time magazine covers featuring himself with the headline, "Donald Trump: The 'Apprentice' is a television smash!" so that he could put framed copies of it on the walls of his clubs.  His business is convincing people with lowbrow taste to give him their money." http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2018-12-19.html

Hold the line Mr. President we need a border wall. These Democrats voted for it before you could see this is all politics. They do not care about the American citizen all they care about is illegal immigrants
We should seek, to Expulse the congress members, in the way. All it takes is a concurrence of two-thirds, to expel a congress member from congress. Start with Chuck, then the two muslins, who did not swear in on a holy bible. Can we leave the wing nut socialism girl, she is really cute and very funny.

Lower and middle class people don¬¥t have one penny more in their pocket, but rich people got tax cuts !!! Great work of the orange CLOWN !!

Trump is very poor con man.

Democrats say the border is not the main problem.  People overstaying their visas are.  DEMOCRATS won't let ICE apprehend these illegal visa overstayers.

We want you gone TRAITOR. Move to Russia. Where you belong. Putin will give his best BOY(you) a shiny Hero of Russia medal.
All the Democrats want is to destroy everything this country stands for. It started with statues and now it's the real Patriots. We are locked and loaded Mr President and ready to shoot and a moments notice. We Are Sick and Tired of The Liberal Snow Flakes. It is time for people to go.

They don't like you. My daughter is a liberal & I can't talk with her about reasonable politics & law for more than 2 minutes before she goes ballistic - citing all the money that's been stolen from Americans, and how the big corps. are taking over the world, etc.  She can't see that letting all these illegals in will harm us - she's sees pie-in-the-sky.
A NATIONAL EMERGENCY WILL BE DECLARED TONIGHT AND MONEY WILL BE APPROPRIATED FOR THE WALL TO SECURE ONCE AND FOR ALL OUR SOUTHERN SICK BORDER. MEXICO 3RD WORLD COUNTRY HAS NOT HELPED US ONE BIT TO SECURE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. THEY ARE THE PROBLEM. IF THEY WANT TO BECOME AMERICANS, BE VETTED AT OUR PORTS OF ENTRY. NO MORE SNEAKING IN ILLEGALLY AS CRIMINALS.
Janet Williams  HO YOU DUMBASS FUCKING tiny dicked trump?

Katie Curran I guess your not paying attention. Ford motors is now not going to build trucks or truck parts in Mexico. They are moving those jobs to the USA. It's a multiple billion dollar deal. Yep they are paying for the wall
YOU AREN'T FULFILLING YOUR PROMISE!! YOU SAID MEXICO WOULD PAY. NOW YOU WANT AMERICAN MONEY TO PAY.  YOU ARE A LIAR!!
the drugs don,t just come in at the entry way. drug cartels go through the deserta mountains. guess yo never hiked anywhere. they use  glass to shine when they spot someone to let them know change course. some places you can,t hike anymore cartels will kille you you don,t hear this on fake news. Get real We Need The Border. Dec23 Chucky said he wanted to stop all negoations till peloski took over. so its chucky shutdown Its Not Stupid To Shutdown The Gov. Have Sone Comon Sense. There Scared There Cash Cow Will Dry Out Plain And Simple. Bless This Country. Trump Keep Strong Don,t Back Down
Illegal border crossings are at a 40 year low, more than 60% of all undocumented immigrants are here because they overstated a valid visa, and most of the illegal drugs come through monitored points of entry. There is no need for your vanity project!
ALL AMERICANS STAND UP AND FIGHT WITH OUR PRESIDENT VOTE FOR OUR PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP 2020 TO DEFEAT THESE SO CALL DEMOCRATS ONCE AND FOR ALL LETS GET TOGETHER AND TAKE THESE DEMOCRATS DOWN.THEY ARE STUPID AND IDIOTS THEY NEED TO GET REAM OUT.

BUILD THE WALL......... WHEN YOU DON'T BECOME A CITIZEN  YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY PUDDING HOW CAN YOU HAVE ANY PUDDING IF YOU DON'T EAT YOUR MEAT.?
I hope the impeachment process works. You don‚Äôt care about the citizens or you would end the shut down. You said you would block funding for California wild fires... how is that caring about the safety of your country? Come February you‚Äôll be starving over 38 million Americans, predominantly children, how is that caring about the safety of your citizens? You‚Äôre willing to allow millions of low income families to become homeless. How is that caring about anyone‚Äôs safety besides your own bullheadedness? You won‚Äôt be homeless, you will continue to eat, you will continue getting paid while all your workers continue to be furloughed or work for no pay. You don‚Äôt know struggle. You‚Äôve been a rich kid your whole life. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre so okay with letting others suffer if it gets you your way. You won‚Äôt go hungry and neither will your children. You won‚Äôt risk homeless because you have no money due to HUD running out of funds or no paycheck for an extended period of time.  You‚Äôre a disgrace and I fully support your impeachment!
The majority of Americans hate you and would rather see you gone, that's what the latest poll's suggest...You're the worst president ever. You support the terrorist STATE of ISRAEL and the terrorist kingdom of Saudi Arabia

President Trump, it is our hope that you will not budge one inch with regard to "Building the Wall".  We all know you cannot negotiate with Democrats, as 'it is their way or the highway'.  We MUST HAVE A WALL to keep ILLEGAL DRUG DEALERS, TERRORISTS, AND ASSORTED PREGNANT IMMIGRANTS, WHO THINK THAT IF THEY ARE ABLE TO ENTER THIS COUNTRY VIA PREGNANCY, OR DRAGGING THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN FROM GUATEMALA TO MEXICO, UNDER THE GUISE OF BEING GOOD PARENTS, REVEALS THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS DON"T CARE ONE WHIT ABOUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.  WE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT OUR COUNTRY SECURE, AND THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THIS IS TO BUILD A WALL THAT THEY CANNOT SCALE.  A BORDER CROSSING FENCE WILL NOT WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATE TO LEAVE THEIR IMPOVERISHED COUNTRIES (WHY DON'T THE DEMOCRATS
Democrats are cockroaches.
Build the wall...
The only ones who want to build a wall are the people who have a evil demonic and hateful lives, hearts and mind! All those who have been to wars who had participated in killing others in other countries,who are blood guilty from all the wars the US has cause thru out the years. So they live in fear of their own demonic Karma

Sure, border security !!! But that does not necessarily mean a 5 billion dollar wall !!! The Democrats also want border security ... but not the 5 billion dollar wall that you are proposing for border security !!! You need to learn how to negotiate and compromise !!! You are used to bullying until you get your own way !!! You have no respect or consideration for the other people with whom you are negotiating !!! You are 71 but you act like a child who hasn‚Äôt learned that he cannot always have his own way !!! You need to grow up !!! I hope the Democrats don‚Äôt let you get away with your bullying ways so that you may learn how to be a mature individual !!! Otherwise you need to be removed from circulation because people like you are a menace and not worthy of living in society with other people ...

President Trump you are the man to get this done, you have the unique combination of skills, compassion, courage, and understanding to make America Great Again. We the People are with you and the Democrats are not, they have become something unrecognizable. Only the inside the beltway demons don't like the term "wall". We need a physical wall and technological barrier and increased border agents across the entire 2000 miles of our southern border. This is a national emergency and the polls are very likely incorrectly reporting the numbers of Americans that want the wall.

Brian Cudmore well since your so smart come up with that great plan and present it
So......if Americans want border security why don't they bring all the US troops home who are out threatening border security of other countries in  the world, use the money they spend supporting insurgencies and corruption to guard the US border with Mexico?  Trumpy doesn't seem to be too worried about all the drugs and illegals who are entering the US through the 340 Port of Entries though.

You see, your only looking for a hand out. This no longer pertains to you.
Paul Gonzales your just as ignorant as a black man crying about slavery. But I guess you think our civil war was about that majority? So forget about taxation without representation. Oh and forget about plains Indians that tried to live peacefully with the white men. One such group was the Sioux tribe. It was the largest and most powerful group in the west. They signed treaties with the government giving up ninety percent of their land. The Santee agreed to live in a small area. In exchange, the United States agreed to make yearly payments to the tribe. This made it possible for the Indians to buy food and other things from white traders.
mr. Trump you need to stand there at the border with your own gun and your cronies and try to stop trying to stop all the Hispanics to come to United States you got to remember history the Nina and the Pinta who were the first people here on this country and this continent it was the natives natives Americans the Apaches the Indians the Incas and all the other Indians that were raised and born here in United States we are not the only go aliens the ones that came here from the Pinta and the Santa Maria when they landed and found America remember you guys were from England you guys are the foreigners not the Mexicans and not the Indians so if you want to put a border put a border on your ass amen God Bless America the land of the natives and the Hispanics so take that to the bank

You egotistical bully. A wall will not stop the influx of drugs from Mexico. Dealers have tunnels under the border that accommodate trucks and even trains. The few that have been discovered prove it. Every mile of new wall you build will bring more tunnels. Your wall cannot not secure the border. More and more people realize that with every lie you tell.

While everyone seems to be on the topic about the wall a bunch of people that I notice are hating on the idea so I am calling you out to answer this tell me do you lock you're doors when you go out? If so why? To keep unwanted intruders out of you're house? If so it is no different then keeping illegal immigrants out of the country. That need to come here legally if you all don't think we need a wall then you don't need locks on your house plain and simple.   Go on tell me i'm wrong I am waiting other then that I will be supporting the president of the united states that "we the people" elected after all we had to put up with Obama for 8 years you Liberals  can put up with Donald J. Trump for another 4 once he gets re elected in 2020.

Yes do it with technology and drones. A wall is useless. The majority of illegals over stay their visas and 90 percent of drugs come in through legal ports of entry by boat or plane so a wall will do nothing to secure our borders. It will significantly cause more damage though. Why would we want to spend trillions to get a false sense of security. That's as dumb as it can get.
We support our POTUS!  Stand firm President Trump!  Build the wall.  The dimowits care only for illegal invaders and obstruction.  The American people stand with President Trump.

The Democrat apparatchiks won't even encourage Ruth Baeder Ginsburg to take care of her health. They are a cult. I wonder if when you visit them they'll even let you see your parents? In all eternity, Mrs. Ginsburg is going to live once on the earth, but in the name of Satan they want to exhaust every last ounce of energy for the greater good of Satan out of that poor nice lady.  I bet they would even get a body double for her, if they thought that they could get away with it. Look at Uranium One Mueller investigating people for the very thing he involved himself in. A body double for aging Supreme Court justices is not so far fetched. The Democrat party is going to be destroyed for 100 years, and by that time, we will have figured a way to make the world a good place. Democrat proof.  ~ Dark Cloud Society of Light   Then spake Solomon, YAHOVAH said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. I Kings 8:12
President Trump has repeatedly overstated the severity of illegal immigration at the southern border in order to convince Congress to approve more than $5 billion in funding for a border wall. Government data shows that arrests are down at the border compared with the Obama administration as most illegal immigration occurs when people overstay their temporary visas. During fiscal 2017, the Department of Homeland Security found that the number of immigrants that overstayed their visas was more than double those apprehended at the border during the same time frame.

It is important to Democrats to protect our borders, but that isn‚Äôt what your building a wall is all about. You have already broken your campaign promise by asking us to pay for it! A wall is useless! You are useless! Tonight as you make your address, sane America will be either tuning out, laughing at you, and yelling at their TV screens. You can‚Äôt win this.

To destroy USA, the fastest way is to let drugs flows into the borders. Let the drugs flow in.  Like the opium war of China.  It totally destroyed China.  Read the opium war history.  And see how right POTUS is.

You guys all make very good points. Let's keep up the good work and support our president. If we need to, that's even march on the capitol. The lazy ass Democrats and socialist liberal assholes are out working us as far as really making a stand. We need to March we need to protest we need to shut the government all the way down if we have to. All the Democrats care about is trying to drag President Trump through the mud make him. The Mueller probe is a joke they don't have s*** on him they're just trying to drag it out as long as possible to try and make as many people leave the Trump Camp as possible. They are a bunch of lying thieving c********** who don't give a damn about anyone or anything but their own evil deceitful agenda.
Expose the dirt on these politicians!!!! They will be singing a different tune then!!! BUILD THE WALL!!! GOD will prevail!!!
Democrats should come to their senses and work with the President. American people are sick and tired with the crooked politicians. Americans want security, honesty and hard work to MAGA......
Ohh Kevin you are such an idiot. There is no help for you. You will just die stupid.
Before we get too indignant over the Saudi's beheading of a journalist we must remember that these people are merely several centuries behind us on their cultural and ethical journey. Our own noble sixteenth-century English forebears burned over 300 Protestants at the stake, an equally hideous form of execution, And they burned William Tynndale in 1535 for translating the Bible into English. Another translator, John Wycliffe escaped by dying a natural death before his scheduled bar - b - cue. But they exhumed his body and burned it anyway, just to be sure. Civilized, Christian behavior?
Please just build the wall and have our great  military men and women build it and place our National Guard there and at the Canadian border also.  Schumer and Pelosi are anti American and should be charged with treason against our great nation.  Open borders means our borders get bum rushed by anyone and everyone looking for a free pass.  Then sign their stupid bill...
Take the SNAP program from Migrants and seasonal farm workers.  Take away the free rides!    Start investigation on the Democratic‚Äôs. You know some of them are dirty!  Your doing a great job!!!!

I'm not a Democrat why do you always blame democrats. Fact is in still waiting on property clean up from Epa in Texas. And I defended you for 35 yrs of my damn life. Here's facts Trump you said Mexico would pay for the damn wall. Want more promises wrote out you made that I believe you never intended to keep. I could write them. I'm one went bankrupt. Most of the people are coming from Guatemala do I need to say that's not Mexico. I want cleaned up property so that I can make money. Not just buy a damn piece of property with some inheritance money to breed and sell horses, dogs, etc and food. You need to take responsibility for saying Mexico would pay. I always say stand tall , keep ur head up etc. When do I get my property cleaned up?  When does my daughter and grandkids get moved out? You need to answer those questions. Things take money don't they ? It's funny seeing all these damn people rich just like Clinton in here and yet look at bills son of mixed races. So, many make me out right sick. I should come first. And again FOX sucks. Homefree Fox and my own mortgage company in the past could give free houses away to in poisoned property. EPA has a duty to clean my property up. I don't want to shop to buy homemade goods from other people. Will you pay me 300,000 for my property the way it is right now. If so, I would like to sell. Otherwise I need it cleaned up to sell. It's a need more important than in my eyes ur damn wall right now. I'm sure you can order it done. Then you might get some wall or might not. I'm going to say again I supported you defending you 35 yrs of my life and I don't see you ever intended to get Mexico to pay. My nieces and nephew in Mexico motherless need help to get over here to United States. It takes lots of money or at some point to get out of an orphanage they will need to be scratch backs or wet backs,  wall climbers. What if Congress gives you 150 feet. My front yard is 300 ft. Better work on Mexico to pay right I know you want to keep your promises. Right
Someone left a bag of idiots open.
There should be a laugh track for every time trump lies during his Oval Office speech.
Build that wall Mr President!!! Screw what the CRAZY LIBTARDS want!! Who cares about the shut down? Libtards!! We all know that they dont matter. They are crazy, sick individuals. Obuma shut down the Government to force the shitty Obuma Care on the American people.  BUILD THAT WALL!!!
We don't need a border wall.  We don‚Äôt need to create artificial crises. We have enough real ones. Let us end this shutdown and bring the American people together around an agenda that will improve life for all of our people.
The wall is a waste of tax payer money. They can't keep drugs out of prisons yet you think a wall is going to stop the flow of drugs into the country or immigrants? Also you'd have to steal people's property to eminent domain.
BUILD THAT STEEL WALL & THROW ALL DEMOCRATS OVER IT! ü§£

Yes! The Americans want border security! Yes we want people to enter America legally.  Millions of illegals are not even paying taxes. They have no bank accounts.  No healthcare. Our country cannot continue to spend billions every year for the border problems ‚Äîwe need to be concerned about getting out of debt and not owing others.

Having Mexico pay for it was your promise you spin doctoring pathological liar
Build the wall or keep it shut down!  Start going after the 30 million illegals already here instead.  Door to door if you have to. Stop letting the numbers grow and do something about all of it. Enforce the law! If they wont do it our way , then lets spend billions enforcing the existing law and sweep the country for all illegals.
Build the wall then focus on draining the swamp starts with ousting islam from our government
There are no more Democrats they are imbeciles  Their only goal is to secure their own benefits.  And To go against you cause you‚Äôre name is  Donald J Trump Don‚Äôt mind them Boss!! We got your back All America has your back The real Constitutionalists have your back And we are right her and there with you We are everywhere And they ( our enemies) are scrambling and running like chickens without heads !! YOU KEEP BEING WHO YOU ARE
For Demorats it doesn‚Äôt matter if it is good for America.  Their hate for Trump is greater than their love for America!  Evil and Sad!!!
They end up at gitmo, #Demoncrats
I really don't understand how the whole world likes President Donald Trump and some Americans are busy playing politics saying trash about him.  The whole of Africa wishes someone like trump would govern them.  America is blessed and privileged to be governed by President Donald Trump. I would be Proud to call Him my President in front of the whole world.

what do you think when it comes to Donald Trump for one don‚Äôt trust him and why he constantly lies all of the time and you can‚Äôt believe him and also he‚Äôs Evil the snake üêç in the grass just waiting to bite you with his venom. ‚ÄòThis president lies daily‚Äô: Critics demand networks fact-check Trump‚Äôs live immigration speech. I think it‚Äôs time for a newer President and get rid of the trash meaning Donald Trump and he isn‚Äôt worthy to be the President or not worthy enough to be in the Whitehouse no longer. Trump said Friday that some previous presidents "have told me that we should have done it."  The four living ex-presidents do not back Trump up on that claim, you see that‚Äôs another lie on top of another lie
Not Apartheid Zionist Wall for colonization. Thanks. Take that Shite back across the pond from whence it came.
Very strange to many of us Constitutional Liberal Democrats. We have watched our Country get attacked over the last 30 years, escalating worse each time. Each time they warned us they would strike again. Each time they planned, practiced, and did it again. Does the Leftist condone this now??? If they think this threat is not real, why are you upset about bringing our Troops home. Fact: Leon Panetta' warned us our Electric Grids are in fact at risk and if hit could cripple our Nation, including our food supply. Does the Leftist doubt we WILL get hit again. Secure our Borders.  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1980380702266756&id=1452341315070700

I'm so glad Trump pulled this stupid ass stunt, he has no chance at all in 2020 now, his base is between 20 and 25 percent of legal voters laughable idiots, all of them and they will lose.
I still say that if we cut all aid to illegals,  no more birthright citizenship, or chain migration they will not want to come.
Remember President Trump , the Dems are the party of slavery , Jim Crowe , KKK , Neo Nazi , Black Lives Matter , Black Panthers , Antifia , Santuary states , And Cities , Now they want open borders, illegals to vote and drive without citizen ship , and our Benefits, plus no rule of law , what the hell going on here Wake up America shame on the Dems Trump Strong üí™

Finish the Trump Wall protect Americans anything else is just stupid .
The caravan was real. The chaos at the border is real. The 4000 murders the last two years by illegals is real. The 90% of the drugs flowing through the border is real. The fact that elected officials sworn duty is to protect the nation is real. Democrats are a disgrace.
Americans also wanted you to do something about our children being killed in our schools. Did you do anything about that?  No of course not. Big money donations from the NRA stopped that . Didn't it???? You pathetic hypocrite üëπüí©
Build the North Wall first. That‚Äôs where the real terrorists enter the country.

MAGA - Morons Are Governing America and Many Are Getting Arrested as well as many more are resigning the dumptanic while they still have some integrity, morals, values, principles, and respect for our country of which this regime has none. Border security is needed, but not a archaic vanity wall that is not needed and serves no purpose other than the moronic liar in the WH and his sycophant minions and Jim Jones cult45ers.
#BuildTheWall #NeverBackDown  The Democrats love illegals more than Americans.  Traitors!!!

Stopping a traitor and an incompetent fool is what they are doing.  You don‚Äôt get a border wall because you made a campaign promise. Your party works on a bill and gets it passed through Congress. Jackass. Why do I have to tell you that?

Boarder became stronger than it had ever been under Obama, anywhere that needs a fence has a fence lol. Poor fella, Trump looked so deflated and pissy during his pathetic oval office rant.  If our Russian hooker piss loving POTUS actually cared about illegal immigration he'd stop hiring them at his failing golf courses and address Visa overstays. But nope, not a peep about how illegal immigration actually occurs lol. Thank Allah that a patriot like Mueller continues to destroy the Trump daycare
I think I am going to answer your question, Mr. President. The Wall issue is not only political but also it is a DO or DIE situation for the Democrats, Sir. They know very well if they allow you to get the $5.7 billion to build the Wall, they will have no chance what so ever to win in 2020. They do not care about 800,000 Federal Employees not having their salaries; they do not care about whether a bunch of Terrorists and Criminals entering our Country; they do not care about the cost of feeding the illegal aliens who are already in our Country, they do not care about the criminal activities and killing innocent citizens, Sir the List is too long to mention. I am sure that We The People and the Federal Employees are aware of this situation; if anyone blames you he/she is totally out their minds! Mr. President, if you give up and go along with these Evil People in the Democratic Party, I do not think that you can win the Election in 2020, Sir! Therefore, you must hang in there, Sir.  If I may make another suggestion, Mr. President, if you could convince Turkish President Erdogan and The Israeli PM Nathanyahu for a sit-Down with you and convince them to reestablish their Friendship; Your problems in the Middle-East would be solved! Kurds can pull back to Northern Iraq to their autonomous republic and eventually have the Independent Republic their own, Turks will have to pull out Syria! They may have10 miles a bumper zone between Syria and their Country! Israel and Saudis in the South and the Turks in the North, with couple thousand American Troops stationed in Incirlik Air Base and Naval support Base in Iskenderun. I do not think anyone in the middle of this SET-UP will create any PROBLEMS! This is MY OPINION, some people may not agree with it!

It is not only trying to stop you  from fulfilling one of your promises........the democrats and rhino Republicans can not admit they FAILED the past 20 years from keeping out 115,000,000 illegals inside our border and they do not want to stop the flood of more that they have lured to our border.

MAGA!!!!!! They are going to say it openly, sooner or later, in the US.  The best policy for China is to liberate the North Korea. A free North Korean republic where the decimated 25 million 'half-animals' are born again as human beings  along the path of liberty, dignity and fair market! This will galvanize 1.4 bil. Chinese people. And also this will dismantle the moonJaeIn regime which is taking advatage of the false dilemma 'War vs. Peace'. Moonjaein, xijinping, and kimjongun are faithful servants and asslickers of satan

Part 2 of the article I started: Terrrorists Know the U.S. Border Is Not Secure  A Costa Rican immigration service official whose jurisdiction includes the Golfito camp disclosed that at least several other U.S.-bound suspected terrorists also were pulled from this camp since Qoordheen‚Äôs March 2017 arrest, likewise based on significant derogatory U.S. counterterrorism intelligence. The Costa Rican official declined to provide specifics of the intelligence beyond that it involved terrorism, offering only that: ‚ÄúMost are good, but some are bad.‚Äù  The American public was never told that Qoordheen and other suspected terrorists were pulled off U.S.-bound migrant routes in distant Costa Rica and Panama because such information is usually classified or not disclosable, in line with standard practice to protect ongoing investigations and operations.  That necessary opacity, unfortunately, seems to have given life to denialism about President Trump‚Äôs claims that terrorists are among migrants from countries of terror concern, like the Middle East. The skeptics have demanded proof then cited Trump perfidy when protected intelligence wasn‚Äôt provided. Trump‚Äôs assertions were thus ridiculed and dismissed as unsupported fear-mongering.  But the rejectionists, many of whom obviously do not know that a central homeland security practice is threat preemption, are wrong. Down here, on the southern-most leg of migrant routes to the American border, it is they who invite ridicule and eye rolls.  American, Panamanian, and Costa Rican law enforcement and intelligence officials are engaged in actual programs here to hunt, investigate, and deport real terrorist suspects who are, in fact, discovered among the thousands of migrants from the Middle East, Horn of Africa, and South Asia funneling through this section of Latin America‚Äîas President Trump said and as I saw and heard on the ground.  Migrants from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka processing through Costa Ricans customs at Paso Canoas on the Panama border. They are working at it here because sheer geography pushes tens of thousands of U.S.-bound migrants from all over the world who pass from South America landing zones through these two countries as they push north. Panama and Costa Rica are chokepoints on the migrant trail where ‚Äúextra-continental‚Äù travelers, as they are sometimes called at the American embassies, can become known in the greatest concentrations.  Terror Migrants Pulled From U.S. Border Routes Some acknowledgements of terror travel through these countries‚Äîand of the American efforts to mitigate it‚Äîare in public evidence, even if the underlying reporting remains confidential.  A December 19 Immigration and Customs Enforcement statement, for instance, announced the deportation of U.S.-convicted Brazil-based smuggler Sharafat Ali Khan after time served for transporting at least 100 aliens from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh through South and Central America to the United States. The statement offered this nugget, with the usual lack of elaboration: ‚ÄúSeveral of the individuals smuggled by Khan‚Äôs organization had suspected ties to terrorist organizations.‚Äù  The new statement seems to comport with earlier reporting by The Washington Times that one of these individuals was an Afghan involved in a plot to attack in the United States or Canada and had family ties to members of the Taliban.
Shut yo fat, old ,wrinkly, bald ass up .Casket waiting for you!
Build the wall i stand for trump
What will help is an immigration system like Canada and validation of immigration status. Visitor and employment visa‚Äôs are straightforward. Employers who hire illegals need big fines. They should use employment agencies to take immigrants who qualify.   Trump could also accept the recommendation to put more judges and immigration lawyers at the point of entry.  This would reduce the the misery of 60 per day and reduce the desperation of the thousands of poor huddled masses we used to welcome.
Stoping an ignorant moron like you sir, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important
schumer and pelosi are pieces of crap. I hope there is a hell.
Im with trump but you said Mexico would pay and now alot of people american people will be fucked come Friday and that's bullshit...don't we have enough people struggling paycheck to paycheck and now you made alot of people unable to pay bills come Friday.
Maureen Ryan Two years you people have been chasing the Russians. So, tell me, WHAT did the Russians do to influence your vote? Did you see something that we missed?  Tell us, what EXACTLY are you looking for? The FBI can't find it, the CIA can't either, Pelosi can't say what it is, neither can MSM. What are you looking for? Please tell.
Let's see how many lies can be told in 8 minutes! Everyone should FACT CHECK this idiot when he's done. Oh and Manadort conspiring with the Russians....imagine that as idiots campaign chair ...again imagine that!!!  Maybe idiot should build a wall around himself...oh wait the WALLS r closing in on him.
Interesting poll. Americans are certainly concerned about all manner of things. So...no explanation why "government" is at the top of the list and rising, while "immigration" is below that and falling? Oh, 16% of (mostly Republican) Americans think immigration is a problem, what a dramatic result! I've got an explanation. Fox News lied. Like you do, every time you open your mouth.  You know, it's almost like it's more important to us that we don't have a bunch of indolent, lying shitbags in Washington than that we build a worthless monument to xenophobia and paranoia. Go secure yourself.
Build the wall, but pay the Coast Guard!
Then get it built your the president, to hell with those clowns.
You can only fix something like illegal immigration if you take control of it. Building a wall is one step towards to just that. The tunnels underground and the planes that fly over the wall can be on the next security agenda.

We should have had more secure borders 30 yrs ago or more. The illegals  and drug runners and murderers would not be so rampant in our country.  Democrats DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!!!!! THEY  ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH STOPPING TRUMP NO MATTER WHAT. We may have to suffer a bit more, but we need him to stay strong for what this country needs for all of us to survive. This is AMERICA! Not Mexico, not Guatemala,  not Saudi Arabia.........etc. THIS IS OUR COUNTRY.  THE AMERICAN WAYS. TAKE YOUR WAYS BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY. NOT OURS!!!

The wall is already there, so it's obviously not doing much good considering you're still bitching and moaning about illegal immigration. How about you come up with a better idea to combat illegal immigration?!? You complain about the security concerns for the country not taking into consideration that tsa agents are doing a very shitty job at American airports because they're not getting paid. YOU are making us vulnerable to terrorists!!
Your promises are worthless, just like you Trump.
Build a wall, after the wall is build then what? All illegal aren‚Äôt able to get in any more, You think your still safe? Not! God made haven and earth he never put walls in haven and he never put wall on earth! You were born with out a wall, right? You came through your mother‚Äôs camel. She didn‚Äôt put a wall for you to be born out right? Think about that. If you put a wall to everything you don‚Äôt want in then you have a big problem. I‚Äôm not saying illegal to come in to the USA. Without papers. Is there a wall in hell? Nope! You choose haven or hell?
Build the wall! It‚Äôs the morally correct thing to do because it will save lives.
We live on the border. Its scary at best! The country has no idea of the drugs and criminals and drug runners pouring over the border. BUILD THE WALL. We support the shut down.
Build the wall, toss those who oppose it over it and let‚Äôs see how well it works!
They want power and greed..at our expense. I'm so sick of congress.
Americans want better pay and less cost of living . Good health insurance and less medication idiot
President Trump. Have a group of people make a list of all the crimes committed to American‚Äôs from illegals. Plus all the illegals that are working and getting paid money who are not paying taxes. I would bet that number to be in the billions. These facts will show congress that we need a wall.
69% don't think your temper tantrum Wall is necessary at this moment. 59% OPPOSE  it altogether. Grow up you inept, paid grades educated, coward. Bone spurs kept your chickenass out of military service but they don't seem to hurt your fatass playing golf.
Build the wall! How many of you have fences around your yard and would prefer someone to knock on your front door before walking around your backyard, fences protect you and your family the border is the same thing we're not against immigrants just illegal immigration!
Americans do not want to pay for border security.  Just your uneducated trumptards.
I wish congress would get off our president Trumps back and let our President do his job and keep his campaign promise and make our country safe or has congress and the American people 4-got 911. We the Americans  pay our taxes, pay our own bills p ay for our own homes work for supporting our family.  What does the Illegal immigrants pay for ?
Democrats want more Illegals so they get more votes
Build the damn wall before we end up with another 600,000 in this country.  30 million illegals is ENOUGH.

Them Democrats need a pay cut all useless!! Build the wall ! You are the president
I want immigrants to come here legally we have drugs and crime overflowing from the border build the wall
Wow what a fucking coward .... rump is in the sewer where he is most comfortable spewing crap üí©
Its not fair that we pay taxes for illegals and the fact that they have bought up 75% of dallas where is all this money coming from whentheyco.e from nothing why do we have to pay for them ??? Also how do illegals file taxes with no legal documents?? I have a diverse family and i am for every one but this is not right nor fair to us BUILD THE WALL!!
Build the wall, borrow the money from Mexico, then don't pay it back.
Schumer and Pelosi 2  slimey snakes that look guilty...
Forget the Wall.. Just take away the reward.  Enforced laws make it illegal to hire Illegals.. Laws with teeth and severe penalties.  Simple.
No. They don‚Äôt.   "Because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it," Trump continued, seemingly oblivious to the fact that he was taking ownership of a potentially costly and unpopular breakdown in federal government operations.
We sure do! 100% behind you Mr. PRESIDENT do not let Dems kill America! Fight Fight Fight you are RIGHT!!!
I say that Trump you should demand the justice department to file criminal charges against local leaders, and state government leaders who knowingly violate: U.S. Code ‚Ä∫ Title 8 ‚Ä∫ Chapter 12 ‚Ä∫ Subchapter II ‚Ä∫ Part VIII ‚Ä∫ ¬ß 1324                                                                                             (iii)   knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of transportation;                                       Sanctuary cities????
Hey do you stupid trump supporters ever feel it in the ass?
Donald your doing great. Build that wall and tell the Democrats to go to hell. They are worthless deal killers. We love God Country and proud your our president
Yes Build the Wall, our security is at risk, I‚Äôm convinced that Dems care more about illegals than the citizens they are sworn to protect üò° Ask yourself why they want all this chaos at the border??? Who‚Äôs getting kickbacks from all the drugs that come across #followthemoney
Illegals are bringing disease like HIV and TB and sticking us with the bill
Donald, with all your billions, why don‚Äôt you build a 50 foot steel wall around yourself and stay there. We need to protect ourselves from you. You are crazy, corrupt and dangerous !!!
Chuck and Nancy want to build a wall with the bodies of American Citizens. They have a good start. Their illegal aliens slaughter Americans daily. Among other hideousness crimes.
Anyone that can‚Äôt see this is political is a pure idiot !!!
My Prez, do what i elected you to do! Hell with stupid idiots with fences around their yards!
No we don't want another wall Trump, we need better trade and jobs...we need cheap illegal immigrants to do our dirty work
Yes, border security is a must and special for a republic. If not the hyenas, zebras, and the wild dogs will enter the republic and take cover under democracy as every hooliganism is done under democracy.
Dear president  Trump,I am  so  sorry  for  the  way  you  are  being  treated .  I thank  God  for  putting  you  in  the  White  house  I hope  you  succeed  in all you  plan if it's   in  God's  will. God's  will and his plan must come first. If you  let the Lord  lead you  then the devil has no power . WE will  be  praying  for  you .
You promised mexico would pay for it.Lies are all you bring to the table.Worst president in the history of our country.
We  do  not  need  a  fucking  wall!    We  need  a  better  president!
Lora Hill Well one reason is all the mainstream media will show is some women and kids trying to come in. Not the thousands of drug runners who terrorize anyone who gets in your way. Or the one officer who covers 1000 square miles. Are the families whose lives are threatened by the cartels.
James McCaskill I know and it makes me so mad that everyone has an opinion but never experience the effects
Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets. But if you listen to mainstream media or the Democrats nothing wrong with our borders.
Oh my god some one needs to give me a call because I live down south and illegals kill our animals and breaking in to houses while children are sleeping to steal; there are barrels set out with high flags with Augua to stop them from damaging our property
Stopping you is always #1 for the Democrats. You could say you were giving all of your wealth to everyone below the poverty line and they would do everything to stop you.
Here's a thought on how to help fund the wall/fence/barrier and indirectly make Mexico pay for it. Levy a $20 tax on every money order being sent from individuals in the US to individuals in Mexico. Millions leave our country every day in the form of money orders sent from here to there. Many illegal immigrants work here, live on very little so they can send thousands back home with the plan of retiring there. That is money that benefits Mexico's economy instead of ours.
NO-ONE in their right mind, would want Open borders. 8-)   The ONLY ones who want open borders, are Illegals, criminals, and the ones who would profit from foreigners entering America Illegally. :(

Democratic Party are all a bunch of hypocrites! Please build the wall and drain the swamp! You are doing a wonderful job as our president! Thank you and God Bless you and our nationüá∫üá∏üôè
Ask pelosi why do you have a wall around your house. I‚Äôm so sick of these brain dead Dems. You are the ones I‚Äôd like to impeach. DO YOUR DAM JOBS!
Stand your ground Mr. President.  Build that wall! It's time that America does for the American people.. stop all foreign aid, induce term limits theres too many corrupt people in congress. We need to do away with big pharma ( the ones lining the Democrats crooked little pockets and turning them against their own country), Nancy and Chuck also need to be held accountable for putting America at risk by causing delays to national security.
Yes. Keep us safe from them and all the disease they bring with them. I cant afford to get sick thanks to Obummer care. <><
They suck President Trump! Thank God ur President. America still has a chance
Democrats are not afraid the wall won't work. They are afraid the wall will work! #TRUMP2020 #MAGA
Please HELP to STOP CORRUPTION in Romania! Thieves and convicted people in the Government! NO ETHICS! Political system over Justice.  Communism undercover! Thank you and GOD bless us!
Build the walls and then put bombs along it.
The companies that used to be in America and move to Mexico make them pay for the fucking wall like Chrysler GM Hersey must I go on . I hope President Trump gets this message those companies went to Mexico for cheaper labor and then fucked the American people out of jobs. Never again will I buy a American product that was Built in Mexico.
Why don't the president STOP the free ride for the illegal immigrants that are in America illegally?? Stop the free ride!!!
As long as it KEEPS ILLEGALS OUT OF THIS COUNTRY works for me! BUILD it right in the first place so we won't have to keep doing it! You'd THINK, with AS MANY Congressmen/women that are MILLIONAIRES, that they would HELP to make our country safer, but they're so tight fisted and require so much more of us citizens. They want this country to fail so they can make it a socialist country!
Mr.President  You have to shut down obamas state of emergencies. And take down these crooks. The time is now. Before the next bunch of crazys steal their way into our government.  Look its time to fight these crooks. File state of emergency and tell America what these crooks have been doing. And their plan to bring America down. Please I see the time. And Americans at least some have no ideal. But you know the truth and if you wait . These people will keep it up until America is gone. The power is yours to save America from foreign powers and these sick sick evil people. GOD is real and to save America is to break the back of this state and government crooks. You can tell yourself these people will back off. They will not. And if they tell you this they are evil liars . You know the truth. Now save this NATION before its destroyed and can't be fixed. You are the Man. And our prayer and hopes are in you . Because GOD allowed you this time.  Remember this maybe the only chance we as true Americans get. Thank you. And may GOD guide you with power to destroy evil. I Believe. So do what's right.
Our country is in massive debt. Letting in more and more illegals will continue to make OUR debt, healthcare cost, job loss, and lots of other problems increase. Who's going to pay for it? Increase taxes? There's going to be a point where the government asks to much of its citizens and it will cripple all Americans into relying on a government that can't afford it. The problem is wasteful spending by our government. I know a lot of people think the wall is wasteful spending but I ask you, compare it to the next 10 years of taking care of new citizens who can't take care of themselves? Majority of the people crossing the border illegally are not skilled and are looking for our government to take care of them. If it continues it will be our largest economic downfall in history... And we are doing it to ourselves. One party wants this, why? Simple, future votes... Anyone coming across the boarder currently has the chance of becoming a citizen and will vote for the party helping them... That will silent your vote as current citizen.... Something to think about.
Shut down the boarder period. The lost trade would be Mexico's share of the build and for those US businesses that lose revenue on the can claim from the pot of money not being paid to illegals and noncitizens.
Shut up already you blowhard. So sick of your lying face I could puke. Worst president of my lifetime, hands down.
Most of amerika want you to go back to Russia
Send ALL the illegals to Ca. and let them deal with the problem. See how long that last.
Build the wall get on with fire all the demo rats we don't need them anyway
Build that wall Trumpy. Promises made promises kept!
Build that wall!!! Suck it up and get over it ,you crybaby Dems! You don‚Äôt care about the people ( the US citizens or the immigrants) you just hate Trump because he stands for the people not his own agenda. üò°
Democrats just want cheap labor and votes .phony bastards
Build it on Mexico side
You tell it like it is Mr President, democrats saying you are just mad for not getting your way and the facts you spoke was not real, tell them at next meeting lets go back to 9/11, illegal immigrants took America and caused it to stand still that day, remind them how many innocent Americans lost their lives that day. Is that what they want to happen again. Or the Boston Marathon where illegal immigrants caused many injuries and death. I could go on and keep stating facts. Democrats need to wake up to reality, we do have a crisis.

Lock them up for treason!  They are not for securing our border but willing to spend tons of money for illegals??
Yeah, border security, not a pointless fucking wall
The Democrats are only refusing because of who is asking. That is it. They did not act like that when Obama was President. He should have been thrown in Prison along with Hillary...but they did nothing. But yet, they keep going after President Donald J. Trump. It doesn't matter what it is, they will keep working against our President and every member in the Federal government that is doing that needs to be kicked out of Office. We want our elected Officials to what we elected them to do, and that is to secure our borders and keep our country safe. We write their pay checks...it's time they do their job..or get out!
Oh dear , but didn‚Äôt they(terrorists )fly in an attack New York ..... you should not be letting government employees shoulder the burden of the shut down , its not their crisis and when senators are about to receive a pay increase...... the world is watching an sniggering at this circus !!!
2020 no more bullshit go Trump . Don‚Äôt stop now
The DEA doesn't want the wall because it won't help. Drugs come in primarily through normal points of entry, or by boat, plane. Illegal immigrants, on the scale that affect american jobs, come in via overstays. It's pure bullshit. We don't need this wall. Illegal immigration across the southern border has been trending down and is now net NEGATIVE. The idea that the wall will improve the US Job market is nonsense. What is at stake here is bigger than $5bn in the federal budget. It is about making decisions RATIONLLY and on the basis of facts and analysis of them. https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/29/trump-says-border-wall-will-stop-drugs-heres-what-a-dea-intel-report-says/
Build the wall or bring back the scalp trade
They hate anything about you, it‚Äôs crazy. Just keep it. I‚Äôm  sorry for the people that aren‚Äôt getting paid but this is the only way that we‚Äôre ever going to have a secure country, if we don‚Äôt do this now there‚Äôs going to be Mayhem!! Alll  is you‚Äôre trying to do is secure this country why would anybody be against this, it makes no idea unless there something political behind it then it makes perfect sense!!!! Drain that SWAMP!!!!!!!
I agree we need border security and the walls will do the perfect trick to keep illegals out, if they want to come to our country they can do so LEGALLY (: and btw Donald J. Trump your doing a amazing job

I‚Äôm neither party but if you think a wall is going to stop drugs from coming in here and the murder rate is going drop you are crazy and believe me I‚Äôm all about protecting our country been there done that. If you want to convince me about boarder protecting put in mine fields, gun towers with air support from Apache helicopters. It will be 100 times effective a lot cheaper and guess what... it will produce jobs especially for our veterans! Once you see love ones getting their heads blown off better yet blown to pieces I bet you stop trying to cross! VIOLENCE is the ANSWER üíØüá∫üá∏üíØa wall what a joke! Where you thing the drugs and real terrorist are coming from! It‚Äôs sure not south of the boarder! They fly in from ALL over the world and let their VISA run out! Americans are stupid and I can‚Äôt believe you let some rich politician scare y‚Äôall like a bunch of babies! I don‚Äôt live in fear üíØ
Build the wall! Deport those evil invaders!
Build the wall! Deport those evil invaders!
When the wall is finally built throw Pelosi and Schumer over it.
Build the fucking wall and cage yourself.
33% of people (aka your base) are the only ones that want it. You‚Äôre a complete dumbass.  I voted for you because I‚Äôm independent and you said you would drain the swamp and you weren‚Äôt a politician. You are a traitor to the US and tax cheat that uses the oval to line your pockets while you spread lies to your base because they are too uneducated to call you out on your BS. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Impeach the dumbass orange man
Keep it shut down, Mr President. We know you are fighting alone up there. But WE THE PEOPLE have your back. To Hell with those gutless republicans who refused to use the "nuclear option". Damn all of them.
Bwhahaha üòÇ you promised Mexico would pay for it you dumb-f! üòÇ remember? ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs gonna pay for it?!?!‚Äù At your klan gathering. üòÇ
In fact, illegal immigration costs taxpayers a staggering $134.9 billion a year while contributing only $19 billion in state, federal, and local taxes. At the federal level, medical costs make up the lion‚Äôs share of government expenditures on illegal immigrants, while education is the largest single expense that illegal immigration imposes on state and local governments.  Sadly, an overloaded welfare state is not the only negative side-effect of our broken immigration system. Communities across America are also being devastated by the violent crime and drug trafficking that result from our failure to control the border ‚Äî an issue Donald Trump has addressed repeatedly and emphatically ever since he first announced his candidacy for president.
Even if you somehow get your stupid wall you still wouldn't be keeping your so called promise. Remember, YOU PROMISED MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR IT. Now you want American tax payers to pay for it.
Every poll taken shows that the majority of Americans don't want your expensive, unnecessary, stupid vanity wall which you want only so that you can brag to your uneducated base that you kept your promise. Even if you got the wall,  you.lied over and over again that Mexico would.pay for it. Trumped up fake crisis by a lying,  cheating, unqualified jerk of a president desperate to save his.own corrupt hide! Reopen the government and stop lying (if that is even possible!)
What an ass Mexico was supposed to pay that was the promise
Would be an interesting experiment to put a wall around CA and see what kind of secure life they would end up with bearing in mind their mindset on allowing the illegals to stay in the US.  They want them, now live with them all confined to CA, but then again, you would have to keep them all within that wall.  I wonder just how long it would take before the people told the governor "Your Fired".
the border is secure. you are unfit for office. RESIGN.
Go Trump. People seem to forget that the Clintons and the Obama government did nothing to sort out the border problems, so thousands of illegal immigrants under their rein poured into America and have robbed America of jobs, taxes and people's lives! Trump is trying to solve a problem caused by years of bad government but now you DemonRATS blame him! Guess you forgot The DemocRATS closed down the government too when they were in power. Apply legally to come into America and not illegally! Keep up the good work and don't let these snowflakes into power ever again. MAGA
What a twat you are. The only reason you want to build that wall is to have your name on it The Trump wall. Like the The Trump tower. You selfish twat. Nothing is normal coming out from your little ugly piggy mouth ü§Æ
You must not have seen the videos of the fat woman with children walking across the very high 4' off the ground piece of wire and walking right in. Clueless
Dennis Coughlan I don't get it, if I want to keep you out of my yard and I build a big ass wall with Barb wire on top with cameras , with sensors on the ground, your saying it won't stop you? It will stop   95% of it for sure
Susan Davison, I know right. The truth isnt something these trumpanzees want to hear.
Dennis Coughlan sssssshhhhhh
How are democrats stopping you from building a wall you said Mexico would pay for? Is it because you lied and are now trying to stick American tax payers with the $25 billion dollar wall. Your stupid wall idea only covers a small percentage of the country and does absolutely nothing to stop the 40% of immigrants that fly in. Your $25 billion dollar wall will do nothing to stop illegal immigration. Why dont you just be honest and admit you know how to embezel and extort a ton of money from this wall project.
BUILD THE WALL!  American security and safety over political garbage!
We need to stop allowing illegal aliens to come here and have babies to get them social security numbers! If you don‚Äôt have SS# neither should your child.
BUILT THE WALL!! PROTECT OUR COUNTRY FROM ILLEGALS
BUILT THE WALL!! PROTECT OUR COUNTRY FROM ILLEGALS
We need to secure the border, get rid of sanctuary cities, and really fix our country.
It'll be great when the wall is finished them we can really fix our problems and not have to worry about illegals coming over
secure our borders, build the wall .. those idiots are filled with hatred and divide, they want the border, they need the border, just want to fight ..shame on them for being so mindless

Terrorists aren‚Äôt coming through Mexico.  We do have people coming down from Canada, 95% by air or tunnels.   The wall at the Southern border makes little sense except to make it difficult for vehicles.  I live in NYC.  People climb 80 story buildings here so a 10 or 20 ft concrete wall would stop nothing.  Also right now more Americans are moving to Mexico than coming here.  You can live well in many areas for very little money.

why do you think we need a wall,, they don't just come through the airports ya know..  tell it congress..
Right now we need security at our airports where we are actually stopping thousands on our terror list. Agents aren‚Äôt being paid.  You sir are a fraud.   Do us a favor and crawl back into your reality tv hole    You make a piss poor human.
You are a disgrace to the American people
We need to be protected from your worthless ass, you fucktard.
Both sides have played the border wall card. Its just different now because... ya know... the POTUS is a dickhead.
They're a bunch of pathetic weirdos scumbags
Please don't forget to pray that God be merciful to us, for allowing our country to get this way.  For anyone who has the mind to do it, let's get on our knees and ask God's forgiveness for turning our backs on him.  We're the ones who have elected silly and evil people to our lawmaking offices.  Now we have to pray for rescue from them, that is, from the evil one who motivates them.  God bless.
The wicked witch of the west and her puppet chuckles don‚Äôt give a damn about Americans. If it has trumps name on it they‚Äôre against it. Throw your DAMNocratic temper tantrum in another country. And NOBODY on Congress should be getting a paycheck till the DAMNocrats man up

Your promise has been broken you fucktard. You said Mexicans were going to pay for that wall. Now the very people that voted for you are now not getting a paycheck, quit working, and now not protecting our country. So full of yourself but a great salesman you are.
Your a FUCKING JOKE, CANT WAIT FOR BREAKING NEWS TO BE TRUMP HAS BEEN KILLED
Build the wall, deport all illegals, no benefits of any kind for illegals/"refugees" Tel them the American Frere Ride is over.
If you build the wall my generation will tare it down. The wall is almost as dumb as Trump saying there has been a border issue in the US for thousands of years... How can anyone support this lying, ignorant wanna be dictator.
The majority don't want a wall. There is no security crisis at our southern border. You're shutdown is hurting families and the economy. You're keeping children in cages and allowing them to be physically and sexually abused. NO WALL! This is not Germany.
I believe in legal immigration but not illegal immigration.  If this continue this country will become a cesspool.  We have enough crime from our own citizens. We don‚Äôt need criminals from other countries
Stop being a pussy and make those faggets build the wall
Screw the leftist losers!!!
Let us so-called redneck's run the border.  Just say the. Word.    We got you Donald
Let us so-called redneck's run the border.  Just say the. Word.    We got you Donald
Wow, the garbage that is going on right now is absurd.  We've heard many Presidents say that border security is imperative yet it is still a problem today.  Why, because it's never been addressed like Donald J. Trump is addressing it.  Change is HARD, we cannot continue to allow floods of people to come here, for 1 many are ill and our healthcare systems are already taxed, 2 many/most don't speak English and if their children go to school the teachers have to accommodate/bring in additional bi-lingual teachers (another expense on our tax dollars)...I need to shut up.  Open borders aren't fair to those that want/need to come here legally and to allow them will only bring the U.S. down to a marginal/minimal way of life.  Not fair to anyone.
Hopefully they'll come to their sences
Please don‚Äôt activate the fucking obama care
Democrats are like little children. Using any excuse to not admit when Trump or the Republicans are right. Even though they wanted these items before Trump came along. They would rather sacrifice more American souls.

Instead of spending all this money on the wall why don't we use some to fix it up a little bit, but  also use some to strengthen our immigration laws, and also fix our welfare system. Instead of helping the lazy jerks that sit at all all day why not give them a reason to work instead of just giving them food stamps, section 8 and public housing. Why don't we reserve those things for the actual working middle class people who other wise can not afford to live and support their families even though they are working 40+ hours a week!
Build the wall and then deport all criminals.
Republicans are such sheep.  Are you all too dumb to actually see what this guy is doing.   Distraction Distraction Distraction.  Wake up people.   There is no crisis at the southern border.  The crisis is taking place in the Pumpkin man‚Äôs head.
you gotta make a consequence fit the argument : Shut down just the entitlement programs that illegals come here for at the hands of un-willing tax payers, then re-open the rest...you‚Äôll never lose this way.
If a politician is not for a sucure border they must be profiting from this somehow somewhere SOMEONE. Lets see human trafficking, drugs, or more than we know . So this makes me think if your not for a secure border you must be involved in illegals . yes?

Build the wall, it is sad they try calling illegal immigrants, migrants, no they are illegal immigrants
smart border security, not a dumb ass wall.
They dgaf about the American people, stop anything with trumps name on it at all cost, at any measure.  Lie, scream, distort, propagandize.  They dgaf... do what needs to be done at any cost.  Dont give them an opportunity or heads up on anything, that gives them time to twist and lie thier asses off.  We support you mr president, we voted for you to do, not play politics with these moronic crackheads...
Only terrorists and stupid people are against the wall.  TRUMP 2020!
Thank god he‚Äôs off the air. What a fucking liar. Remove him by any means possible to preserve the constitution.
Build the wall & lock them all up!!!
Anyone else think that perhaps the real reason the left doesn‚Äôt want this is possibly the old divide and conquer thing, possibly created by NWO to make this country fail?  The wall makes total sense, at least financially. But the left doesn‚Äôt want to pay for it. But they‚Äôll pay subsidies for a sanctuary city. Two words. Illegal ( meaning not legal) alien ( meaning not of this nation) . By that definition, which is a very basic one, how can the left condone the immigration problem?  The wall needs to be in place!
They are not after you. It's a dumb idea you narcissistic idiot.  What's more important is putting that money back into the nation not in a flaming barrier that provides nothing back.
We do.  The Democrats need to get their heads out of their tails and fund the wall.
We want border security and we are tired of taking hardworking taxpayers money being used to take care of these people what the people nor and raised in this country I mean it's crazy how many people I know that both parents work overtime and they still have no health insurance I just don't get it sometimes I think democrats have dumbed this country down so much that maybe another country will just nuke us democrats won't shut up till there's nothing left
Resign and save the country a ton of money and lots of agony.
Resign and save the country a ton of money and lots of agony.
The vermin would sell out their country to get more votes.
How about Congress take their pay, ALL OF IT, away to pay those who are not getting paid if they are so 'concerned' for the American people?! How about that?  MAYBE then they will get off their high horse ass n heads out of their asses get this shut down over with!!!
Shut down is fine! We hope for a New Party! No more corrupt Democrat Party! Please install not only Border Walls but An American People Freedom Party! What‚Äôs in America is for America until people out there learn to come into our country legally!
Build the wall.  If walls don't work then the next DNC and RNC will not put a wall around the arena area they are at.  Lets all hold our breath.  They will be putting up walls...just wait.   What a bunch of elected idiots.
Build the wall. Somebody that knows how, start a GoFundMe.
Democrats are just obstructionists that need to be hung for treason...
Build wall. Shut down border. Deport ever single SOB that‚Äôs here illegal. Be making trillions because not feeding scum. MAGAFOREVER!!!!!!!
Then hire more border control security and use the funds to pay them not build a pointless wall, you twat.
Stop belittling Blacks and Latinos like a lot of us aren‚Äôt professionals or educated and only do menial jobs. Not true! Remember, we had a President, Obama. We‚Äôre not in the slavery days! Remember those days when y‚Äôall beat, hung and raped us at a whim, for nothing as usual, just cruel. Stop crying and acting like y‚Äôall are so innocent and helpless with your mass murders and serial killers and rapists.
Walls keep prisoners in jail wall can keep asshole out
Build a wall and legalize recreational pot. That‚Äôs how you win in 2020. MAGA
Whatever rump, you started this asshole. It's all on you. You said you would take the blame, but of course you folded, you ass!
Bomb Mexico NOW before they attack !!!
BUILD THE WALL!!! Sir you have a phone and a pen just like Obama did!
I'm in Mexico right now. Every h ilme here has a wall around it, a fence around it and razor wire all along the rop. So if the Mexican families need this ro be safe, then why should we ler MS13 run freely into the U.S.? The democrats say only 6 terrorists caught at the norder. Guess what it only takes ONE TERRORIST to cause a mass casualty!!!
Trash speech from a trash president
Susann Lund democrats are not stupid,just immoral.......
Gary Fiktus stupid
Murdering babies globally>protecting the U.S.A.
We will not build Donald Trump's fucking white supremacist wall.
The biggest threat to security is him. By shutting down the government he has caused the TSA to become weaker which means threats can come via  airports. Food stamps which people depend on are not getting them which will result in a increase of crime because people get desperate. federal workers are not being payed not knowing what or if they will get paid. If you support trump you have no compassion or foresight to see who your ignorance is effecting. You do realize your country is in trillions of dollars of debt and he wants to spend what you don't have. His grandmother was an illegal immigrant the same thing you say was said to his own family members.

Your promise was to have Mexico pay for your stupid wall not us Americans Fucktard! Don't sweep that HUGE detail under the rug about your so called promise
Will you PLEASE STOP JERKING Around and just CLOSE The F&&ing BORDER!!!!!!
Canals need water, right?
Jason Jones  a canal in a drought desert area????
Turn that border into a canal! Dig it deep enough that the sides become a natural wall. Then the US and Mexico get trade growth from the canal being used, and we get a deterrent to illegal border crossings!
Why do illegals think it is the American taxpayers responsibility to make their dreams come true.  We should take the hundred and50 billion $ a year we spend on illegals and put it into our infrastructure our teachers and everything else that is already here
Build that wall and take the pay of Congress as well as the little guys
Yeah he promised Mexico would pay for the wall the lieing SOB.
they are so full of hate for you that they see nothing good in what you are trying to achieve for the Americans.   I for one do not favor illegal aliens taking over our country.   If they want to join in the legal fashion then fine but otherwise get your scrawny ass out of here!!!!
Build the wall, steel barrier!
BUILD THE WALL, FENCE, AND WHATEVER ELSE WE NEED!
BUILD THE WALL, FENCE, AND WHATEVER ELSE WE NEED!
I still believe we need to build a tall wall. How about we also build a deportation system next to the wall. Human slingshot or catapult comes to mind. One every mile, so the border patrol and ICE can immediately deport them back. Brutal and should be very effective. Extra points for Cactus landing fields. For every 10 illegals deported, lets launch a democrat politician over the wall too. Kind of like greasing the rails or something.

They‚Äôre stopping you from showing your tax returns!? SOB‚Äôs P.S. ‚ÄúOr else I‚Äôll shut it down‚Äù is not ‚Äúworking together‚Äù.
F*cking appalling!!! Words do not express the hope I have that these assholes feel the worst pain imaginable as they burn in hell for eternity.   Thank you Mr. President Trump and all who support the defense and security of this country.
The dumbocrats are the ones to blame for government workers not getting paid. Pull your heads out of your ass and give this man our president the money he needs to protect our country by building that wall. What's its gonna take?!?!? Your mother, sister, daughter, son, father...the list goes on of people that we love that we can lose or be harmed by these people you're protecting and accepting into our country. Not to mention the expense that we have to undergo when they come in.
Get back to work. You're not accomplishing anything except hurting your own people.  ...idiot
Build  the  wall.    Control  who  enters  our  country.
Build the wall- secure our borders
Build the wall- secure our borders
Buy commercials giving arrest stats, educate voters on dangers. Dems don‚Äôt care, only want illegals to vote
The Democrats are being ASSHOLES. The American people want the wall, but they won't give an inch. Just to make Trump look bad. I hope there's a landslide victory for Trump in 2020.
Build the wall and at the same time focus on true reform.  It shouldn't take a person years and thousands of dollars to legally immigrate.    Make it easier to immigrate while at the same time eliminate ANY access to welfare benefits which should be for citizens only.  Build the Wall,  Thank you for finally being the President who will do what is right to protect the border and put principle, values above the needs of a political party.
They want to stop you, but please keep doing what the American people voted you into office to do!!! Many people pray for you daily and for the protection you need from the maniacs on the 'other side'.....
Trump rocks! Nancy and Schumer are idiots.
You are a national disgrace and a global embarrassment.  You are also a fraud and a pathological liar.  Do go to jail soon. üëãüá∫üá∏ #MAGA
Call a national emergency and bypass the idiots.
Nancy Pelosi has a wall around her house, yet she doesn‚Äôt want a wall to protect the American people. Chuck Schumer locks the doors to his home and office, but doesn‚Äôt want a wall and Ports of Entry to protect the American people. The Democrats not only want to give billions to other countries, but they want to give $12 Billion MORE this year, which they seemed to find the funds for, yet they refuse to allocate less than half that amount to protect the American people. The Democrats voted for a wall and tougher border security for President Obama, but refuse to support border security under President Trump. Schumer is mad because he claims President Trump hasn‚Äôt given him any words on how the money is spent, but was perfectly fine with passing Obamacare without reading the Bill. Democrats hate President Trump, and they hate everyone who voted for him. And they are willing to make all of us pay for that.
Lost another irrational fb yesterday over this issue.  She called the President the ‚Äúliar in chief‚Äù and accused me of having a ‚Äúhateful heart‚Äù when I said that an illegal Dominican drug lord who lives in my hometown in RI, and has been arrested multiple times, should be deported.  üôÑ  Unfriended her! Why are people lacking common sense?  The wall isn‚Äôt going to solve all the problems if states (like RI and MA) refuse to send illegals that are arrested to ICE for deportation.
Yeah but a working government will suffice
Shut it down.  Government spending is out of control.  I‚Äôd rather spend money on a wall then to support illegal immigrants pouring into our country
They already made illegal x on they birth certificates now all they gotta do is cross the border it's a set up Build that wall by any means..
Build the the wall Trump keep us safe,piss on That Bitch Pelosi!!!
You just need to start blasting out little videos where all these dems have said they are for border security.  Call them out on their hypocrisy.  I bet they fold instantly.
The RATS couldn't care LESS about us LEGAL citizens - their goals are:   1) Getting more ILLEGALS into the country so they can get more votes  2) Stopping ANYTHING you want to do

Democrats don‚Äôt care how many people are killed by illegals. They don‚Äôt want him to fix this country...
Democrats have pure evil hate for Trump and America. Their choice is greed and power. Americans are becoming more aware. Less freebies to illegals will build the wall period.
We need this wall built...enough of illegal immigrants entering this country for how many years now?
Is it time for dumbass to start lying and blaming yet?
2022243121 This is the # to contact your representative ... demand funding for border security now!!! SHARE SHARE SHARE
Americans do want border security! What we don‚Äôt want is those 2 morons in charge holding up the funds. There acting like  pissed off jealous children.  Enough !!!
Don't give up Mr. President! Perhaps you should send Chuck and Nancy to one of the more active areas along the border for a while and then see if they feel the same way. We need this wall.
Open Borders an easy way to attack America with bio-agents . CDC have identified anthrax as one of a few biological agents capable of causing death and disease in sufficient numbers to cripple a developed region or urban setting.
Stopping you.. Democrats are evil ! Stay strong in this trump !
A clean bipartisan bill was before you, ask Lil‚Äô bitch McConnell where it is.
Trump please don‚Äôt do this. We know you rich as hell but WE NOT. Everybody don‚Äôt have millions billions and trillions you shutting the govt down messing w ppl money is ridiculous those Mexicans going to find a way to do wadever they gonna do regardless of a WALL! A wall trump ?! A damn wall bro ? 5billion dollar wall ughhhhhhhhhh you really pissing the Americans off
The promise was that Mexico was going to pay for it.   But now it‚Äôs not?   You‚Äôre a liar.
The promise was that Mexico was going to pay for it.   But now it‚Äôs not?   You‚Äôre a liar.
Democratic did not say we was going to pull up the wall you said come on trunk stop playing without money I got a building to manage be honest I rather deal with the Bush family you're the worst president I ever had in my life
So at this points the loves + likes = 14,086  laughs are 274.  Hmmmm
Stopping you, because Democrats are idiots
Make it where only US citizens can vote and the Democrats won‚Äôt give a rats tail about immigration.
Karen Ann Bradshaw aren't taxes withheld from gross pay?
I want the border secure.  I live in Texas and I can‚Äôt tell you several times  I hired someone with a Social Security number that turned  out to be fake when I filed it with Social Security. I never knowingly hired anyone who was illegal. That means that I paid someone $20 an hour for 40 hours a week and they did not pay any income taxes because they lied.   If you‚Äôre an illegal alien you cannot pay income tax because you do not have a Social Security number. Think about that Americans.
Just put the military on the job put small bases every 40 miles
Democrats don‚Äôt care if anyone one dies. They love violence and crave corruption.  They steel all our money and give it to illegals and keep the rest for themselves.
Do what you have to do. Build the wall! They are arrogant assholes who waste billions of dollars on ridiculous crap every year! They don't care about anything but their own agenda not the people of this country. Build the wall üá∫üá∏ Thank you for caring about us üíú
To the democrats every illegal is a family looking for a better life, to the republicans it's a gang banger whose been deported 3 times before, or an ISIS terrorist in disguise. Truth is its both, good people and bad people. But we cannot help the good people until stop the bad people with a wall and make everyone go through at least as much security as at an airport.
Build that wall. It doesn't matter where the money comes from. We do not need or respect the democratic party. They have proved to be worthless.
IMPEACH TRUMP!!! TRUMP FOR PRISON!!! REPORT FAKE NAMES AND PROFILES!!! Eradicate the trolls!!!
Your job as president is to boost our ecconmy a wall would put us in a recession. Meanwhile China is trying declare war on us while your trying to separate us from our neighbors downsouth with the border wall money you can spend on our military defense to keep us safe from an imment attack from the Chinese government instead of making America a luxurious country which would be spoiled by mistreatment on one another as Americans.
Maybe get mexico to pay for it and stop being a crybaby bitch?After all,that was the promise,was it not?
It was a stupid, narcissistic promise with no basis in fact.
Feds want paid you fucking blonde turd
I hope you will be able to clean DC.. Hoping you have all the evidence to make them all go to jail!!
Build the wall and enforce the laws!
Build the wall that's all what matter.
Dem-rats are worried that TRUMP will be the one that builds the wall! They want it...but they don't want his name attached to it. What a great achievement for the president to pull this off. History baby!
You said Mexico was going to pay for wall not taxpayers they got tunnels people are stupid Trump a idiot president liar
You said Mexico was going to pay for wall not taxpayers they got tunnels people are stupid Trump a idiot president liar
Well USA is being plundered, and the fatality of legal persons is a devastating issue! As if WE Vets, and American born for generations...have no rights!  On a footnote, its very personal when one of your blood is drugged, raped in a horrible beating..violent enough to remove memory, physical  assault on entire body, robbed, left in a ditch like in a Biblical chapter. Barely lived, never the same. 4,000 in '16, '17 never talked again.  They had to be buried. 4,000 Americans unaccounted for, and not suspected of being indigent! The pirates are here by the tens of thousands of all nationalities and causes.
Just do it.  Sick of all this political positioning, wasted time and money.  GET IT DONE!  It's time to stand and protect our country and citizens.
Just find the 50 Billion dollars they were suppose to already have allocated then use that. Maybe Schumer and Pelosi pocketed some to build walls around their property. Investigate how they both became rich on their salary. Start taking money back from all of them for misuse of funds. I am sure they will help fund the wall then.
Schumer & Pelosi lying... as usual...misrepresenting the entire issue!!! Their deceits are being seen...their once sheep are starting to turn in to wolves hungry for retribution to being lied to and deceived for so long by these globalists socialist commies!   My response: Mr. President...DO NOT END THE SHUTDOWN UNTIL YOU GET THAT WALL!!! They all SAID they supported it when it got them votes...hold these liars to their words now!
BUILD THAT WALL.  If the Democrats want to push you, they better wake up out of their dream. You've got the rest of us standing behind you.
Nancy and Chuck are rebellious, anti-American, pathetic excuses for 'Leaders' when they refuse to 'offer solutions' to this situation...OH Thats' right, they can't think on their own and are not creative enough to come up with anything....did I mention brainless. I hate how they are anti American and we pay them! They are to serve and protect, not abuse and accuse, and its immoral to support Illegal activities and Illegal people. Thir JOB is to serve and protect Americans!! Treasonous!
Build the wall. Don't let them win or America will lose.
Build the wall, keep our borders secure!
Build that wall!  Fix those horrible immigration laws!
I thought you said Mexico was paying for the wall? Stop holding hard working Americans hostage for your personal gain...treasonous bastard! And, when did you idiots get conned into believing we needed a wall? Pathetic followers.
Ashamed of this immoral Congress!  They are ignoring the core value of the Constitution to serve and protect the citizens by valuing illegal immigrants over the welfare and safety over its own citizens
Build the wall, give Daca kids a path to citizenship, establish a program for all current illegals to obtain citizenship by paying a fee, requirement to take a constitution class and English classes, and a path to make them tax paying and off government free programs within a time period or deport them!
Yes we want borders secured..Democrats need to vote for this..or get voted out of office.!
Let's see what the ratio of smart/morons are in this country. Let's hope we can outvote the morons who want FREE STUFF and are clueless as to WHO PAYS FOR IT. Those who want SOCIALISM don't want the wall.  Those who want SOVEREIGNTY (a free country) WANT THE WALL.  All you people who want socialism why don't you just pack your bags, get the hell out and leave the rest of us patriots alone. You socialists ARE A DISGRACE TO OUR COUNTRY AND EVERYTHING IT STANDS FOR. Now... GET OUT!!! Go find a country that share YOUR values!!!!
The democrats and most of the republicans want America destroyed. They want this country to be communist.
this brain dead jackass is blowing gas over his address while americans are suffering
we have to now worry about canada boarders too that fool up there is letting everyone in too. travel ban on America safety first. how soon those celb snowflakes forget 911.
Piss on Shitmer(Schumer). Keep it shut down. We support you Mr. President!!!
build the wall !!!!!!!!! I'm so sick of hearing people say that there is no crisis on our borders. there sure as hell is. if you don't think so then take some of the people coming over and let them live in your house.
Stupid wall idea! Open the government you big ass child
Try forming an actual sentence before you call someone stupid.

Take the Dems out to the trash and get these Muslims out of govt office
Thank you President Trump. The answer is obvious and many sound-minded citizens know the answer. GOD HELP those who can only insult and obstruct. Here's a bible verse: see if it resonates with anyone and can show a minute ability to abstain from vulgarity. I probably don't want your opinion anyway. Jesus said, "Satan has come to only steal, kill, and destroy." You don't have to be a genius to see that one side is BUILDING and the other just intends to DESTROY and do everything harmful. My peace comes from knowing that GOD knows. Drunken, idiotic words and behavior do not escape him. The people have done nothing but harm our government MUST repent and turn from their wicked ways instead of taking a BIG FAT PAYCHECK for doing harm. Many don't like that their tax payer-money is going to drunken fools who hate God and people. So, dear President, TAKE HEART, because no vulgar language will stop our prayers or make God LESS than GOD. Every person is a "vapor, a mist." Jesus said you don't know if you one more hour on earth. Take His wise words, obstructionists, and REPENT. He will forgive and replace your heart of stone with one that is soft toward him and others. It's a better deal than what the Dems. have going. TAKE IT.
It doesn‚Äôt matter what you want for our country the Democrats will not agree with you.  You have done more for us in a long time. The democrats are so stupid and only care about themselves and not what is best for our country.   #prayforourpeesident
You are JUST A LIAR!! You‚Äôve never kept a promise in your life. Why? You can careless for anyone of us!
Don't use my tax money to build no damn wall. You said in your campaign that Mexico was going to pay for the wall now your saying the wall will pay for itself through a trade deal. I don't care of you are a Republican or a Democrat This man has shut down the government and people are unable to pay mortgages and provide food for their children and you have the nerve to talk about all the killings of women and children. During your campaign you didn't give a rats ass about women or children. Jesus fight this battle because it is yours I'm just disgusted and sick to my stupid because he has the never to talk am humanity
Damn mainstream media ...sick of them lieing.....and screw Schumer and Pelosi ....lieing bitches
Y'all are some idiot's. You telling him to fund the wall with your moneyü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Just so you all know God is not the illustrator of confusion. This man is confused. I guess it will hit y'all when you can't take care of your families.

You have already broken your "promise." Mexico will not pay for this wall, fence, or barrier. And now you think it's A-OK to saddle Americans with this foolish thing. It will not be a wall in tribute to you, you egocentric idiot.
Oh Mr.President they rather see you fail then coming together and helping our Country.If you fixed everything and made it great again.They wouldnt know what to do with themselves....IDIOTS!!
Everyone should start flooding all Democrats in Washington to BUILD THE WALL.  Calls, emails, faxes whatever!
Trump is a dumb ass. He clawing for what $5 billion dollars for a wall. A bipartisan bill was presented to him last year with $25 billion for the wall. This in exchange for DACA. Trump rejected it. Trump is an idiot savant. Even if I had voted for this jerk I would feel the same way.
Just to be clear I do not want you spending my tax dollars and a stupid fucking wall. Thank god the Democrats are there to block you. I hope they have the conviction and courage to stand their ground in the face of you and your half-wit base.

Build the wall mr president  God bless America and piss on the dam democrats
Linda Lynch you know that isn't the only issue. If an American commits murder, they are prosecuted and laws are put in place. Your point is silly.
LaVerne M PhillipsLast year in the U.S. over 12,000 people were shot and killed by American citizens and Trump fights tooth and nail to prevent any common sense gun control. About a half dozen people are killed by undocumented aliens and Trump demands that we spend billions of dollars building a wall. I guess he doesn't think that it matters if your child is killed by a fellow American....I guess he thinks you will only mourn for them if they are killed by an undocumented person.
Linda Lynch build that wall!!!!!!

We all want security but the wall isn't going to fix anything. This isn't the Ming Dynasty. We don't have hordes of Mongols pillaging our towns. It didn't work then or now.
The Democrats don‚Äôt care about the American people they care about their pockets and that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs it they don‚Äôt care whether we live or die you Mr. President care and that concerns them get in there and get the job done we got a boost these Democrats out of office
We need the wall in Somalia please come and build
BUILD THE DAMN WALL! It's OUR money, OUR country and OUR wall!
Declare a national emergency president.. we stand firm with you. We know that anyone with common sense knows we need a secure border. The Democrats are the ones causing the shutdown.  They just gave millions  to Europe for abortions but zero for safety for Americans safety.  All country's need secure borders ,just as we need protection and safety in our own homes  we need the wall   Build the WALL.
Americans want their fucking paychecks clown
Border! Term limits for these idiots.
You have conflated ‚Äúborder security‚Äù with a wall that won‚Äôt work, you incompetent buffoon. Resign and play some golf before your prison sentence.
What's most important to Americans is stopping you from screwing us out of our tax dollars to build your stupid f'king wall so you can repay your debt to Russia by way of "US Steel" provided by Evras North America, whose parent company is Evras and 31% owned by Russian billionaire, Trump family friend and close Putin ally, Roman Abromavich. No doubt, also, your motivation to place tariffs on steel from outside North America.  YOU SUCK!
Yes we need borarder security. I have no problem with imgrants comming into America. If they get background checks and come in the correcy way. Legaly!!!. Become a Us citizen and that means in all ways Honor our nation and our flag learn to speak english. Work and pay taxes like I do.obey the laws of our Great Land. They adapt to our nation not us,to there ways. Yes serve in our militaryif of age to do so.
U SAID U MAKE MEXICO PAY FOR THAT WALL U LIAR. PAY FOR THAT WALL U RICH FUCKER.

build that wall, the hell with snowflakes, it's not the money, the amount is relatively less than a drop in the bucket, it's because they do not want TRUMP to succeed, they are forgetting about WE THE PEOPLE, they don't give a fk, they only care about control and power!!!! WE don't count

Steve Pecenka you were the one being a condescending little prick talking about my intelligence. I reversed it and merely explained why I do the symbols lol .
Micheal Marceaux LOL-Sure Mike. Having to use emojis to express your deep thoughts is a sure sign of intellect.I'll bet you're every bit as smart as the orange buffoon in the oval office. You know, the idiot who claims every word, every stupid action, is the biggest, the best, in the history of the world. Only a lying, insecure, narcissistic stable genius  feels the need to constantly proclaim what a genius he is. So yes, you're pretty intelligent using the tRumpie yardstick.
Steve Pecenka Its my way of cursing you out without getting banned . So yeah I am pretty intelligent lol. Its fun and therapeutic at the same time . We all know yall got üêímonkey brains I give out üçå
Oh, ouch, what a cutting reply, Mikey! Just what I'd expect from a highly intelligent tRumpie, though!

You got the first part right, Cheeto. Stopping your incompetent, traitorous ass from hurting this country any further should be priority number one!
You don‚Äôt have to build a wall to secure the borders you fucking dumb prick!
Too many clowns responding.  Hello dumbasses, we have thousands entering ILLEGALLY.
Your promise is about as good as your marriage vows. What happened to Mexico will pay for the wall, I promise. Your an ASSHAT.
All you Trump supporter believe everything that Assclown tall you if you all was so freaking bloody Smart you would Fact check everything
More then 6000 murders and  1 million unique crimes committed by illegal immigrants since 2008..  is a national emergency. Hopefully you have people putting these statistics together so you can show them to the nation during your address.

You should get Chucky and Nancy to accompany you on your border trip, and maybe get a first-hand idea about what is needed, from the people working the front lines every single day. Last set of interviews I heard, every border official said the wall would help IMMENSELY. Of course, I might be foolishly optimistic that these two clowns would pay any attention to people that are actually working the problem. I can dream, right?
They want to stop You My President. You and Your Administration has outed them and they are feeling how naked they really are. I stand with You! Your not alone. Stand Strong! Pelosi & Schumer look like fools. They like their time in front of a camera. They talk the talk but can‚Äôt walk the walk. I can‚Äôt wait till they are all on the debate stage. The Garbage they spew and blame others for what they themselves are guilty of.
Eric E. Murdaa umm yes we do ...(actual american)
Actual American here. WE DO NOT WANT THE WALL.   There‚Äôs thousands of things that 5 billion could be better spend on then a half ass wall.   Also, why are there so many Non-Americans saying ‚ÄúBest President Ever?‚Äù...... Trumps vocal fan base is a bunch of fake accounts. Trump‚Äôs cabinet is guilty.   Real Americans value human life. This isn‚Äôt Russia
Build the wall it only can help
I suggest someone raid Pelosi's vineyards.. You'd find lots of undocumented immigrants there
Build the wall protect america
Build the wall Stay shutdown until they fully fund the wall
We want border safety. Build the wall!!! Democrats you really know how to make yourselves look stupid!!!!! üò† üò†
we have 20 to 30 million illegals in OUR country now. How many will be enough for you 100 million? The Democrats will be happy when the USA has collapsed and they can start their Marxist country.
I have also written several nasty letters to my very liberal senators regarding thier support of Israel.
Yes, just like I was against Obama's high level of deportations and his use of drones.
Kimberley Gray  so if this was Obama asking for funding for a wall, would you still be against it?
SIT DOWN DON, YOU FAT MOTHERFUCKER!!!Play Video
Thank you President TRUMP,  hopefully these two will slither under their rock, they are both Evil, and look like they are  demonic, they would rather see U.S fail, then do,the right thing
Of course Americans want a Border Wall.  Are we blinded by the "Proven" fact of what is going on?  Do we want the continuous invasion of thousands of migrants forcing their way illegally into our country, throwing rocks and carrying their flag as a tribe of warriors ?  What's next, a fleet with guns?  We are beyond reason enough to build a wall.  We are disgusted  with different strains of diseases, gangs, riots and rude people with the audacity of making demands in "our" country.  I despise the attitude of illegals who disrespect our President and interfere in American citizens democracy and voting system. I am tired of being abused with the responsibility placed upon us to care for these phony asylum seekers, while we have our own unfortunate needy citizens who more than deserve their share of help.  Yes we want a wall.  Keep us a safe, clean and beautiful society.  We love you President Trump ‚ù£Ô∏è

Dems don‚Äôt care they just want to bitch and tell lies keep up t great work mr president and ty
Blows my mind that anyone would be against border security! This has nothing to do with asylum, everyone will still be able to apply - only they'll have to do it legally instead of after sneaking into our country. The media is so full of false narratives and there are so many who can't think for themselves! And the whole "I thought Mexico was going to pay for it" they (Mexico)  just realized that if there's a wall, all those that should be kept out will be stuck in their country! They don't want the bad seeds either!!

F u
Fat ass stated a few illegal immigrants that murdered American citizens but fail to mention the numerous domestic terrorism killings by a thousand fold....mostly white. Lying motherf.cker.
The democrats are  disgraceful and hypocrites. They all wanted the wall, they got money ey for a wall that was never built, 46 billion to be exact where did that money go? Is that why they are multi millionaires on a 174 k a year job? People need to open their eyes about the democrats. They care nothing for the people. Their hatred is fueled by Satan because God is love . Support the democrats and you‚Äôre supporting Satan
If everyone else put this country first and quit obstructing, we‚Äôd all be doing a whole lot better. People that are so jealous of the rich keep shooting themselves in the feet trying to raise taxes on their own employers. Put your extended hand back in your own pockets, go to work, and pay for what you want! Fake News and Fake Humanitarianism is the enemy of this country!
You are the President of the Nation of Republicans and Democrats in the USA.  Please do not discuss "Democrats' problems" tonight in your speech to the nation.  Please address the need to secure America from drugs, criminals, disease, etc. coming across the Southern border costing Americans much more than $5.6B through building the Wall.  Classifying "Democrats" as the problem only adds fuel to this never- ending fire.  So many support the construction of this Wall, so please emphasize the positive aspects and eliminate the negative (including name calling, etc.)  You will win only by taking the high road on this issue.  Best wishes!

Your promise was that Mexico would pay for it. If Mexico isn't paying for it then we're done with this conversation about the stupid wall. It's time that you fund the government so that American government employees can pay their bills.

Oh yeah more white men have killed people in this country than undocumented citizens. I dont care if you want a wall or not but find a different reason as to why you want it.

Why can't we Send those who have to do Court ordered community Service work or who are incarcerated and in the overcrowed prisions that taxpayers are paying for to clean up the trash in the National parks.  They get paid 3 square meals a day, a bed, a roof over their head, libraries, gyms, tvs and game rooms...  There is No reason they shouldn't be put immediatly on a guarded clean up detail.  They can re pay with Civil Service duties. Put the tracker ankle bracelets & wrist bands on  them while being watched with armed guards and put them in tgere to do clean up work.  However ... It's a shame people cant take a trash bag in on their own or are so lazy and not more considerate to pick up after themselves to begin with.
Let the man do his damn job the American people voted this man in and he kept every promise he made! Build the wall keep out the heroin influx, illegal people we know nothing about, murders, etc.
build wall with armed guards to shoot
I‚Äôm so sick of the disrespect & disregard for our country. When 2 members of the people‚Äôs house stand in front of our nation and spew hate using buzzwords like hostage, temper tantrums, fear...... we have a huge problem. I challenge Pelosi & Schumer to spend ONE week, night & day at our southern border with our border agents & tell that same story. In fact, that should be mandatory to their election of office. And why in God‚Äôs name, do we the American people allow a newly elected congresswoman to disrespect our president and the office she holds??? We are circling the drain as a nation. Sad sad sad üò¢

Build the wall. Don't wait on the Democrats. Bill every adult $150, even illegal immigrants working here. Then reimburse legal citizens the $150 after we are in a National State of Emergency.
Oh go on build the wall, it'll keep all you Trump-loving idiots in üòÇüêê
Dont  give  in  to  their  bullshit.  My  lights  are  on,  trash  was  picked  up,  water  still  running.  Keep  it  shut  down  till  congress  funds  the  wall.
trump is a fear monger!  trump must be impeach immediately, so that America can recover from trump's destructive actions!
Why is Chuck Schumer always with evil Pelosi ??! Both evil
Afforable healthcare is more important you narcissist!
Afforable healthcare is more important you narcissist!
Hey! You actually said something with some truth in it!!! Americans do want border security! That's what Democrats are standing up for! They want methods that are more likely to be effective than your huge wall. They are willing to continue talks about border security - which don't have to include a government shutdown. They had agreed to a funding package that included money for wall repair and some building, where applicable, but you refused to budge unless they totally capitulated to your demands for funding your wall. Way to show you care about our people - not!  Democrats are quite willing to work on improving border security. They also want legal immigration, rather than illegal immigration. But calling anyone coming to our borders "illegals" is not right. They are only "Illegals" if they try to avoid the vetting process. There is a lot of work needed to improve the immigration situation, but your stubborn insistence upon doing it only your way will get nowhere fast.
I want the wall .  You know why? So many of us latinos come over here to escape the craziness of our home countries. Why do we want that same craziness infiltrating America? You gotta be a special kind of stupid or you must really hate America with a passion and want it to fall.
Ignore Pelosi and the nittwitts.... BUILD THE WALL!  We see how she stands for the red, white and blue by her actions against our veterans just this past week.  She‚Äôs trash....worthless. Can‚Äôt stand her.
Build the wall declare a National emergancy
Does anyone ever check out the stats on the likes, angry, funny, sad etc.... on these posts. Maybe all the liberals should get a clue. Americans do want the wall and immigration reform. We simply cannot sustain this country with this many immigrants pouring in and costing american's all sorts of funds. We have our own citizens living on the streets, children going to bed hungry, and drugs. Don't need more coming here for us to deal with. DO IT LEGALLY!
Americans should be happy. In canada our dumbass leader has turned the country into a jesus homeless shelter. We're taking everyone in and paying them to come here. Its astounding how it's even happening.
Ok we are down with border security ..............but.........your wall is fucking dumb.
Next send all ‚Äòrefugees‚Äô back to their home where they can elect and give Pelosi citizenship in their country to be President and steal their tax dollars.
That was really ignorant Marilyn Weiner..  Why do we need sanctuary cities for illegals if we're all supposed to be so safe.??  This is our country not theirs..  I have rights also..

If DONALD TRUMP THINKS IMMIGRANTS ARE SO DANGEROUS, WHY DOES HE KEEP MARRYING THEM?
Build the Wall, it should have been built a long time ago!!!
Build the Wall, it should have been built a long time ago!!!
Being a trump supporter must be a lot like being an abused woman in an abusive relationship, no matter how many times you get punched in the face all the I'm sorry's and I love you's make it ok, it must be a psychological reaction to not being able to let go of it, trump supporters feel committed at this point because you all voted for him, fought for him, argued for him, and now you see what a failure he is being president, being a human being, being a descent person and caring when he doesn't, yeah trump supporters, YOU ARE the beaten woman in the relationship, and trump is is the abuser who says sorry it will never happen again!! and you just stay with him again and again and again...
Chump your such a liar.   https://news.gallup.com/poll/235775/americans-oppose-border-walls-favor-dealing-daca.aspx
No, Americans don‚Äôt. Just idiots who buy your bullshit
Fulfill your promise that Mexico will pay for your stupid wall!
Your Promise was for Mexico to pay for the Wall, your a liar.
just listen 2 silly Nancy , now that other idiot , don't know his name , just a idiot , wot a tool , stand firm Donnie , good move against the EU yesterday thanks !
It's so easy for those who don't live on the border to not want a wall, to say we dont need it. They dont live on the border they dont have to deal with drug smugglers, rapists or human traffickers breaking into their homes. If you dont want a wall a DARE YOU to move to the border and leave your doors open!!! I guarantee you'll be singing a different tune in just a short few days. You dont care for american citizens safety then you're not an american!!!  Daddy president put the crying tantrum toddlers in a corner and now they're pissed of about it. Libtards Sucked on Obamas tits for too long and got coddled!!!
Screw these filthy Democrats ... cancer of this country, the filthy pigs!!!
Build the wall! Get rid of those who say no! Wish it worked that way anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
With all the monies that have been giving to the Bushes, Clintons, Obummer all these years for border security and I'm not talking about 5b we're talking about 100's of billions, why are we having this problem? Answer...it's used to do what they said it was going to be used for, but they give it to companies  they have intrest in and get kick backs from it, ( you know like give the contracts to family members) It's away to keep these billions of dollars going. Now they know that there is someone who will use every penny to fix this problem. And no need for all these bilions every year. That and a loss of illigal votes
Drugs seized at THE PORT not BORDER. #NoWall   End #TrumpShutDown   https://6abc.com/$17-million-worth-of-fentanyl-seized-at-port-of-philadelphia/3690305/
Democrats say drugs are all being stopped at the border crossing.  Just shows how dumb they really are.
Donald Trump Jr is tied to El Chapo's Mexican drug cartel. These photos prove it. The same Latvian banker Don Jr is in photos with also was behind a massive Russian money laundering scheme as well. Because, of course he was.   https://thesternfacts.com/trump-jr-now-tied-to-mexican-drug-cartels-money-laundering-scheme-5906b8d4ce5d
We overstand you don't have to be Smart to talk to your Ignorant Cult members. They'd rather have $5 Billion for a irrelevant Wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for, than $3 Billion for Health care. I wish 45 the "Pied Piper for Imbeciles" would cut Food Stamps and Welfare so the 60% of his cult members that receive them would starve to death.
I want the wall. I want Polos I out of office along with her side kick. All the democrats who won't work with you Mr. President . their only agenda is to destroy you. You need to start playing hard ball and clean the swamp out. Please

I can tell you. You would blame Trump! Probably because the wall wasn't built fast enough!
Seems to me the people who don't want border security are the same people who should be on the other side of the wall. I see your dumb smiling faces. Let me ask you... what if your mother, sister, brother..etc was raped or killed by an illegal? Or for that matter overdosed on one of the many drugs coming from Mexico. Where would you stand then?
Hawaii Harbors Illegal immigrants!!!!!!  Then Hawaii asks the Federal money, that they separately need because of the Unions who hold Citizens of Hawaii hostage: State Workers Union, Stevadores Union, police Union, hotel workers union, stage workers and film workers union, who all make more than the Teachers Union.  Everyone wants to work for a Union for retirement.  And Union Heads want power.  Prices go up.  Hawaii residents have to pay the ship yard workers union in San Diego and again in Hawaii before they can go to the store for toilet paper.  So Hawaii‚Äôs Government asks the Federal government for money, ‚Äúbecause Hawaii is using its precious space for The Marines, Navy, Army and Airforce.‚Äù  Who suffers, the Tourists, Hawaii residents, and Hawaii‚Äôs Public School System is the worst.
In my lifetime I have never seen members of the Democrat party act this trashy and void of class. This is shameful, and we need to bring back some integrity and diginty to our goverment. What is going on? Whatever it is, let's work it out for the sake of our country.

Pelosi and shummer are as big a threat as illegals crossing our boarders because they are domestic threats they need to be behind walls and bars. Drain the swamp
Now Hawaii can make money off of Hawaiian grown marijuana and maybe we can open some new prisons.  Democrats have not given us, United States Citizens, Financial Security, so they are now offering Socialism.  I‚Äôm not following their parade
You deranged mofo  Its no reason to shutdown the government
We want border security and our tax dollars to stop paying for all these illegals who come here plop their babies out and expect us to pay for them, they were born while their parents committed a crime, they should be considered illegal as well. We are the ones forced to feed, educate and give til our own go without.
This country is going to hell in a hand basket. People claim they don't see color, we're all one race or that "all lives matter" those are the same people that are all in for this wall. Do you know the type of stuff people have to do to smuggle drugs in this country? Every race steals, kills, and lies. Do I hate Trump? No, but I don't care for his vulgarity either. It's not his fault that people are falling for the okeydoke though. People should have a mind of their own. I'm neither Democrat or Republican, I'm a human being that has empathy and compassion for those who are suffering. A Mexican man (who was legal born and bred) told me the conditions living in Mexico, and they're barbaric. Of course people want to come to America, the supposed land of the free and home of the brave, the same way people wanted to escape from England and ended up here. How do we know that the Native Americans didn't have a law about illegals entering in their country?
Campaign promise is circumstantial to factual problem: Social and Financial due to illegal immigration and illegal harboring of illegal aliens.
Build the wall!!!!! We need to secure our border. #maga
we have to get rid of these democrats...and at this point I don't care how it's done....
Build the wall üëçüôè keep pushing it. Or declare natural disaster and build anyway. Wonder how much cartel $ they getting to fight this üòâüëç
Exactly! What Is important to the Dems?? Aside from stomping around over every little thing you say and do, the asshats look completely freaking bananas and might I add, far removed from the reality that is the American People.
LIAR. No, law enforcement did NOT request 5.6B for a wall. NO, Dems did not ask for a wall and then change their minds when Trump was elected. NO, drugs do NOT flood over the border with illegals, and no wall will change that.
They all need to visit the border and walk along it for awhile - see the places where there is not much to keep the dangerous ones from just walking into the USA.  I think they're all too chicken to walk along the border - it's a dangerous place!
You are an idiot! You said that the woman who said, "Impeach the Mother f'r" was sooo horrible. Seriously dude???? You also said that on national television. So dont go and diss someone for exactly what you did. It is hypocritical. You would think that a so called POTUS wouldnt say that on national television either !! Have some respect for yourself.
Donald Trump is creating a political problem to win up coming election....... he just manufacture his own problem with lies , hate and deceit turning a brother against brother nations against nations manipulation they ignorant for political and selfish gain.....
Hold the LINE SIR! These Evil bad actors THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT ANYONES LIFE...Just look at what Pelosis district is criminal drug infested street scum ...she lines her Bank account with foreign aid funds ...AUDIT  Sure Schumers is a well..SOROS PENGUIN PUPPET!
Mr President, I think you know the answer. Forgive those that are too stupid to recognize taking responsibility. They dont take responsibility, they toss it on others and try to shame them for it. THe American people are on your side!
Keep your promise and have Mexico pay for the wall you goddamned liar.
Keep your promise and have Mexico pay for the wall you goddamned liar.
The last 3 presidents started wars in other countries that created no benefit to the American people, and we paid for them.  Trump wants to actually do something for our country that would benefit the America people and half the country hates him for it. What a time to be alive in politics.
I bet a ton of money with my bookie that trump will lie 53 times in 8minutes. I need the money since the government is shut down. Come on trump don‚Äôt let me down you lying bag of üí©ü§û
Obstructionist PIGS, give the American people what they want . . . BUILD THE WALL!
Democrats stop being difficult...you are all a bunch of traders to America and Federal Government.  Shame on you.  I believe we the people are going need the vote to shut you down.  If you Democrat‚Äôs continue to leave our borders unlawfully open....all the terrible tragedies will hit in your families.  Don‚Äôt you love your own families?  Stop being stubborn like children.  Help your loved ones and America.  You Democrats are hiding information you don‚Äôt want leaked out to America or your families.
No fascist USA, no police state, no hate. You sir embody everything that is wrong with this country. You are a con, a fake. You care only about yourself, you are constantly backpedaling. You are a disgrace to this country and the people. Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, F.D.R, Kennedy, those were great presidents that helped this country. That care about enough. You sir, are the biggest charlatan, ever.

All the foolishness about a crisis that does not exist is to divert about the indictments that will include Chump and Chump Jr. Little Donny half scoop met with Russian agents during campaign. Collusion and obstruction is a real thing. You idiots can believe all the lies if you want. Chump knows his goose is cooked. REAL Americans will take back our country. All you traitors can stick with Chump .
Arizona native here, and I am SICK of watching our communities turn into Mexico.  CLOSE THE BORDER! BUILD THE FUCKIN WALL!!!!
Build the wall. Keep pushing forward. USA!!
Do not believe one word of what N. P. and C. S. say.  . If you open the government, They will tell you to take a flying leap.    Stick to your guns.  Why don‚Äôt they acknowledge that you are asking for 5.7 billion to build a Wall but it is costing 150 billion a year to support the illegals.   Even without counting the crime, drugs, diseases, terrorist, etc, that is coming across our southern border.    It‚Äôs a ‚ÄúNo Brainer‚Äù  for a reasonable thinking person. Why are they putting illegals needs over American citizens needs..  They took an Oath to uphold the Constitution of The United States of Americat but they seem to be violating that sacred Oath By not protecting and taking care of American citizens over illegals.
Build it over Congress approval, nothing will turn people against you more than if they cannot pay their bills , put food on their table , pay their rent... no matter how loyal they are ..because it is human nature and survival THEY'LL turn on you.... it's not that they will just blame the Democrats they will start to blame you.
Buddie americans dont want a stupid wall, they want livable wages, free health care, affordable education, etc . Thats what Americans want.
Your a damned lier! Take responsibility for your actions
Many from the GOP as well, you troglodyte.
You could have the cure for cancer or the solution to world peace and the Democrats will still try and stop you !
Build the Wall! Declare National Emergency!
Build it and move the liberals to Mexico
You are scum A small hand small dick Scum slum lord
Dear Mr president. If you Arrest and imprison Americans who knowingly hire Illegals you wont have a border problem. You cant put a wall around an open honey pot and expect to keep the ants out. Likewise make Drugs legal and treat Addicts. (no money = no smuggle) End welfare for Illegals and arrest Commie state politicians who hand our tax money to Illegals. So tell me what is wrong with my plan?.

Instead of shutting down government benefits, let's shut down illegal alien benefits!
Has anyone thought of cutting the incentives for them to come here illegally? Asking for a friend.
JIM.  THE PRESIDENT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO PROTECT AMERICA AND CAN BUILD A WALL SON. GET COMFY ;)
38 is not even near enough to half the voting public you idiot !  To claim America anything you must have at least 50 percent of the voting public supporting you and you do not !  Your a lair !  4,000 terrorist turns into 12 suspected and only 6 at the southern border , the drugs come in cars and thru the 60 tunnels we have found , your wall is stupidity and nothing more !  That's why 62 percent of us know it and are opposing you !  And over 50 percent are calling for your impeachment so yes America wants you gone , not a wall , four walls around you called a jail cell !
Disgraceful that Democrats have no compassion for the killings of innocent Americans by Illegals. reaction
I thought Mexico  was paying for the wall,  so when are you going to clean up the large inner cities,  rapes, murders, drugs, suicides, Americans Terrorists, Catholics children being molested,  and this is coming from Americans.....

Stopping you from perpetrating fraud with your bogus wall which you support with untruthful claims and statistics. You are a pathological liar.
Lost my daughter Thursday night from drugs. Build the wall to keep out Illegals, drugs and human trafficking.
Build the walll...dont cave to lunatics
I think every city should have check points for illegal immigrants along with the wall ...If democrats want to hinder the wall being built then start by showing the American people just how many illegal immigrants are already here
You are destroying America Trump
Do you people who are egging him on to build the wall, understand what you will lose if that money is directed there? You're all ignorant dimwits! Please understand the consequences of putting up 5 Billion Dollars for this ridiculous wall. Who do you think he's going to get to build it? Will he create a business of his own? So HE can profit. Or will he give it to one of his mates who will pay Trump a percentage, personally, just to gain the job? There's way more to this than what Trump is saying Factual Stats show immigration at the southern border is at its lowest. How can you just accept everything he says? He is a lying, criminal conman!
Democrats don‚Äôt want a wall because they love border crashers more than they love AMERICANS.  Democrats are evil. Protect illegal children while approve murdering legal American babies. 100% evil.
They are brainwashed by evilness Freeze freebies to ilegals. They will plea Pelosi n schummer for wall.
Democrats are biggest idiotic threat to America
The only thing on the minds of the democrats is to get rid of the President and they will do anything and will not stop because they are afraid of him
Protect the nation ‚Äî- build the wall and do all other measures to protect our country.  Spend our tax money on USA CITIZENS.
Yes Mr President our country need our walls to prevent tragedies to our children and women and against every America citizens. This has started by obama changing our immigration laws to allow immigrants to enter our country illegally and able to stay and get free everything. And over congress which didn‚Äôt stop him. Just like everything he has done for them and not for the citizens. And because they themselves said they was for security and protection at our border and have a wall to keep out immigrate but to deport those here as well. So have they. Not as much as they should have. Plus it is what democrats want to do for our border but refuse to just because of who is our President.
We stand with you POTUS!!! Build the wall and expose these liars and evil deep state to the world!!  Lets do it!!
Getting your batshit crazy ass out of the White House. Criminal incompetent fool.
There is one way and one way only to get them back for all the hell they put this President through..
They know when you cut their voters from running the border......they are finished. You are just one step away from making the Communist Democrat party a prehistoric fossil. They will dry up like water on a hot 120 degree day when the flow stops. They know it!!
Stopping you from lying to the American public Stupid!!!  https://youtu.be/-yfIxBjOw3o
Gambling sites are taking odds as to how many times this fucker is going to lie to the American people tonight.. I say every other word will be LIES since he's a PATHOLOGICAL LIAR
Lets build that mother fucker.... Ill lay the first fucking brick
It funny how Shumer calls it a tantrum .. It takes two and I feel like Shumer and pelosi are acting like bullies and babies. They act like Trump alone can stop the shutdown..What's wrong with them giving the money and putting people back to work.. They act like Americans are stupid... Pay for the wall and get people back to work OR you going to act like babies and act like it's only up to Trump.. When the truth is You two could stop the shutdown and put people back to work today.. Voters need to remember this and Vote you out of office

Shut the hell up, what about the KKK or the people right here in America, you are a disgrace using the wrong people for this wall!!!!!
The dumocrats are like selfish children, no I take tat back,  it's worse. They're committing treason against the U.S.
Getting your ass handed to you by Pelosi and Schumer!
Getting your ass handed to you by Pelosi and Schumer!
Build that wall and build it the way you want it . Screw them Dems and Libs .
Build it and they won't come....Build that wall build it tall.
Americans have been BEGGING to seal that border since at least 1986 and both parties have FAILED.  Why do we even pay these people?? They completely destroy everything they get their filthy hands on and then try and.convince us they're doing us a big favor.  And democrats are the worst of them two evils by far. Their insane "sanctuary" policies are KILLING Americans and bleeding us dry financially.  Build the freaking wall and seal the border already.  Chuck and Nancy need to get the hell out of the way and let Americans get to work and get it done..
Build the wall and use the stroke of ink pen. It would of been nice if the Democrats would work together. They refuse to help
First evidence shows that the caravan moving north was initiated by social media spread by republicans to give Trump another reason for fear mongering before the midterm elections.
Build the wall and secure our borders üòäüëçüèª
Build the wall, NO amnesty, STOP allowing them to enter,why do we need to provide 52K beds and medical treatment, these foreign invaders are bankrupting America. STOP ALL welfare to illegal aliens and refugees and make it retroactive, get them out.
We have literally been promised a border wall by spineless politicians for the last 30 years, and we're tired of being lied to by the government we fund. Get it done once and for all.
This fight with con man Don isn't about border security. It's about the symbolism of a wall as a metaphor for demonizing nonwhite immigrants and immigrants from [expletive] countries. It's about the final statement in the narrative to protect America from changing demographics.  "Make America Great Again" was never about great. It was about white.  No imminent threat from undocumented immigrants exists. Illegal immigration has been falling for the last two decades, and it was at its lowest in 2017. Half of illegal immigrants don't cross illegally but rather overstay a visa that was secured legally. Those who say illegal immigrants pose a threat to police and American citizens ‚Äî just another exaggeration. Studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a rate that is 85 percent less than native-born individuals.  #TRUMPSHUTDOWN!!!
Dow is where it was one year ago, deficit is approaching ONE TRILLION DOLLARS, National debt is 22 TRILLION, Ford is laying off 20.000 workers, gas is up to 3 Dollars and interest rates go up rapidly. Lower and middle class people don¬¥t have one penny more in their pocket, but rich people got tax cuts !!! Great work of the orange CLOWN !!
Dont back up an dont back down..full steam ahead Trump .if they stay in your way become a John deere mower an mow them duckers down..
Yes, he needs our prayer. Prayer works and God will make a show of all this evilness. We are in the fiery furnace and God sent Donald Trump to protect us. Thank You, Lord, for giving us a President who truly cares about our nation and its people. Protect him and may everything he puts his hand to prosper. Even now, the Democrats stand fast in their wickedness. All liars go to Hell. They need to rethink what they are doing. When this is all said and done, God will triumph and we are his people so we will share in the glory. In the mighty Name of Jesus Christ, I submit this evil unto thee, my God. May Your glory and honor shine so bright. The blind cannot see and evil has only evil to protect it.

hey ted cruz is offering a solution. please look at it. build the wall using other money and F the democrats. they are showing the rest of the country how useless they really are!
It's truly sad that the democrats hate Trump so much that they risk all of our American citizens safety. To hate one person so much and put so many in danger while they live behind their gated walls! And to top it off to want open borders for illegals to come into our country and get benefits that American citizens can't even get! Power hungry democrats want that almighty vote and the only way to get it is to keep the border open and have illegals vote for them!
Impeaching and locking you up, motherfucker!!
It would appear, don, that only half of America is behind you The other half seem to think you're a moron
This foreign Institution has been doing Financial business with Donald Trump and the Russians. This is the tie. This is the proof. This is the Big Kahuna. But you guys just keep on getting distracted by the stupid wall but make no mistake, he knows all about this and he has been fighting this tooth and nail since September. He called in all 10 DC circuit judges to weigh in on this and one of them recuse themselves. And guess which one it was yep one of his former nominees and former legal advisor. This is the money Trail and the money Trail never fucking lies. This is huge.

There is no need for a multi billion dollar border wall. There is no need to force the separation of all families at the border.  There is no need to deny unfortunate refugees the opportunity to apply for asylum.  Illegal border crossings are at a 46 year low.  The situation at our southern border is not as dire as Trump's hysterical tweets suggest. Illegal immigration is not an existential crisis. We are in no danger of losing our country.   The Trump Administration has intentionally adopted a policy of cruelty towards immigrants, and they rationalize their policies by relying on unsubstantiated claims that they pose a threat.  Day after day Trump and his allies resort to fearmongering, scapegoating, and demonizing.  Folks at the southern border have been maligned as rapists, murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and criminals who have been infiltrated by terrorists, and are threatening to spread infectious diseases, while they steal jobs from hard working Americans and simultaneously sponge off the social welfare system because they are so lazy.    Scant evidence has been offered to back these claims up, but when your goal is simply to dehumanize people you can't let hard data get in the way.     Early estimates had put the cost of Trump's wet dream border wall at $25 billion, and that's before any unforeseen cost overruns.    The whole thing strikes me as a terrible waste of resources that is sure to excite reactionaries, but does nothing to solve the underlying issues that compel people to immigrate to the US via any available means.    If the US spends billions on a wall, what have we got when it's done?  Just a wall.  That's it.    It won't improve conditions in the regions in the world where people are suffering.  It won't stop the people living in those regions from attempting to enter the US.  It won't reverse the demographic changes underway in America that have so many entitled Caucasians decrying how minorities are destroying the fabric of society.  Why should we persecute people for losing the birthplace lottery?   Why should anything as universal as wanting better opportunities for yourself and your family be considered criminal?  Instead of building walls to divide us, I would prefer inviting those less fortunate to share in the promise America can offer.
Border security is of the utmost importance to our nation. What many people don't understand is that legal immigration is one thing ,but illegal immigration is quite another. We need security on our southern border ,and we need it now! Our President, is trying to protect and defend our country from foreign invaders and should be applauded not admonished for it.
Children are our future. And children go to school and are being educated by teachers. How can a country progress, when teachers need second and third jobs to make their living ??? The average teacher in the US earns not even half of that a teacher earns in Europe !! Trump gives a shitt about education, because the dumber the people, the more voters he gets. Think about it...while the rich earn more and more and more............

15 of the 19 terrorist responsible for 9/11 were SAUDIS !!! Just a theorie......Saudis planned the destruction of the twin towers, so the US had a reason to ask them for help to fight against Taliban and Al Queda....for that they needed a lot of weapons from the US. Good deal for both ....thinking ...
Build the wall!! Then Lock her up or vice versa
These are not just Demirats your dealing with. They are Anti-American monsters that are dead set on destroying America! Let's END THEM!
Unless YOU'RE DUMB, DEAF AND BLIND, WE ALL know damn well the last TWO YEARS REPUBLICANS and Trump held ALL the power! WHY didn't they get this done? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FUND A DAMN SLOGAN! The Republicans knew it, Trump knew it, and even his campaign knew it was just a slogan "to keep the attention of The Stupid Party". Donald Trumps OWN WORDS! What an abuse of power and a waste of money to all the networks. But hey...it's not Trumps $ so who gives a damn...right?
Yes...Let me be clear...I'm all for securing our border...Technology can do it cheaper, more efficiently and with less environmental impact. Spend my tax dollars on technology!

It is as simple as this if we only enhance border security by putting additional troops at the border our troops will get criticism for shooting the drug dealers that are coming across illegally. What other option would they have since they are not coming in one by one but in droves. A wall will keep them out and ultimately safer than enhanced border security.Mexico has already offered them asylum and many took it but many did not. They have killed many of our border agents by throwing rocks and our president has issued the okay for our agents to defend themselves so be careful what you wish for. This is an invasion orchestrated by our very own Democrats in our govt. Our president is not going to blink, the stakes are too high.
Lier lier pants on fire!!! Americans with common sense do not want to blow 5plus billion on a wall. Trump is looking to line his pockets and the pockets of his pals. That‚Äôs the only reason why he wants a wall. You said Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Make them pay for the wall like you promised and open our government back up. America is not one if your crappy or failed hotels.
How long Is a stupid political class going to allow illegals to come in and drain our treasury and kill our people?????  This is being done to America on purpose folks!!!!!  BY THE STUPID RATS!!! PRESIDENT TRUMP I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT ANY LONGER! Mr.President Trump call "State Of Emergency" and "Build That Wall" now and lock all of these commies up.
BUILD THE WALL ,tell the democrats to go to hell
Stupid dems living behind walls daily.... lol
Yes but not a fucking wall that Americans are being told they have to pay for! What happened to the Mexicans who you said were going to pay for it? Friggn loser!
THIS AMERICAN wants the damn government back to work, and then you idiots can play your damn games. You're putting the whole country at risk with the TRUMPSHUTDOWN!  Meanwhile more terrorists have come in from Canada, but I don't hear you talking about building a NORTHERN WALL!!
BUILD THAT WALL no matter how you get it. Tax the hell out of all those places they send money to mexico and it will be paid for. also NO NEW illegals on welfare/food stamps or free healthcare.that alone will save money on the wall.
FB is censoring this:  Build the wall.  If it can stop 1 rape tree, stop 1 child from getting raped or trafficked, stop 1 murder, stop 1 terrorist from entering and spreading extremism like a disease, or stop 1 load of heroin from entering our county and destroying 1 life, etc. It's worth the price of the wall.  YOU CAN'T PUT PRICE TAGS ON PEOPLES LIVES CITIZEN OR NOT!
Donald Trump is the most inept, corrupt and unscrupulous embarrassment the US has seen.  History will judge him as a traitor.
Look, you lying narcissistic moron. Enough of your lies, Mr Dennison. Tread Carefully tonight.
We need the wall and we need politicians who do not support their OWN COUNTRIES CITIZENS but instead support illegal immigrants and foreign countries  before America to be relieved of their jobs!!
If it were just hard working people who want to be American citizens coming across that would be great. We don't let everyone come in our country by plane so why let drugs and gangs walk across the border. Build the wall to save our children from drugs!!!

Build the damn wall!  I am sick and tired of my taxes supporting other countries and illegals .
Maybe all this wall obsessing makes Trump tired. He certainly seemed low-energy during his Oval Office address. ‚ÄúHe makes Jeb Bush look like a combination of Mighty Mouse and Bruce Springsteen,‚Äù a friend of mine said after the president finished his nine-minute speech to the American people.  For every viewer whose response to the talk was ‚ÄúWow, we should do something about immigration!‚Äù there must have been a hundred whose first reaction was ‚ÄúWhy does this man keep sniffing?‚Äù Deviated septum? Nasal polyps? Trump‚Äôs breathing has actually sounded strange for a long time, but most of us have chosen to ignore it rather than engage in a national conversation about the president‚Äôs nose.  If you watched the address ‚Äî and really, you could have, it was only about as long as it takes to microwave popcorn ‚Äî you saw a 72-year-old guy squinting at the teleprompter and making rather alarming breathing sounds while reading a speech about how we need a wall to protect women who are ‚Äúsexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.‚Äù  This is not a man who should wrap his arguments around the idea of protecting women from sexual assault. But also, gee, he sounded like Uncle Fred who you haven‚Äôt seen for a while and suddenly he shows up for Thanksgiving with weird colored hair and vacant eyes and he‚Äôs talking into his mashed potatoes.

TRUMP you had two years of complete control and your GOP didn't get it done on the wall. Its your shutdown your fault get Mexico to pay for the stupid wall.
Sorry Mr President, but that is a stupid question!  Stopping you is much more important to democrats. They don‚Äôt care about the people who will die, every day, at the hands of illegal aliens, or the drugs and disease they bring with them. They have completely abandoned the protection of American citizens and their rights. It‚Äôs called TDS!
I want border security but a stupid wall is a really dumb waste of money.
Build the Wall  No Amnesty  Don't let the swamp tangle you up in court on the state of emergency.

Don't listen to all the bots they have manifested on Twitter and the hatters that would reject the cure for cancer if it came from you!
They are not interested in one thing or the other, they are concerned about their own skin. In other words, they will try to get you in the pan in every possible way. Even with the worst tricks and feints. Be assured. The snot lives and keeps trying to kill you. Flatten them before they do.
so many brain washed trump spporters who    believe his lies instead of facts just dont the kool-aid
how the hell did they  come in   for 9 11 it wasnt crossing the borders cubans came in by boats they come in by tunnels semis crossing canada borders  get the fricken truth meth is made in usa murders and rapist are here and the biggest con are the presdient his family and goons he is a  fricken traitor to our country
Diane Glauber Gee, that hurt...what ever point you were trying to make.  You haven‚Äôt the faintest idea what I do. Btw, don‚Äôt care.
Kim Miller great talk! You really made a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù there.
Walt Stapf bitch.
Walt Stapf you‚Äôre off base. Again.
Sure are a bunch of whiny bitches here. Guess what, the democrats wanted border security too...until Trump wanted it. You democrats are a special kind of stupid.
The two obstructionists Pelosi and Schumer represent the two largest Sanctuary States in the Country. Where do you think illegals flock to the minute they sneak in? How the hell can anybody in their right mind vote for these two criminals. Elections are definitely corrupt and fixed. Especially in those two States.
All I can say is I hope there is no Thunderstorm and Lightening tonight while Trump is standing there telling all those lies...he will get struck down and burned to a Crisp!! Lies will always come back to haunt you!
Unless Mexico is paying for the wall you're  not fulfilling anything so stop patting yourself on the back.  You are a big fat liar.
i want border security  b  cus of isis  taking advantage of the fact the border is wide open  and the politicians are STUPID
Just build it.  Democrats have been getting away with literal murder to just flat out ignoring laws such as who can and can't vote, gun rights, free speech, and everything else.  Just make everything an executive order.  Fucken fire everybody.  Completely restore the 1st and 2nd amendment.  If there are riots, shoot them they're fucken traitors anyway.

They know Mr President. They know we want border security. A wall, technology, more boots on the ground.... all of it! We know that they don‚Äôt care what the American people want. It isn‚Äôt about us at all. It‚Äôs about them. Their special interests, their foreign aid, their gun confiscation, their tax hikes... the lists goes on and on. Don‚Äôt budge Mr President. We all know who owns this shut down. Let them shoot themselves in the foot. They‚Äôre comical.
It's all about "your Promise"  We know You demented Adderall snorting lunatic.
Keep it shut down-citizens ahead of ILLEGAL immigrants.
Being responsible stewards of the budget, you fucking moron.
Here‚Äôs the thing say he does declare a national emergency and uses the money set back people will still bitch. They‚Äôll say it‚Äôs not an emergency. Say it gets the government open again. People will still bitch. The money is there to be used. This is a win-win. We get the wall and dems dont have to contribute. But I garauntee they‚Äôll try to stop him from using the money and people will still side with them.
Pelosi had spoken for 8 hours about Daca. If these people are so important to her she should be willing to make a deal for them-right thing to do. Now is the time. Everyone knows our immigration system needs to be fixed so we don't have more Daca people. A wall will help secure border, reducing drugs and gangs flowing into this country. Liberals helped organize this caravan, now claim it's not so bad?  We don't want to care for anymore illegals when we have too many citizens that need help.
When Trump says the southern border situation is a national emergency, what he really has in mind is a Trump emergency. He's the boy who cried wolf. He would send our war fighters to the border to start building a wall so Ann Coulter will be nice to him again.  "The basic factory setting on the perception of Trump is: gigantic douchebag. This is a man who manufactured fake Time magazine covers featuring himself with the headline, "Donald Trump: The 'Apprentice' is a television smash!" so that he could put framed copies of it on the walls of his clubs.  His business is convincing people with lowbrow taste to give him their money." http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2018-12-19.html
Your promise was for Mexico to pay for it.  I think that's what the big stink is about.
There is no border emergency you liar.

Unique among presidents, Trump has divided loyalties. He has entangled his business interests with his official duties, creating the impression, if not the reality, that his own financial interest ‚Äî not his duty as president ‚Äî guides his thoughts and actions.  The Founding Fathers, savvy students of history and human nature, were highly attuned to the risks of public corruption ‚Äî actual or perceived ‚Äî and inserted language into the Articles of Confederation and later into the Constitution to guard against such human frailties. They wanted to make sure that anyone who held a public office would serve only one master: the American people.  A farewell to kings For the Founders, public corruption wasn‚Äôt just a theoretical danger. They viewed it as the primary threat to their independence. Living in a small, fledgling country, the Americans feared that the European powers would seize control of the American democracy by flattering and bribing our officials.  The kings and princes of Europe were masters of the art. The British king had corrupted Parliament by providing titles and sinecures, a major contributor to the split between the colonies and Britain. The true history of the 1670 Treaty of Dover had just been published, which revealed that King Louis XIV of France had bribed Charles II of England with a secret pension, a beautiful and beloved French mistress, and a promise of protection. In exchange, Charles had agreed to convert to Catholicism and to join Louis in his costly and fruitless war against the Dutch, his former ally.             https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-founding-fathers-would-have-impeached-trump-in-a-new-york-minute-2018-08-10
Just saw the President‚Äôs address and the Demon-rats response.  I stand by Trump 100%.  I would like to know was there a puppeteer with his hand stuck up Pelosi‚Äôs butt to make her look animated?  Where her eyes scotch-taped open?  Are all Democrats morons? Remember it wasn‚Äôt so long ago that they wanted the wall and all of a sudden it‚Äôs ‚Äúimmoral?‚Äù No one talks about all the  huge corporations who want illegals in this country because they are cheap labor.  Did anyone notice that Pelosi and Schumer never mentioned anything about the American workers and backbone of this country being descimated. Nor did they talk about all the drugs, crime and killings by illegals or the overwhelming burden on our healthcare system Just to name a few issues.  I
Build the wall and electrify it.  If they took care of business in the 1980‚Äôs we wouldn‚Äôt have 20 million illegal alien moochers that pay no federal and state income taxes and their employers dodge some taxes too.
Even your own party does NOT WANT your stupid wall! This is why the Senate passed a CR last year with 100% voting yes! This is also why they never passed it the past two years when the gop corporation controlled all three branches of the government.  End your tantrum now.
They don‚Äôt care about Americans, they care about power! Y‚Äôall need to impeach the judge who gave the 21 day release judgement. Just saying that is just stupid!  Our courts are overrun and they just want to keep letting people in! This is not immigration it an invasion that has been ignored for to long! Thanks for my rant! üá∫üá∏

Demorats just cannot get over that Hillary lost, and will do anything to gain power and stop the president from protecting the US from invasion by illegals.  They even stooped so low as to send bombs to themselves to gain sympathy.
Anyone else find it concerning the President is pushing an opinion piece here?
Don‚Äôt forget a wall on Canada... proven place of entrance and then plop a roof on everything...
Democrat lawyers have been trying to trash the Constitution by misinterpreting the 14th Amendment to expand citizen rights to illegal aliens.  It a subversive lie.    Here‚Äôs what the Supreme Court actually said about ‚Äòbirthright‚Äô citizenship by Daniel Horowitz ‚Ä¢ October 31, 2018     Rep. James F. Wilson, R-Iowa, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee back in the 1860s who helped draft the 14th Amendment, spoke emphatically that it was ‚Äúestablishing no new right, declaring no new principle.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is not the object of this bill to establish new rights, but to protect and enforce those which belong to every citizen,‚Äù declared Wilson in 1866.  There‚Äôs no more authoritative exposition of the 14th Amendment than the first court case after its ratification, the 1872 Slaughterhouse cases. Justice Samuel Miller confirmed that ‚Äúits main purpose was to establish the citizenship of the negro‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe phrase, ‚Äòsubject to its jurisdiction‚Äô was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States‚Äù (emphasis added).  Writing for the court in Elk v. Wilkins (1884), Justice Horace Gray asserted that the phrase ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction‚Äù is ‚Äúnot merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely subject to their political jurisdiction and owing them direct and immediate allegiance‚Äù (emphasis added).  https://www.conservativereview.com/news/heres-what-the-supreme-court-actually-said-about-birthright-citizenship/

Not only do we want border walls and security, it is a must. we should not have to build walls to keep Illegals and drugs but we do, it's a shame that they want to continue to break our laws, build that wall and keep them out, we stand with President Donald Trump 100%
You dont see Nancy and Chuck taking down the wall around their mansions and letting the illegals camp out with them. US needs a wall, for safety, Nancy and Chuck have one, why not the citizens of America. Nancy and Chuck keep their wall, ridiculous.

This is all political and obstruction by the Democrats and we all know it. They will do anything to stop Trump and destroy our country. Just look at what they are celebrating in Congress now. Anti Semitic Muslims swearing in on Korans and defiling the halls of Congress.

This shouldn't even be questioned or debated. Our country should be secured and protected. Our homes and families should be safe from intrusions. But nooo, all the democrats want to do is whine like children.

I'm really DONE with these people and their trolling theatrics! I don't care about the damn corrupt politics anymore... just BUILD THE DAMN WALL, Already! Screw these MORONS who are arguing about it and let them go cry-baby in a snowflake corner, somewhere.

And all of you want the wall built- how? Taking away land from U.S. citizens that the wall would have to cross? Interfering with migrating animals? We have more problems with people coming in on airplanes than we do with southern border crossings.

Melody Hutchison. Wont need to worry about your health problems if a illegal blows your ass up best be worried about that.
Melody Hutchison Really and what type of Pres do you think Obama was. Trump hasn't cut off benefits for those who need it. Medicare and Medicaid both received Raises and so did SS and SSI.
Why is it oue responsibility to pay you for your medical problems, cant work my back hurts,cant work hurt my neck, cant work my knees hurt, look people it is not the governments duty to provide medical and money to its citizens, it's your job as a citizen to get a job with insurance benefits
He's not ever going to change.  I'm not ever going to forgive his cowardice cutting off benefits for the people who really need it. I'm a 49 year old who has had back surgery and I'm going to have to have neck surgery soon. I can't ever hold a job cause I can't sit down or walk very much.  He's the worst president ever including all the republicans.

The real and only acceptable number for the amount of criminals / terrorist to cross the southern boarder and enter into our nation is "ZERO".   That right "0".   So whether it is 4000, 400, 40, 4 or 1 terrorist that illegally cross the southern boarder,  it is unacceptable.   If a southern boarder wall is required to get that number to "0" then so be it.  Hope you are not really mad at this sentence?   The many citizens who could possibly be hurt by this criminal(s) if permitted to freely cross the boarder will be extremely happy that they are safer!

Justin Dewey 74% of the voters want the wall.
Micheal Marceaux that's why I used the qualifier "most". I do realize there are some unfortunate souls out there in denial about the fact that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants entered the country legally, and then didn't leave when they were supposed to. I do realize there are some unfortunate folks so simple-minded they can't imagine ways to circumvent the 'security' of a wall. Don't worry Michael, I didn't forget about you, I said "most". ;-)
Who died and made you the expert? Just cause they spoon feeding you that bs .
All about the framing POTUS! Poll Americans and ask "Do you want a secure border?" Obviously the response will be overwhelmingly "Yes". Poll Americans and ask "Do you support the idea to build a border wall?" The response is going to be overwhelmingly "No", because most Americans know that's a stupid and inefficient strategy for securing our borders...
Anyone opposing a legal and controlled immigration is out for more voters. There is absolutely no other explanation! America is a country of immigrants? Yes. Either immigrants had to bring assets, have a job waiting, have a sponsor, or a needed profession. Other family members often came over years later, when dad had worked and built a nest for the family. On top there was no welfare system before 1935. I can only say San Antonio can not bear any more welfare recipients. Schools districts are going broke, crime is through the roof and homeless people everywhere. Take care of your own first, before saving the rest of the world!

Why don't you and other millionaires buy the wasteland properties along this border and do as you wish with your private property... A wall doesn't have to be on an exact line of property.  They built gas pipelines for miles and miles through citizens property.  You're telling me property can't be bought that runs close to the border in a zigzag line that has a private wall built on it's property???
Your an ignorant man, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you build a wall.  It will not stop American Born serial killers, drug dealers/users, rapist, murderers, bigots, child molesters, etc., etc., from being in this country.  As long as the demands stay in the USA the supply will keep coming
I'm really disappointed with our government in not wanting to protect our nation in choosing to not build the wall just because it is a "Trump thing" and they oppose all Trump decisions, good or not. Why would our government not want to make sure we are protected from foreign invaders, terrorist, drug cartels,  human traffickers, gun smuggling,  kidnapping, and from those who want to disobey the law? Why? Our government  needs to grow up and do what's right for America, instead of throwing tantrums because they didn't get their way in the elections. This is just my opinion. Others are free to feel differently, of course. ;) I am all for immigrants coming here for asylum, byw, but just doing it the legal and safe way. :) I agree with Pres. Trump, that we do need the wall.

If you have children and grandchildren, wake up so they can enjoy the freedom and self-determination we take for granted. If you don't it will disappear forever.

Donald just borrowed the word WALL from those democrats. Nancy will lie on who owns the shut down. Trump accepted responsibility and then immediately Schumer went to microphones and took that responsibility from Trump by announcing shut down "YOU GOT IT" shut down and then enforced shut down by ordering all his democrats to vote "NO" on keeping government open. AND SO IT IS the  Schumer SHUT DOWN the nancy pack of lies

No one is asking for open borders, and that includes democrats. Without a wall, you need drones, cameras and security personnel. With a wall, you still need drones, cameras and security personnel, plus the cost of the wall and maintenance for the wall. You're just adding cost to what you're already doing. And having a wall is not the same as locking your doors to your house. What it's equivalent to is having a fence to your house...which can still be climbed, and we still need security systems and police officers. Trump and his pathetically sensitive ego sees the wall as an afrodesiac for himself and his simple minded  supporters, when in reality it is a total waste of taxpayer dollars that could be better spent elsewhere.

So funny watching the Dems have tizzy fits that Trump is speaking to the People. They even came out and spoke of their fear that people might actually believe the President instead of them.  Panic runs amuck.  Heh.  I would like to see McConnell bring the existing bill to the floor for a vote and go around Pelosi since it has already passed the house. I would love that one passing and leaving her to pout over her loss....Do we have enough votes with the newbies in the Senate?
Democrats hate the USA and are trying to ruin it.  You are completely right.  Democrats are stupid and suicidal.

California and New York democrat leaders are offering free healthcare for all illegal aliens no longer at hospital emergency rooms brcsuse it is a financial strain and physicslly impossible but now thru private doctors. Who the hell are private doctors going to bill? With an americsn citizen they bill their insurance company but who gets the bill with free illegal alien care? The American medical system will become like Cuba or Venezuela - doctors will quit or retire early. Medical facilities will close.

Friends, Conservatives and countrymen: It's time to wise up and stop engaging with trolls, haters and bots. I know it's an a great temptation to want to respond, but it serves no purpose, other than to anger and frustrate you. You're not going to educate them or change their minds, no matter how many facts and how much truth you throw at them. They are baiting you and laughing about it. They want to engage you in "non-issues".  We all have better things to do than to spend our time engaging with Liberal lunatics. Feeding the trolls only serves to keep their comments rising to the top of all of these feeds. Resist the temptation. Stop engaging with them. It simply serves no purpose.

Denise Walker  Democrats won California and New York because of illegal voting.

BUILD A WALL FROM WHAT ????? America's debt is the largest sovereign debt in the world for a single country. The debt is greater than what America produces in a whole year. This high debt-to-gross domestic product ratio tells investors that the country will for the first time have problems repaying the loans. That's a new and worrying occurrence for the United States.

The Democrats don't give a rats about the American people, what we need or what we want. They DO however care more about illegal immigrants. They will stop at nothing to stonewall OUR President even if it cost thousands of Americans there lives
When will the North wall be built? Keep those dirty Canadians out too!
in our state of me. they voted in a severe liberalist who is going to break our back.   democrat,of course. stand your ground mr president
Being Democrat is a mental illness and we all saw the evidence tonight. DRAIN THE SWAMP AND PUT TERM LIMITS on the Senators and the House members.
Someone kill this fool trump already. Honestly learn your own fucking history. Ms13 was founded on the streets of L.A when honest migrants fleeing civil war are thrown in with Waring African American gangs. So what was America's solutions you sent them back to  El Salvador. A combination of extreme poverty and the effect's of a long and brutal civil war allowed this group to explode out of control.   Thankfully my parents chose Australia. But your problems have been around for a long time and it's not just Hispanic Americans that are the problem. African Americans have suffered time and time again nothing has gotten better, then we can jump to the real problem in America GUN'S! how many high school shootings have there been now fucking wake up to your self Mr president Karman is coming to bite you in the ass. It might not have been you that made all the problems but you haven't helped them either
As usual the Democrats /Liberals are stupid.
Another thought:  When and if the Democrats ever get full power, one government run national healthcare system, like Canada, is their biggest goal - listen, actually listen to these socialists.   We will be so busy trying to get a simple cancer test or doctors appointment- we Americans might just need to climb that wall and cross into Mexico just to see a doctor!!  üò±
maybe if you didn't rip off all us hard working americans with your corporate tax cuts the Dems would have let you spend 5 billion on a wall, how many billions of dollars did you rip off from the goverment with your tax cuts? if you are so fucking rich build the wall yourself!
The Dem's Credo... Create Jobs by creating criminals, encourage lawlessness and disorder in our society. Think of all the jobs that thrive off of this negative part of society. Figures, lawyers are one of the biggest profiteers, with prisons, law enforcement, criminal justice and reform, healthcare, welfare, all the non-profits that support this system to grow... and the companies that are needed to support them. When a groups whole outlook on life is, let's just mess things up so we can profit by it, is messed up thinking. To say it politely. A lot of Republicans think this same way. Drain The Swamp!
You should shut down the Democrats paycheck they will change there minds

Build it!! I don‚Äôt understand why people think the President is ‚Äúmean‚Äù or ‚Äúuncaring‚Äù if a wall is built.  He is actually being ‚Äúnice‚Äù and ‚Äúcaring‚Äù by keeping us SAFE!  We are America, they are Mexico.  Two different countries.   Sad that it‚Äôs all about democrats and republicans.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what the topic is- it‚Äôs always a disagreement.  Can‚Äôt we all just agree that we‚Äôd like to be safe?  That they can come on over legally, through the right process?  Doesn‚Äôt seem that difficult to me.....

The wall is be needed, if we keep letting all the illegals in why have laws to make people come in legally. Why have laws at all!  Our safety should always come first. Thanks for standing up for us.  Keep fighting! We Stand behind you!  Put America First!
The new trade deal with Mexico does pay for it. Not to mention they could allocate the funds ceased from drug cartels to get it started. Then the money from the 134 billion we pay out every year to deal with the illegal immigrants once they get in could be used because the wall will dramatically drop the number getting in.
Build the wall Mr. President..  And to Nancy Pelosi's and your party, You people are looking at papers not reality.. Our President is looking out for us Legal citizens that live in the USA.. Not for the criminals,,, like you.. There is something going on with you Liberal democrats,,  Do you think if you bring in more illegals than allow them to vote you'll be control??  Is that all that matters to you??  You and your own money?? well why don't you pay some of these people that are not getting paid right now.. How much is our government paying illegals,, while we go without.. One illegal on a rampage is to many.. Our people come first.. And You Nancy and your cohorts is what is draining our system and putting the American people in danger..  Or are you just like crooked Hillary if 2 or 3 or 4 people die from illegals and say,, (So What)  !!!  How many people do we know are in these sanctuary cities..  If it is so damn safe here out in the open for us who are legal americans,,  why do the illegals get to go run and hide???  Why is that??  In my own Country..  I feel like I don't get a say.. but illegals do!!  People fleeing from other countries, we take them in,, they get housing, money, food,, vehicles, Dr.s, schools, colleges,  and what does it cost them?? And NO they shouldn't get medicare, for god sake,, I paid in and get 11,000 a year on my own SSDI and you people think I should share it, like I never worked my ass off for it..  I would like to know what you people are illegally so caught up in that you would let the american people be murdered or hurt, or raped, or trafficked by illegals, illegal gangs, drug smugglers,, and your Hate for our President who more than half America loves,,, to keep your control,  or whatever you are doing,, hidden from the truth.. And No most drugs are not coming thru the gates  more reading material have you!!!.. Have you talked to Vice?  Have you talked to the men and women who work those lines?  Have you been on any of the stake outs Nancy?  You don't think the children are a threat ??  they are raised to steal and rob. and knife someone,, and it may be to just survive for them but if you think for one minute any of them come over here and are totally rehabbed as soon as they cross that border you are sadly mistaken and Very Naive, so that's why I think all that matters to your party is control and money..  Not the american people...  And all nationalities come thru there from countries everywhere..  Their not stupid, they know how to do it..  and how many of our kids get picked up from here in our country and are taken back across the border, never to be seen again.. They are coming and going out too with illegal money,, with our children for god sake.. I don't care if the President said Mexico would pay for it... Actually if the government stopped paying illegals here in america for a damn week, we would have the money.. You and your party need to own this for people not getting paid as much as anyone..  all your party ever does is play the blame game and point fingers.. god forbid someone doesn't agree with your party or the Liberals.. Economically India is getting ahead of us, as is other countries,, but lets just keep letting them come and let them live better than we americans do while they are all out there protesting our government yet running away from their own..  Guilt is not Inherited..  Whatever this country did or didn't do 100 years ago and further is NOT todays problem.. why do they come here if they don't like it,, when they just left a hell hole..  Because they can that's why !! And they get rewarded for it instead of just being happy they got out of the hell they just left..  It is not up to us to take care of the world, nor should we.. Don't Guilt me. Don't manipulate me Nancy Pelosi  This is NOT about the american people to you, it's about your money.. None of you so called hard working people have a clue,,  You pay into nothing but your stocks.. But you want to keep taxing us to help illegals to help more , help more, help more.. and to help you..  when are you Democrats and Liberals going to start helping the american people that are already here..  what about our own homeless??  they just keep getting stepped on and pushed out of the way.. You Lie to the american People,,  you are NOT helping the President and haven't since day one.. Help us Nancy,, Help the United states of america and our President keep us safe...  You owe the American people Nancy Pelosi,,  We have done enough.. And the President knows that..   God Bless President Trump and his family..  Oh yay,,  Didn't Obama shut down the government too??  and others..  But it didn't affect you or your cohorts did it??  We seen you were all on vacations,, and making plans for your next dirty move.

You are "spot on"!  Donald J. Trump the President Donald J.

Those illegals will not be taken care of with our taxes. Not my address.This country is made up of immigrants who come through the proper channels, vetted first and welcomed the legal way. Stay firm with your stance to keeping America First and MAGA!

Nicole Jarrett  ... They will all get their back pay in full as soon as the Wall is funded. Even if they didn't work a day during the shut down. Neither will they be charged vacation or sick days. It always happens this way. Shut up and take the win. Funny ... did you complain when obama and Clinton shut it down for 16 and 21 days respectively? ... ** crickets ** ... thought so.

A lot of people are complaining because President Trump 'said Mexico will pay for the wall'.  There's more than one way to "pay".  Get that wall built & Mexico Will Pay by having to keep all those druggies, disease-ridden, lazy morons trying to get into the U.S. to leech off the taxpayers here.

Exactly
There is No Emergency!! Trump‚Äôs Border Wall is Another Trump Scam! The Wall will not prevent people from tunneling under it or going around it. To pay for it, Trump will eliminate Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid!! Only the Brain Dead believe the Lies that this Scumbag is Spewing!!

What about all the middle eastern illegals pouring across the Canadian border? This is more of a problem than those coming in across Mexico‚Äôs border!!!!
Simple solution to building the wall. Allow all illegals in, provide them with a ‚ÄúWelcome aboard package‚Äù which includes the immediate right to vote along with  affordable housing but they must agree in writing to register as Republicans/Conservatives then see how quickly Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the Resistance Party coughs up the $5 billion ü§î
Build that Wall declare a state of emergency

It is important to the Democrats who hold office to do everything they can to stop and destroy everything the President tries to do. It is NOT important to them to serve the American people or to protect them. On the contrary. Everything they do is to destroy America. It is obvious by how they vote and what they say. They do not uphold The Constitution. They are traitors to America. Their followers are those who hate President Trump because they don't get their way. He does what is right. They are just evil doers.

Nancy Edgeworth you mean like hiliary and her husband did? Saying things like that only proves how stupid you really are if you believe it.
He can't run from prison!!
I love when he posts stuff. Because then all the dumbocrats come running to say how hes a liar and stupid and blah blah blah. But what they should do is actually look through the comments and look at the likes and see what it really shows. It shows that trump will enjoy another 4 years because they are vastly outnumbered. And the reason they should look at that and accept the reality coming their way is so they can just do the world a favor now and remove themselves from it immediately.

I guess not enough people have died from heroin or from illegals for Schumer and Pelosi. You know President Trump you have a heart and it showed tonight. You love the American people.

Just declare emergency and build the wall...

You're a gaslighting, delusional fool who lacks the capacity to lead. There is a reason Mattis, Kelly, Haley and Tillerson are gone. You don't know how to get along with others.   You fabricated a crisis that doesn't exist. The wall is a joke.   People overstaying their visas is a much bigger problem but since you're a liar and a fraud we don't have a plan to fix it.  Mexico isn't paying but Americans are because you're a dumb tool who has no real accomplishments other than being known as a POS, Cheater and fraud.

WE want a wall it's our family's affected by illegal not your's you all have a wall around your house
We always wanted safer borders. Most Americans didn‚Äôt realize what a wreck the wall was till Obama started letting them pour in to the US. Our Government doesn‚Äôt tell us a lot and I am glad Trump is the first President that cares about Americans and wants to fix this issue that has needed fixed since 1986. Finally have someone wanting to not pass the buck. And for Democrats to cry it‚Äôs immoral is laughable. Any Civilizations have had Walls. Many countries now have same walls or better. Look at Israel‚Äôs and it‚Äôs working look at their statistics.
The last 4 letters in American and republican are I can. The last 4 letters in democrats is rats.
I heard California,and New York said they will pay for all including illegals health care,ü§î On who‚Äôs money taxpayers.....hell no let the wealthy elites pay since they want them here ,like sanctuary cities,celebrities for cheep labor ,and wealthy elites,and business people to pay as little as possible for the cleanup of their mansion and democrats to get their votes to gain power .......STAND UNITED TOGETHER AND WE WILL WIN......

I read this post about the bird feeders and while I totally agree with it I felt it's missing an analogy to support the wall. So let me add the proper anology and explain the need for the wall. (added to end of bird feeder story)  (copied and pasted)-----> I bought a bird feeder. I hung it on my back porch and filled it with seed. What a beauty of a bird feeder it was, as I filled it lovingly with seed. Within a week we had hundreds of birds taking advantage of the continuous flow of free and easily accessible food.  But then the birds started building nests in the boards of the patio, above the table, and next to the barbecue.   Then came the crap. It was everywhere: on the patio tile, the chairs, the table ... everywhere!  Then some of the birds turned mean. They would dive bomb me and try to peck me even though I had fed them out of my own pocket.  And others birds were boisterous and loud. They sat on the feeder and squawked and screamed at all hours of the day and night and demanded that I fill it when it got low on food.  After a while, I couldn't even sit on my own back porch anymore. So I took down the bird feeder and in three days the birds were gone. I cleaned up their mess and took down the many nests they had built all over the patio.  Soon, the back yard was like it used to be ..... quiet, serene.... and no one demanding their rights to a free meal.  Now let's see...... Our government gives out free food, subsidized housing, free medical care and free education, and allows anyone born here to be an automatic citizen.  Then the illegals came by the tens of thousands. Suddenly our taxes went up to pay for free services; small apartments are housing 5 families; you have to wait 6 hours to be seen by an emergency room doctor; Your child's second grade class is behind other schools because over half the class doesn't speak English.  Corn Flakes now come in a bilingual box; I have to 'press one ' to hear my bank talk to me in English, and people waving flags other than ‚Äùours‚Äù are squawking and screaming in the streets, demanding more rights and free liberties.  Just my opinion, but maybe it's time for the government to take down the bird feeder.  If you agree, pass it on; if not, just continue cleaning up the crap!!  (Added analogy)  ......while it appeared all was back to normal I soon realized I had another issue on my hands. With the birds busy coming in droves to my feeders my attention was focused on them and not on the ants that were sneaking in unnoticed seemingly right beneath my feet. Taking advantage of the mess being left behind by the birds. Some of the ants had made permanent homes in and around my porch. While others simply came and went unnoticed taking what they wanted back to there own home.      When I got rid of the feeders everything seemed peaceful. But that was not to be the case. Wasn't long and without the distraction of the birds I began to see the ants. I went to the hardware store and got aunt traps to put up where I could see them coming from. They would fill up almost immediately but the rest of the ants would just re-route themselves and continue coming. They had found other resources to feed on inside my house and soon I had ants in my Crawlspace where I couldn't see them. But they would appear on my counters, in my trash can, in my cupboards. It was out of control. My daughter was petrified, she tiptoed around the house in fear. Me and my wife would try to comfort her and race to her screams. I tried to get them under control but no matter what I tried the ants just came and came.      Then one night my daughter woke us with a scream. It seemed a red ant colony had built a nest in my house as well. I had been annoyed with the other ants, I had even decided that spending a few bucks everyday to try and fight back was better than spending alot more hiring an exterminator. But these red aunt's were vicious. They were very aggressive and very mean. They had attacked my daughter while she was sleeping and had swarmed and bitten her all over her body.      I had had enough...I realized then that something had to be done. This was no longer just a nuisance, it was threatening my family's health and well being. I knew it was time to call an exterminator even if it would cause me to pull from my savings. It was my responsibility to make our home safe for my family.     The next day I called the exterminator. He explained to me he would need to first put up a barrier to stop the ants from coming in. That was the first step of a long process. He would use a special spray that would form a barrier the ants could not cross. He then would search in every dark space in my home to find the ants nests and exterminate them.      He then explained how much it would cost. I sat with my wife and discussed the proposal. We both agreed that it was going to be a burden financially at first. But that in time we would be able to rebuild our nest egg in savings. That in doing this we would save money in the long run by not having to put money out daily to battle the ant problem. We knew we would have to pay a little annually to have the exterminator maintain the barrier but it would be much less than the initial cost and something we could budget in and make doable. Ultimately we agreed that our daughters safety was paramount and chose to pay.     It's been a few years now and every once in a while we do still see an ant here or there. We have no idea where they get in, but when we find them we kill them and we call our exterminator and he imidiately comes to check on the situation and spray where needed.      My daughter runs and plays throughout the house now no longer worrying about about the ants. She sleeps peacefully at night. I wish I had called the exterminator sooner, my daughter should have never had to be hurt for me to come to that decision.
Democrats are only in office because of illegal immigrants voting for them
Build that wall, we need to be protected.

This situation needs to be controlled. Unfortunately previous Presidents & congress did nothing. We do not have an Ellis Island to process large quantities at one time. Our current detention center on southern border cannot handle. We have 12+ million illegals already living here illegally. Majority are on assistance of some type. We have 700,000 waiting for vetting in court system, which is not equipped for that amount either. Fix the systems. Put up the wall until the illegals here are dealt with. When do you stop the runaway train? Before it kills people or after?

I don't understand what the issue with the wall is, it's a win win scenario‚Ä¶ we create construction jobs while it's being built, dissuade illegal immigration and by doing so help raise the wages of normal American people, because ANY supply of people who are willing to work for less than the average American will bring the wages down‚Ä¶ so what if produce has to get a bit more expensive if we don't have to deal with the other negatives that come with illegal immigration: crime, drugs, etc.
I think if you can‚Äôt get the Dems to budge on the wall you should bus all the illegals trying to enter Texas to California on a regular basis.   See how much they can put up with before they start back egging for the Southern border wall. They want them, they can take care of them. Texas wants the wall....
I did not vote for the current President, but I do see the need for building a wall.  Immigrants years ago came through Ellis Island and were ‚Äúchecked out‚Äù both medically and for any criminal record.  Why do people think we should just let anyone into the country and not check them out first.  We have enough crooks in our country as it is (especially in Washington DC).   I am sure drug cartels have paid out millions in bribe money to keep our borders open.
Border security, safety, for the U.S., the citizens is a must.  We have been promised a barrier for 3 decades, promised Comprehensive Immigration Reform only to see it die, ignored, dismantled before our eyes.  The economy can not tolerate the drain, expense of the vast population of illegals.  We do not have enough Border Patrol agents with the necessary tools to adequately to protect our Nation.  In 2017 63% of illegals were on Welfare.
Majority of Americans don't want anymore illegal immigration in United States at this moment we support our President Donald J Trump to build the wall and end illegal immigration in America American people don't want illegal immigrants anymore Democrats are the globalist against American workers

Yes; we do want border security. The Dems who won‚Äôt support Donald Trump are all about hatred. They prove repeatedly they don‚Äôt care about US Citizen safety. They are protected with armed body guards daily,  homes with walls, and videos showing their support of a border wall during past administrations. They are lying hypocrites putting our country in greater risk each and every day. They are so afraid if they agree to fund the wall that Trump will be re-elected in 2020. They are willing to risk our lives with another 9/11 or worse!! We are talking about ‚Äúillegal‚Äù immigrants here; ‚Äúillegal‚Äù being the operative word! If some disastrous incident occurs, it‚Äôs all on you Democrat‚Äôs and your blatant political anger. You‚Äôll never have a Democratic President in the future if you don‚Äôt protect this country, because we won‚Äôt forget who was really responsible for any terrorists acts!!!!
LOL All the Dems got is shutdown! They don't even talk about the American people that were killed, raped, and beaten by illegals. They don't even tell you about the walls around their own home or how they wanted the walls before Trump got in office. Dems need to get out of this country!
Build the wall and put Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on the other side.
Curtis Burke a lot of them actually do belong there.
Build the wall....and then please put the Democrats on the other side of it!

Build the wall or keep the government shut down stop pay for senate and house redirect those wages to pay federal workers.
We want more than that Mr. President, we want the swamp criminals in DC that have been selling our country out all these years to be prosecuted and incarcerated!
Yes we want border security and a wall. The people deserve to be safe and not over run with crime, diseases and people who cant add to America.

As the House of Representatives welcomes its first two Muslim congresswomen, Texas Republicans will vote on Thursday over whether to remove Tarrant County Republican party vice-chair Shahid Shafi from his seat because he identifies as a Muslim-American.  The vote comes after some members of the county party put forth a motion to remove Shafi, a Republican trauma surgeon and Southlake City councilman, from his position due to his Islamic beliefs.  Dorrie O‚ÄôBrien, a precinct chair, expressed fear that Shafi would uphold Islamic law over the U.S. constitution and that he might be related ‚Äúto Islamic terror groups.‚Äù  Bunch of racists
Dear President Trump,  To get the funds to build the wall cut all of the exorbent benefits that the Senate and Congress are given. Let them find their own insurance and pay what we the people have to. We scrimp and pay and can barley survive on what we make.  Let them give up their tax breaks, insurance, take a huge pay cut, this way they can actually see what the American people are dealing with. You sir, are already setting a grand example with taking no wage. We appreciate the fact that you have done this.  There are to many senators and congressmen and women who have made millions off of the American people.  Sir, it has been awhile since we have had a person in the Oval Office who actually loves our Country. The things that they are proposing to do will not help the border Patrol any. We need the wall.  Better yet, make the ones who are protesting the wall live in border towns without their walls and security. Make them live in the neighborhoods who are turned upside down from drugs and gangs. The Congress and Senate live in a fantasy land they need a real dose of reality.  Strip it all away, make them live as we the people live.Let them live with the reality of their idiotic bills and laws they make. Let them walk in the shoes of our law enforcement, soldiers, border patrol agents etc.shoes. Hit them where it hurts, like they do us.   President Trump,  My husband and I stand beside you and what your trying to do.  Keep up the good work.  Cheriee
Bad news for Liberals I found out through my sources that..... Nancy Pelosi is an illegal Immigrant

Americans want pot legilzed not a wall dumbass ... Listen to your people
The Border Wall is a very Important part of the Security, Protection and Safety Of our Country and our Citizens and the Far Left Liberal Democrats were for it when Obama was in office but they are now against it because they Hate Trump!! What a bunch of Hypocrites these People are!!! They are all about themselves and Power hunger and don‚Äôt give a rip about the Security, Protection and Safety Of our Country!! They have made their millions and billions of dollars and some have become wealthy from and in America but they don‚Äôt want to give back and do what‚Äôs Good and Right for America!! We are seeing the true characters and who these Far Left Liberal Democrats are And how they are using America for their profits and catering to Illegals and outsiders!!! Unite and Prepare ourselves for Trump 2020 and Stand Up for Our Country and be Bold to Keep Our Country and our Values!!! Pray for Our President and All the People in His Administration And also for Our Country!!  Lina
I want to puke whenever I see these childish so called democratic leaders screwing up the country I fought for! Now Wisconsin doesn‚Äôt have a governer! That skinny little weasel screwed us all the first day in! We should all have to pass an SAT test before we can vote! Of course that is set up by teachers so forget that idea! Oh boy am I screwed!!
Mr. President, do not falter or sway (not that you would). You have been so good for our country.  This Democratic Party has ulterior motives... to keep our nation divided. There‚Äôs gotta be a way, a law, a loophole to start getting these treasonous people off capital hill and out of our government.  How can people who do not protect US citizens hold any political office?
Liberals are the enemy of the people! Get it done Mr President! Build that Wall!
Liberals are the enemy of the people! Get it done Mr President! Build that Wall!
The Dems have proved what they want, Socialism to take this Country down.  How disgusting for them not to be American enough to want to do what is best for it.  Just like NY Gov and Ca,  govs wanting to give illegals free medical, while we taxpayers foot the bill.  That's not even crazy, it's downright evil.
F Mexico. Don't want those peasants to pay. The American....true Americans will pay.
Time to remove Pelosi and Schumer
Soon u build the dam wall they gonna build damn tunnels to still come thru to the United States
They do not want to w9rk with Trump.  They never wanted a wall or more secure boarder.   SHAME ON OUR SENATE AND CONGRESS
Send all the immigrants to California. It will wake them up
Build the wall for our own safety .No more illegals murdering and raping innocent women and children .

My last words your is the worst president ever United States of America you worse than bush I cannot depend on you no more never did New York City we all know you for the crap but I guess is what it is the worst president ever in the United States in America
Build the wall don't give in to those low life liberal thugs that put every thing and every illegal above America and our citzens. Stick to your base we elected you to drain the swamp.
They'll do anything to obstruct. Build the wall and tear down the Democratic Party. MAGA
@SpeakerPelosi The Democrats are not just calling the president a liar they are calling DHS Liars border agents Liars ice agents Liars American people Liars they won't even listen to these people all of these people should sue their employer fornot making their jobsafe timestrike
I don't know how you do this job for free to take care of a country where so many people bitch and complain!! I would've quit a long time ago and let them get screwed! You are AMAZING!
This is the Chuck Schumer Shutdown, Schumer is like a little spoiled brat! Chuck talks out of both sides of his mouth! Schumer, Obama, and Hillary all have said they want a wall but today if they would give money for a wall, it would be a win for the President! They don‚Äôt want the President to win bottom line! I want the wall!
Wish, we could have you in Europe. You're the best leader entire planet. Drain the swamp in Europe too, please POTUS üòç
They disagree with you Pelosi and her crew.  You are right in what you said.  Let them open their gatesst their homes  or let them go for a jog in New York or California by themselves with no security or even. Mlm their family.  Lets see how many illegals may hurt or kill them.  I as an Anerican born and raised here want a wall.  Put all our tax dollars to use in our country not given out freely to other countries.   Stay strong please.   Don't give in please.  I want my grandkids to live in a better America. And you are the one to do it.
And the United States needs a wall
I thinks it‚Äôs funny how people are bitching about this government shutdown when Obama did the exact same thing for freaking Obamacare.  At least a border would help keep criminals, drugs and illegal immigrants out our country.
President Trump: It‚Äôs time to order the arrest and deportation of undocumented DACA and illegal immigrants simultaneously and immediately in all sanctuary cities. So, Democrats will have no way but to give the border wall funds not only $5.6B but for  $25B in exchange of DACA temporary stay pending the passing of comprehensive immigration law. Americans are waiting for your iron fists and we will be supporting you to exercise your emergency power to utilize existing military defense funds if border walll funding bill failed at the Senate and thereby, strongly execute immediate arrest and deportation undertakings  for the protection, security and safety of the American families and children.
It‚Äôs pretty obvious to anyone who isn‚Äôt a complete idiot that they will do anything to keep you from doing things that you promised to do, because they all know as mostly ‚Äúcareer‚Äù politicians, that you are only supposed to tell people what you think they want to hear, and never actually carry out anything that would actually HELP your consistency. And, you also should talk out both sides of your mouth and change your position on a given issue any time that the wind changes direction! And, like Obamacare, (said Speaker Pelosi) ‚ÄúYou have to pass a bill first in order to see what‚Äôs in it!‚Äù And, like John Kerry, sometimes you can be ‚Äúfor something before you are against it.‚Äù They are all scum-sucking SWAMP CREATURES! Build The Wall!
Can you tell Nancy Pelosi our values are American lives.  Can you tell Schumer American lives are the most Nobel cause and worth every expense. And tell the Democrats to stop lying saying they  want border security The American people are not stupid because their actions do not match their words.
Congress will not listen anyway so we need to start looking into that problem as America is tired of the silly things going on.  Build the dam or wall and let President of the USA finish a job that should have been done 30 years ago.
Build the wall.. And id love to throw Polosi and Chucks ass over it! Democratic Party is a bunch of idiots.
"Illegal Immigrants" are not immigrants, they are invaders. Immigration is a legal process. A stand against the wall, is a stand against the Constitution they took an oath to support and defend:   U.S. Constitution - Article 4 Section 4 - The U.S. Constitution Section 4 - Republican Government. The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.
The Republican Congress came up with a budget in December that passed the Senate 100-0. Trump agreed to it at first, but then backed away because Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, and a few other right-wing media activists told him not to sign it because they didn't like that it did not address his wall - it had prior been suggested that border security and the wall be looked at with separate funding. When Trump backed out, he took responsibility for the shutdown. He even said so publically on television. So to deny that Trump is solely and utterly responsible for this is outright delusional and a perversion of the facts.
Maybe President Trump should just use all of the time on air playing the past Democrats views on the border and illegal immigrants.  Pelosi, Schumer, Obama, Clinton‚Äôs and Biden.  Then their air time would be trying to explain what has changed.
Stay the course, Mr. President!!  Protect our citizens and build the Wall!! The Dems only care about those who want to destroy the people of this great country!!  They have supported and built these walls in the past, so now they choose to politicize!!  We will be on the phone tomorrow to let Congress know that we support the Wall!!

What i didnt understand of what the democrats are saying Pelosi and Schumer is ridiculous. The border needs to be secure. They are giving false facts. What's their answer to the killings by the illegal immigrants???? But Pelosi and Schumer don't care.
Split the country in half.  Democrats on one side Republicans on other.   Bet anything Dems will need our assistance. #changemymind
Build the wall and take pay away from the Dems while the govt is shut down
It's $5 billion out of $40 trillion of one year's budget.  I suggest that if you aren't vigorously fighting other forms of wasteful spending as hard as you are this, you simply are speaking out for one reason. You hate Donald Trump.  So what is the harm if we over protect our border? What if it slows the flow of illegal drugs just enough to save a few lives. I know my family has lost a couple young men to drugs over the last couple years that maybe would still be here if it wasn't so easily accessible.   What if it keeps just a few murderers out of our country. Isn't it worth it? Haven't we wasted money on worse things than this?  Are you so petty that you would oppose this out of spite while not opposing the other billions we waste or the $50 billion a year we just give away to other countries?  It's $5 billion out of $40 trillion of one year's budget.  I bet most of you never fought so hard for such a small percentage of the budget.... until Donald Trump became your president.  Seems pretty obvious to me what your motives are!
When will the liberal voters realize these Democrats are as fake as plastic and could not give two Hoots about anyone but their own egos ...winning politically is all they care about... that means votes getting votes and getting more votes from the dead from the prisoners from the illegals more refugees more refugees more votes... Libs to all illegals: we will give you free housing free money free tax refunds free welfare free healthcare come to us all you who are burdened and we Democrats will do whatever we can to warehouse you in poverty crime and squaller all of you just vote for us ... and guess what the stupid lame & wimp Republicans won't speak up and stop us
Democrats  are also killing ILLINOIS,
Your job is to protect us and keep us safe!  You will have blood on your hands if you don‚Äôt fix this!  You will have to live with the fact for those that die of illegal immigrant acts..to include bad drug running!  I have faith in you sir...pull the plug  on this and do the right thing...screw Congress!  Praying for you!

They all knew Chuck and Nancy did a crappy job on rebuttal, because they kept sending out more and more moronic Democrats to say something, Bernie, that drunk driver Beto from Texas, and the crazy Cortez chick all came forward. Then the professional liars in the corrupt media took over to tell us why Americans don't deserve protection, and why illegals should come ahead of US citizens. I watched none of it, I turned it off after the POTUS spoke but, but my daughter's twitter feed was on fire. Great job Mr President, stay strong, your voters are still with you.
Good Lord, the democrat's are acting so DESPERATE tonight. They're scurrying around like RAT'S in the kitchen, when the lights have been turned on. (lol)  Danger, danger, Trump's going to convince the world we need a wall. We must stop him! We must stop him! (lol)  How pathetic they are.

For two solid years Trump has had the White House and the Republicans have had control of both the Senate and the House.    In the two years that Republicans controlled it all they won a few very hard fought battles.   Democrats fought hard but were unable to stop Trump's Tax reform bill, Supreme Court Justice appointments, and Federal appointments.    Now Trump wants Americans to believe that the reason his wall has not been built is because the Democrats have stopped him.  He couldn't get enough support for his wall from his own party.   Now that the Democrats regained control of the House, Trump is using Federal Workers, Federal Contractors, farmers, the list goes on, and the most vulnerable among us as collateral damage while he throws a temper tantrum and shuts down the government with threats to not reopen it until he gets his way.   Prior to shutting down the government, Trump proudly stated on national TV that he would take the full credit for the shutdown and was proud to do it.   Now suddenly, none of this is his fault.  It's the fault of the Democrats who for two solid years were just trying to keep their heads above water because of the power and control Trump was wielding.   The success of the Democrats in the Mid-Terms are a testament that the American people overall are not happy with Trump's presidency.   One of the corner stones of Trump's campaign was to build the wall.   I'm personally old enough to remember when Mexico was going to pay for it.  :)   Trump is nervous about his bid for re-election.   He feels he has to get this wall up as a matter of his own political survival.   Shutting down the government is a serious issue.   Trump is using the government shutdown like an impetuous child.  He doesn't care who gets hurt.   He spews hate and fear to Americans rather than working with his own party as well as Democrats to come to an agreement on rational border security measures.   His is not the behavior of a rational person and most certainly is not acceptable for someone holding the position of President of the United States.   He is acting more like a terrorist than a president.    Disgusting.
26 days Clinton shut down 16 days Obama in history of government shut downs only 3 times republicans controlled house  stay strong secure border stop all taxpayer funding to ALL illegals in country and get term limits with ban on lifetime benefits
Children in flint no water companies in Florida dumping cancerous toxic waste at our back door killing everything causing salt water fish to be extinct by 2048, cost of living constantly goes up every month trump is in office as it is and going to be worse with this wall. So it makes exactly 0 sense to build it.
Yes Americans want Border Security Democrats want Border Security everyone wants it except you Donald Trump you want a wall. So what's more important your useless wall or putting Federal employees back to work because both Republicans and Democrats have pushed bills with Border Security funding and or Government Funding and you've said no because wall Funding was not written in. You own this shutdown you initiated it and now continuing it.
Of course! I‚Äôm so dang upset over the democrats that I can‚Äôt stand it!!! How in the hell Can President Trump get anything done that will help our country with Pelosi and her puppets in office!! This is the worse of the worst! Why do the democrats get to fire back with lies after OUR President talks! I‚Äôm sure I speak for millions of Americans when I say this has got to stop!!! I have NEVER seen anything like what the media is doing and what the Democrats are doing to our people, our country and our children!! OUR PRESIDENT NEEDS TO YOU ABLE TO DO HIS JOB FOR ALL OF US!!!!

Build the wall.  It wont prevent illegal invaders totally but will significantly reduce their chances to get in.  We have been Promised a wall since Jimmy Carter but it has all been talk and no action.  The majority of Americans support you stay strong.
Yes you bet I am, it's the only thing standing in the way of tyrants and idiots like you that think they have a right to the services and wages of others.

It's us against those that hate America, build the wall and to Hell with the democrats.

And you are holding back vets much needed money over all this unnecessary nonsense! Shame on you! You know a lot of them need meds and counseling and rehabilitation and doctors and to pay for their and their families to have housing! You are heartless, cold blooded and selfish and on a very big ego trip and people are or will suffer. That‚Äôs not good! You‚Äôre not a good person.
The Democrats don‚Äôt give a rats ass about the American people!! They just want to stop President Trump from for filling his word!! unlike that Traitor Obama!! It‚Äôs time we bring Obama to justice!!! Arrest And convict him of treason!!! And if the minorities want to riot in the streets. We got nationalguard to take care of that problem too!!
This idiot in chief is a lying bastard who doesn‚Äôt know what the truth is if it came up to him and introduced its self. He‚Äôs a freakn clueless lying asshole.

SHUTDOWN: O.K.  Again.  Let me try to explain the procedure again:  Let's say that Trump gives up on getting the wall funded. *stick with me*  Does that immediately end the shut down?  For the people who received an indoctrination instead of an education, the answer is NO.  The HOUSE needs to pass the bill *the CR*.  Then it goes to the SENATE for approval.  Once both the House and Senate pass the bill, THEN it goes to Trump.  If Trump signs off on it, the CR becomes law and the shut down is over.  If Trump doesn't sign off on it, the shut down continues. Then and ONLY THEN, it will be a Trump shut down. I know I lost most of the Democrats with this simple but TRUE example, but that's how it works.  NOW:  Explain HOW the shut down happened?  A bill *the CR with wall money* passed the HOUSE and went to the Senate.  The SENATE did NOT pass the bill because they need 60 votes and there aren't 60 Republican Senators.  So the bill *the CR* NEVER made it to Trump to sign or to veto, which means Trump DID NOT cause the shut down and IS NOT responsible for those who are not getting paid.  Trump is trying to find ways to GET THOSE PEOPLE PAID.  I know that I lost the rest of the Democrats who believe, despite the truth, facts and the legislative process, that Trump is responsible for the shut down. If people want to blame anyone for the government shut down, Blame Schumer and his sycophants in the Senate for shutting down the government and starving sick children and single mothers.
ILLEGAL isn't a RACE..ITS CRIMINAL.  The people who claim its inhuman-where are they with American Vets? Homeless citizens? THIS Border Security is about trying to destroy Pres Trump..and to allow more illegals into the US... IRONICALLY the DEms want BACKGROUND CHECKS for US CItizens BUT not for illegals?? Besides increasing disease, crime, human traffiking, drugs AND hundreds of thousands of illegals without skills/education/money or the ability to be independent... and these illegals want to be on the welfare of American taxpayers-----CAN the DEMS give us reason WHY we should have open borders???
"Illegal Immigration is wrong, plain and simple. Until the American people are convinced we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress." -Senator Chuck Schumer, 2009  "We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented and unchecked." -Barack Obama, 2005  "I voted numerous times‚Ä¶ to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in. And I do think you have to control your borders." -Hillary Clinton, 2008
I am certain it's to stop you from fulfilling another promise.  But, hopefully the Dems will grow up and realize that our nations future successes depend on building this wall. The American tax payer can not keep paying for housing and food for all of these illegal people. We already have enough homeless and hungry people to care for.
Donald Trump you will get the wall and a lot more.  And of course, Pelosi and Schumer will take credit for it.  Obama will say he orchestrated it back when he was just a freshman chimp.  But who cares, you're getting the wall.
According to Nancy Pelosi's own speech, "only 2,500 ILLEGALS came across the boarder last week." According to her own speech about a week ago, each illegal "only costs the US Tax payers $70,000 a year." So lets break this down into "factual" numbers according to Ms. Pelosi. Those 2,500 illegals will costs the American Tax Payers $175,000,000.00 (that is 175 MILLION) in the next year. If the 2,500 is an average week then that is 130,000 a year in ILLEGALS. It will cost the American Tax payers over 9.1 BILLION DOLLARS a year to support them! This is only to feed, house, educate and give them health care. If any of them commit a crime and is arrested, then the figure goes up because then US Citizens PAY to DEFEND them! These figures come from the Nancy Pelosi's speeches to convince US Citizens that there is no crisis at the board. REALLY??? Democrats use them to SLAM Trump but neglect to give the full picture! Wake up America and BUILT THE WALL!
go trump go!!  Stop the senators paychecks too! Build that fucking wall!  We the people want it. That's why i voted for you. Stand up to our stupid govt. Hell yes build it and they will come!

It‚Äôs really sickening the way MSM is covering the anticipated speech and saying it‚Äôs not going to be factual and there is no crisis.  Get all your facts out there ‚Äî especially the fact that they are proposing money from our budget and tax dollars to build a wall in Tunisia.  The minuscule percentage of the budget that 5B is and the billions paid out every year in ‚Äúsocial programs‚Äù for ILLEGALS, including the cost of sanctuary cities, prison, opioid epidemic, human trafficking etc.  There better be a comprehensive plan of immigration reform, e-verify, a census with the citizenship question on it, cleaned up voter rolls, a consistent election process in all states, etc.  Do Dems not want it nor see that you were elected because you promised this reform ‚Äî it‚Äôs not a political promise it‚Äôs the job you promised to do.  And it‚Äôs what we voted for.  They offer no solutions, just opposition.  Design the wall based on what the border patrol tells you they want and need ‚Äî not the Dems.
You are correct President Trump.  It is 100% about keeping you from winning in 2020.  The Dem's hate America and are obsessed with power at levels unimagined in our nation's history.  Keep fighting, because we really have nothing left to do.  We love you and we love your beliefs.  We know your heart and we know that you are our last Hope.  If the dems win, the nation is doomed and we will be flooded with cancers disguised in human flesh that will be unbeatable. We will be poisoned till death as a nation.  Please keep fighting.  I am so glad that Lindsay Graham is on your side and he is willing to back the TRUTH. Keep fighting Mr. President we love you!
THERE IS NO CRISIS..YOU ARE A STUPID IDIOT..CONGRESS PLEASE IMPEACH THIS MOTHERFUCKER
Trump should pay for the wall HIMSELF, since he LIED about getting Mexico to pay for it!  Don't steal our taxpayer money because you couldn't deliver on your promise!

Build the wall however you have to do it. The Dems haven't done anything for the last two years . It's my money paying for their BS and I'm tired of it . They sit there on their high horse making jokes , nothing funny about it .

Another Trump lie:  All four living former presidents deny telling Donald Trump that they support his long-promised border wall, contradicting the president‚Äôs false claim that his predecessors ‚Äútold me that we should have‚Äù built the wall.  ‚ÄúThis should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me, and they all know it,‚Äù Trump said during a news conference on Friday. ‚ÄúSome of them have told me that we should have done it.‚Äù  On Monday, former President Jimmy Carter joined the three other living former presidents in confirming that Trump lied about the claim.  ‚ÄúI have not discussed the border wall with President Trump, and do not support him on the issue,‚Äù Carter said in a statement through his presidential center. Spokesmen for former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush told Politico Friday that neither of them had discussed the border wall with Trump. Former President Barack Obama‚Äôs spokesman declined to comment.  Aside from a brief interaction at former President George H.W. Bush‚Äôs funeral last month, Obama has not spoken to Trump since leaving office in 2017, Politico reported.  However, Obama has repeatedly railed against Trump‚Äôs proposal for a border wall.  ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just put walls up all around America. Walls don‚Äôt keep out threats like terrorism or disease ‚Äï and that‚Äôs why we propose leading our alliances and helping other countries develop, and pushing back against tyrants,‚Äù Obama said in a speech in September.  During Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign in 2016, Obama called the wall ‚Äúimpractical‚Äù and quipped: ‚ÄúGood luck with that.‚Äù

There is no way they can understand the process of absolute genius when they are limited by their ‚Äúfeels‚Äù as actual facts.  Remember.. a well fed slave will never want to be freed. Fund the wall by cutting unnecessary handouts. How many jobs could be created if you took those welfare junkies and made them build the wall for their meal ticket...?

It can be accomplished thru other means without hurting so many people in the process. I'm not looking for a fight just stating my opinion, and it's my right!! I guess you weren't taught, "If you can't say something nice maybe you shouldn't say anything at all."

I'm a military wife. I don't oppose the boarder and policing it but we have the East/West coast and the northern boarder as well not to mention the airways. You can't encapsulate the United States!!    Americans want to pay their bills, feed their families, have a roof over their heads. Mr President you are hurting the American people! Why can't you see that?  What's wrong with you? How can you sleep at night? You'll eat, have a roof over your head, and be able to pay your bills! You need to put yourself in the common wealth of America's shoes just maybe you'll have compassion. That remains to be seen.  You started out doing good but you've recently lost sight and are hurting the American people and that is unacceptable, Sir!! Why doesn't the government spend the money that has been confiscated from Chavez (drug lord) and put it to good use. All drug money that's Confiscated period!! That makes good sense to me and we, the Americans don't pay the price!! Please, please, think about it for Gods sake.

Walls work pretty damn well, they served the Romans, the Chinese built one hell of a wall, the wall in Berlin stood longer than it should have, we have been guarding one heck of a wall on the 38th parallel for nearly 70 years, The Sumerians‚Äô Amorite Wall worked great, the Long Walls protected Athens, the  Great Wall of Gorgan known as Alexander the Great‚Äôs Wall, Hadrian‚Äôs Wall and the Theodosian Walls and Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs Manor Wall. Seems walls are a great idea to keep criminals and trash out. Just build some nice gates for green card workers and legal immigrants....

Mr. President Donald Trump.  I'm a Dane living in Berlin. Europa needs a President like you, the best USA President since President Ronald Regan.  We Europeans have the German desaster Angela Merkel.  Look at Europa and see what she have done with the Europeans people.  We are over flooded with Muslims and Africans too, and Islam makes so much krime and chaos over all in Europe.  Killing, terror, rape the European womens, that is what Angela Merkel and her terror army from the muslims and africans have done with Europeans citizens.  We do not have a wall, and Europe need it.   You can build it and protect your citizens from the deasters like what we do have ib Europe.   Mr President Donald Trump.   Build the wall!

And did you see that headline about your campaign manager sharing intel with Russia intel.   We have some collusion....Donny the fraudy.

They won't ever give you a thing.  They don't care about the USA.  They are globalists.  When they said they wanted to secure the border in past years......they LIED.  They only wanted the votes on both sides of the isle.  Lying is a means to an end for these despicable people.  They really just need to be ignored and avoided.

My President is being Obstructed by Democrats from doing the job We The People overwhelmingly elected him to do. He promised us border security and protection, and we want OUR tax dollars used to erect ‚Äústeel slats‚Äù, not brick walls like surrounds the Obama‚Äôs and Pelosi‚Äôs mansions, to name a few. If the Dems continue to obstruct the work of our President, maybe they should be paid by merit/hour? Something We The People should consider discussing to vote on for the next election!
Don‚Äôt give in Mr President!  Keep us shut down till the Dems get on their knees and apologize to the American people for ruining Our Country!  MAGA 2020!!!

These Democrats are unbelievable!! They do not care about your safety!! I can hardly believe this BS they are telling and to belittle the president !! His main campaign was to secure our borders and we voted for him to do what he promised he said he would ... now the Dems want to say that , that is not what the American people want? WHAT?  Are you kidding me .... we would only want Legal immigrants to this country not ones who think they can just push and free load off us and expect us to change our laws.  Do you taxpayers want to pay for these illegals . The healthcare and housing , food etc that we would have to supply to them gives them handout that we Americans don‚Äôt even get!!  You either come her legally or stay out !!   BUILD THE WALL
Americans want security, 70% don't want the wall. Pay attention Cadet Bonespurs. And your "promise' was do the doucebags in your base, not to the majority.
No taxpayers money for the wall liberals?  Fine. We'll GoFundMe it. Oh by the way. No more taxpayer's money for illegal immigrants. No food,shelter, education, or medical help. GoFundMe them yourselves.  Fair deal. Wall is 25 billion one time investment. Illegals cost 125 billion a year. You liberals are stupid. Stop funding illegals with my taxes.

To all of Congress who don't want a barrier ( wall of some kind ) with armed guards.       You should lead by example and remove your walls and armed security you have protecting your loved ones.

Put this Country and it US Citizens  first before you give away our tax earned dollars to other countries.

THE RUMP is the enemy of truth, justice and honesty and the enemy of REAL AMERICANS !!!
If you declare an emergency, when there IS NO EMERGENCY. that is ABUSE OF POWER.  More ammo to get you impeached, so go ahead.
Americans want you behind bars. The end.
The campaign gave you a Wall to talk about because your an aging dotard. So they said train him to talk about the WALL so he remembers to talk about immigration. TRUTH liar does not escape the majority of Americans. The only crisis is you.We must remove you NOW. Let's see the lies you tell to try and declare a national emergency. Your not our dictator, you are abusing the office. You are lying ,no , let me repeat, no terrorist have come across the southern border#mueller time#impeachthetyrant

Trump is now pinning his near-term political future on his promise of a wall that would no longer be a wall, and that neither Mexico nor Congress is willing to pay for. All of this in the service of a campaign promise that never had broad public support in the first place. Trump supporters are a minority in this country, not "we the people".

Stand strong President Trump. America is behind you. Build the wall! The Dems will stop you anyway they can! You should play clips on TV tonight of other times Nancy and Chuck agreed to the wall. If you didn't want the wall, they would. They need to put America first before their own agendas and temper tantrums. Build the wall and shut down the border!

No matter your political standing you must love and protect your country.  Just hating 1 man is not a good answer, grow up.
Actually any of the polls I have seen recently say 56% of Americans DO NOT want the wall.  http://fortune.com/2018/12/12/trump-border-wall-poll/
Boarder security and a wall are two different things! You just want the wall because of your inflated ego...smh
ONLY THING THEY CARE TO DO IS STOP THAT WALL AT ANY COST! ... EVEN IF THE COST IS  THE DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA AS WE KNOW IT... LOOK AT THEIR ACTIONS...
Mexico will paid the wall? Trump need to pay taxes and pay the wall :)
God don't mess with a son of a b****

The sad part about your comment is that it has nothing to do with what is best for the country. All that matters to you is getting your way at all cost. The facts don't support much of what you say. You lied to us about who would pay for the wall. You lied about carrying the mantle for the shutdown. You lied about being proud to shutdown the government, holding it hostage and putting 800,000 people out of work. Working together means give and take on both sides, and not everyone else should give and you just get to take.
Stop calling them Democrats. They are no longer Democrats. They are Communists. Party first. Country last. Communism's core tenant.

#USAinJO     #Whitehouse #FBI #Fox_News #ABC_News #CNN #Donald_J_Tramp #Speaker_ryan  Dear Mr, #JIM_BARNHART #US_Empassy_in_Jordan  Kindly take a look to my case and give me few minutes to explain my problem ..  As we are American company and we pay tax and our ID company is     EIN 35-2517909  DUNS: 004044035  My case is related to what is happening in Jordan with tobacco and cigarettes and it is in summary:  I entered container 40 feet of American cigarettes to Aqaba port and my goods had been stolen and someone put bricks instead of my cigarettes and I face many problems with the custom and till date nobody is helping me to solve it ..  We had talked to the Jordanian government about the problems faced by American companies in Jordan. I have encountered a problem with customs for two years.  1- The goods were sold according to official invoices and received a check in progress according to the custom in Jordan and export. 2 - The goods were cleared and loaded in containers 40 feet under customs supervision and a customs lead was placed. 3- The container was delivered to the customs team's patrol according to the duly written book. 4- The customs circular book was received from the customs office of Aqaba, which is subject to inspection of the lead by the competent examiner at the container port. 5- A description of the customs at the container port has been explained that the goods inside the container smoke are identical to the customs declaration inside the yards of the port. 6 - When reviewing the clearing company of the port of containers to pay the port fee did not find the container on the port system and was informed port for field research. 7 - The representative of the clearance company was informed that the container according to the cameras entered the port at 2:34 pm (note that according to the cameras entered the port the previous day at 11 pm). 8- The customs of the port have been asked to inspect the container on the fact by the commission .. Where bricks were found instead of cigarettes inside the container .. Based on what has been made it is quite clear that the responsibility lies between the Jordanian Customs and the Aqaba Container Terminal beyond any doubt.  Because of all the above I lose my money and I couldn't enroll my children at school or send them to State to study there.   I want a solution because we collapse because of this problem.  On the other hand , I can't pay to the bank mortgage and my house in Jordan at risk from the bank ..  I need from your highness to solve my problem so I can teach my children and pay for bank .  Your quick reply is appreciated.   Thank you for your time ,   Moe AL Hazzam MO Hazzam

We people can see what the democrats are doing.  They are using their personal opinions of the president, to make themselves appear more powerful, and try to damage his future and accomplishments.  It's not about what the democratic people want that should determine what happens to our money, alone. It is about what we the people want.  We  the people voted our president in office, because we see what he is capable of doing. Not to let the democrats stop the president in fulfilling his promises to us, the people. Seems to be some very disrespectful, devious, jealous and rude people in the democratic party towards our president. Democrats who think they are right to ridicule our president, are not right.   It doesn't matter, whether you like the way our president acts, behaves, walks, talks etc.. What matters is to stop holding the president back, from his potential talent. Just because you, are afraid to be hidden behind, and want to be heard, doesn't make your actions correct.  Show respect. Stop hindering our President progress... I have never seen such disrespect, towards any other president in all of my life, as I see with this president. We the people don't want our President to be disrespected.
So put money towards more ICE agents. better vetted and trained, creating jobs in the process.  Put more money into weapons and tools for border agents.  Put more money into tech for better surveillance and tracking.  Enact safer gun laws to protect our citizens from the real threat of Americans who use Ar-15's against our schools and public venues.  Be sensible, factual and actually do some good, instead of lying to the people you're supposed to protect.

BS
Ever have the feeling you've been cheated?  https://www.justsecurity.org/62156/terrorists-southern-border-myth-reality/  Taken at face value, rhetoric from the White House and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would lead Americans to believe that the United States is facing a terrorism crisis at our southern border. The picture being painted is one in which thousands of terrorists have been stopped crossing our southern border to infiltrate the Homeland. If that were true, that would indeed be a crisis.  In reality, no such crisis exists.  Our federal courthouses and prisons are not filled with terrorists we‚Äôve captured at the border. There is no wave of terrorist operatives waiting to cross overland into the United States. It simply isn‚Äôt true. Anyone in authority using this argument to bolster support for building the wall or any other physical barrier along the southern border is most likely guilty of fear mongering and willfully misleading the American people.  Why do I know this? As Director of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) from December 2014 until December 2017, it was my job to lead the government‚Äôs efforts to collect and analyze all available information about terrorist threats to the Homeland. It was my responsibility on behalf of the Intelligence Community to synthesize and present that terrorism picture to our most senior decision makers ‚Äì up to and including the President of the United States ‚Äî so that sound decisions could be made about how to protect the Homeland from terrorist attack.  Here is ground truth on this issue. Terrorist groups like al-Qa‚Äôida and ISIS spend time talking about, brainstorming and even fantasizing about ways in which they can do harm to the United State. At times, those conversations have certainly included discussion of ways in which terrorist operatives might be inserted into the Homeland. But we also knew from intelligence reporting that terrorist groups have very high regard for our Homeland Security capabilities, including our border security. They know we had become a much ‚Äúharder‚Äù target than at the time of 9/11 and that getting their operatives into the United States is an extremely challenging proposition. Cont-

Suck it up
You are playing the stupidest game with semantics.  Replace the term ‚Äúborder security‚Äù with wall and the statement is false.  You need to recognize we all want secure borders, your the dim wit that keeps making it about a wall
If they do the actual fact-checks; Trump has been fighting/stating the same for over 20 years about border security; its not ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù to him‚Ä¶meanwhile Schumer and Pelosi have signed for the wall 16 times already‚Ä¶ Who are the liars here? They need to stop this government shut down by getting to work like they‚Äôre paid to do and negotiate a compromise. Stop putting politics before the people.
They Prefer Sending Money To The Foreign Countries For Obortions,Instead Of Keeping America safe.  Take There Pay And Hold It.

Vicki Oldham  Child, that was campaign rhetoric.  You didn't expect Mexico to wtite a check did you? It appears that with the mess at their border because of the caravans, they are incurring some expense. We also have a new trade agreement with Mexico.
The promise is, ‚ÄúMexico will pay for the wall.‚Äù Keep your damn promise.
How many people have a fence around your property? Why do you have a fence? Do you have locks on your doors? Why?  Take a moment and think about the question.
I believe your promise was that MEXICO WAS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. But you went and stuck your foot in your mouth saying you were toning to make somwone else pay billions for something.  Surprised you don't have athletes foot, in your mouth, for how many times your foot ends up there.  Then again, you are no athlete.

The same year that Trump's FCC Chairman Ajit Pai killed broadband privacy and cheated Network Neutrality to death, the Trump tax plan delivered a $20B windfall to AT&T -- both Trump and Pai claimed that the measures would stimulate the economy and trickle down to the rest of us.  Now, AT&T is saying thank you to America by prepping mass layoffs in ten of its operational hubs in New York, California, Texas, New Jersey, Washington State, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, and Washington, DC. They've also cut investment in broadband rollout.  https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxeg/atandt-preps-for-new-layoffs-despite-billions-in-tax-breaks-and-regulatory-favors
You looked at the TelePrompTer. You did not look the camera in the eye the way Presidents give Addresses to the People of the United States.  It was awkward, monotonous and numbers sounded very inflated.  You were told to make this address despite your better judgment.  It was weak, and left it to the Democrats for a solution.  Weak and very unpresidential on your part.  Open the Government. Set talks for border security.  You can do it immediately.  Congress will still try to find their zippers.

It is really scary to see how many people in government get away with murder...literally. A government big enough to give you everything you want, is a government big enough to take away everything that you have."

Those who supported walls, fences, barriers, etc. for the US-Mexican border BEFORE the current POTUS took office, but now have some hardliner's objection to it, also have a moral and political obligation to explain why they have changed their minds. If these partisan tools can't justify their reversal with REAL WORDS, then they should be ignored for disrespecting our intelligence.
They are trying to keep you from fulfilling your promise. They were for securing the border before you were elected President, just as you said in your speech.  In my opinion they are trying to compete with you for Power. You have the highest office in the land and they are trying to overpower you. They need to be reminded, you are ,President. They are suppose to be working with you for the good of the people.

Hasn‚Äôt enough barbarism happened everywhere white peoples have settled? You‚Äôre not superior and God I think is teaching you that right now, especially Trump.
Why is our media arguing against the wall? They're supposed to be reporting on the pros and cons....not lobbying against our President enforcing OUR sovereignty!!! If the President is elected because he promised a wall...then of course he should do everything to build the wall.
I say put those caravan people to work building the wall. Create some nice tent cities with food etc, teach them to speak English and then if they prove to be great workers on the wall, learn our language and our real American values of hard work, not easy hand outs, let them stay. #kag2020, Donald J. Trump best President EVER!!!!!!

All border security is needed. Right now, most of it is shut down due to your Shut Down, that you claim you own. We all heard you. The 3rd shut down in less than a year.   How can you hire and keep the best and brightest, if you refuse to pay them? You're destroying our country.

Mr. Pres. I have a great idea to solve this shutdown and stickier boot into the Democratic Party's mouth. Tell them that you will give them the hundred and $150 billion in foreign aid, And make sure they give you the $5.8 billion for the wall. Here's the deal breaker, but I think this might work. The $54 billion if they want to add to that foreign aid, and you should do this like on camera so the whole world can see, that that $54 billion will be spent at home here in America to take care of and fix the homeless problem. Damn I need to be in politics. Because not only the Republicans would be satisfied, the Democrats would be satisfied and now America would be satisfied that is both parties would be spending $54 billion to help solve the homeless issues. Damn I'm good. Let me know what you think Mr. Donald J. Trump !... let me know if you want me to come work for Sir . /Salute - Oh and I'm prior service too Mr. President =)
Fasten you seatbelts folks ,I seen a sign and that sign   reads ,stop the hate or you will be haltered .  Signed by God .
Mr. President, please hold the paychecks of Congress and you‚Äôll see them come to the table!  That should be considered!  They‚Äôre supposed to be working for the American people not illegals and not giving money for foreign aid while our country is being invaded and drugs pouring over our borders!  When people come to our border waving the flag of their country that is an invasion.

I think you should thank your lucky stars that a terrorist doesn't try to pull another 9/11 while our government is shutdown while a few hundred TSA saying "I don't care, I'm not getting paid!"!! When there is no incentive for their being present people care less!!
And in the end they will. when they are no longer coming into our great country. And costing us millions of dollars every year. And no longer killing our American people.
Your promise was and will forever be known that " We're going to build a Wall, a great wall!! Aaand MEXICO'S GOING GO PAY FOR IT"!!! Liar!
Stand your ground Mr. President! Millions of Deplorables are behind you!!!
You are so proud to shut down the country. Your words.
You promised Mexico would pay for it.  You took full responsibility, nay, PRIDE, in shutting the government down.  Your lies aren't working.
And we the people know it! Build the wall! Demonrats biggest fear is the truth and the American people
The brown people are coming!  The orange man says the brown people are bad. He tells me to be scared.  Scared is great.  I am orange.

Kyle Sakamoto God had a wall build check it out it's in the bible ,keep reading you might learn more than that stupid.
Meanwhile, you clearly don't listen to the voice of thevmany faith leaders and loving Christians in the United Church of Christ, Methodists, Presbyterians, Mennonites, Quakers and others who speak out against the wall. Even some of the Amish who are informed of current events speak out against the wall. It is not Christian to build walls.

Point out their hypocrisy; roll the tapes, do a fireside chat; expose frivilous spending practices in the budget. Point out the fact they aren't rejecting their salaries in solidarity of the shutdown; point out that while the government is shut down they are taking VACATIONS!!! Burn Their ASSES DOWN!

Shawn Caulder they are both the same thing in principle. the government functions like the rules of a household on a bigger scale. people who live in a home are governed by those rules, and walls of a home are meant to allow authorized people to enter just as the walls of a country are meant to only allow authorized people to enter. its interesting how you do not seem to be able to internalize such an easily understood idea
Gian Dovidio that analogy makes you look like a idiot. Just fyi. Do we put a wall on east and west coast?  Canada?  Its a 10th century solution thoughtof and supported by people who are intellectually challenged.
do people live in houses without walls? lol, nope. so, why should the collective home of every american not have them?

Everything you promise will be rejected by Democrat because they want you to see fail on your administration. Illegals are Democrats safety net voters. Why was Obama and Democrats gave 150 billion dollars cash to the enemies and not allowing to protect US citizens?
Anything you say or do as a president there must people or group of people who will kick against it in away... just keep doing what you think is right in your regime... When it gets to theirs let them come and undo it. Many sick people all the place.

Mr. DJ Trump I am sure that the members of the house, the speaker of the house, and the senent wasn't elected to block what you are doing to protect America and it's borders. I have noticed that these same ones go out of their way to block your plans, even if they wanted the same thing when they were in Obama's cabinet and presidency. Please don't give up your plans, you are doing a better job than any one before you. I praise God for you.
Funny that you cut tons of programs and things when you first went into office saying we had no money for health care and education and so forth but all of a sudden we have money for a wall? Are you lying to us again, Donnie?
So first year we save 270 billion Next yr we save 275 billion Wow that's simple math for democrats to understand Looks to me like wall pays for itself and is a money maker
Help me understand. Democrats say border crossings are down, how do they count them if they sneak over where there are no walls? Help me understand Democrats say drugs come in through truckers. Should be able to stop them? None come in where there is no wall?
James Mattis‚Äô resignation letter.   Dear Mr. President:  I have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.  I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.  One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.  Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions - to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.  My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.  Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.  I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.  I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.
Your promise was Mexico will pay, not 'We the People'. You lied. Again. As usual....
The wall is not effective border security at a cost that could be used elsewhere. Give up on your vanity structure and support Americans instead of yourself. You are hurting Americans, and destroying our economy.

It's obvious to everyone, if they are truthful, that their main goal is to stop Trump from fulfilling his promises, rather than work in the interest of America and its citizens.
How about using our resources to actually serve the people....no wall.
Jill Travassos Not true, not even close. Let's see your source, because you are either lying or someone misled you.
82% OF AMERICAN CITIZENS WANT THE WALL. IT'S THE #1 CONCERN OF ALL AMERICANS.
yeah.... a lot of Republicans think the wall is a stupid idea, too.
Heather Stevens why dont you?
Mary Kay Gaffney why don't you go live on the other side of the wall if you don't think it is an issue and see how safe you are

Pres. Trump says there's a 'national security crisis' at the southern border that justifies shutting down the government -- but illegal border crossings last year hit a 46-year low, and the U.S. military has already sent home half of the 5,900 troops that Trump ordered to the border before November's election.

Valentina Hansen I totally agree.  Why are we blowing away $54billion  on countries that could not care less about us.  Use that money to build the wall.
How about instead of sending 54 BILLION in FOREIGN aid, you take care of Americans first!!!!!!!!!!
The liberals are not concerned about the security of the USA.  All they want is "POWER"  If they can defeat this wall then they can declare themselves a winners.  They will be all powerful and pass any impeachments and obstacles that they want

Demoncrats are the resistance.Best thing for you to do tonight is come out and say the wall is unnecessary because border partol is doing a really great job of stopping the drugs and the illegals and the human traffickers.Tommorrow they will be telling the nation you don't want to protect it's people and start throwing the money at you.

donnaprice honey did you even GO school? THINK LONG AND HARD ON THAT. Trump has done major things for the people. Yes he could have got the wall but 24/7 the democraps are turning on him to the point they think that is their job. democraps have DONE NOTHING for the the people. they  raise taxes and give it to iran and other countries.

What is important to me is that a 6 year old boy is waiting for the new experimental drug to hopefully treat his rare degenerative disease before it is too late. The FDA is shut down and the boys doctor just gets an answering machine. How many other children are waiting also? Trump is saying without a wall he won‚Äôt open the government. He is just being stubborn. He was offered a compromise for a month to work on a solution after the gov opens back up. I just now heard someone called CNN to tell the boys mom they would see what they can do for the 6year old. What about all the other children and adults waiting for their drug to be approved? Do you have to be on TV to get help?

We want a fully functioning government, with all hard working government employees earning their salaries.  Stop the games and re-open the government NOW!  A wall will not stop the flow of drugs and the majority of immigrants are hard working, peaceful people.  Enough of the fear tactics.

Speak the truth in Love for our Country America and all
You could ask for 5 billion for cancer research Mr. President and they would appose it.    üñï them puppets. Build the wall off the 800 thousand checks your not mailing out. Keep it shut down!!

No matter your political standing you must love and protect your country.  Just hating 1 man is not a good answer, grow up.
Don't believe the FAKE news! Trump was voted in by the people! The people want a wall and border security! The people want better care for the veterans, seniors & homeless! The people want our politicians to take care of US first! Stop the fighting and take care of business!
This whole thing is a disgusting waste of time and money. What kind of 'leader' wants to shut the government just to bully his way to a 'win'?
We want security where it needs to be, not funding a self made crisis and ego stroke.   I‚Äôm looking forward to the hilarity of your circus show tonight. Remember to get out of your seats folks and actually researching the numbers since the potus has a history of lying. #TrumpsFakeNews #TemperTantrumTrump #DumpTrump #TheTrumpShutdown
What's the crisis? Tens of thousands of people coming into our country illegally every year.  Why is Trump declaring it a crisis now?  Because Democrats and Republicans FAIL to secure the border.  Both parties failed to do what was needed for DECADES.
Since it's our border. Take the money they ve given to you already, open the government the get a go fund me page so the whole Americans will contribute to it. I have 50 dollars for it already. We all need a secured home let alone a country.
Very true President how ever if the retarded Republicans would stop being so nieve an just decriminalize cannabis in the bill they proposed. The dems would be back at the table. 33 percent of that tax revenue from the decriminalization of cannabis would go to the wall. If your using all 50 states as an example that 33 percent would build the wall an still have some left over. I dont have a party choice however I recognize how corrupt an evil all parties are
Americans want a Wall, and put the dems. om the other side of it, while you are at it.
We certainly do have a choice about how to work towards solutions.  Open the government.  Stop immorally holding 800,000 Americans and their families hostage to your decision not to genuinely negotiate like our Founding Fathers required when they designed our complex method of lawmaking.  Why do you CHOOSE to hurt 800,000 Americans and their families?  This is IMMORAL. Your chosen approach is IMMORAL.

Dont promise what you cant deliver and stop lying
We are with you President Trump don't let these liberals stop you. The constitution says the President is responsible for security of our boarders.
Did you just ignore everyone saying build the wall and say no one wants it. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
Working together requires you to actually give up the idea of a stupid, pointless wall no one wants.  Learn how to collaborate and work with people who have different views than you and learn how to separate fact from fiction.  There are already plenty of bills waiting to be passed that most people ACTUALLY approve of.  Stop acting like a spoiled child.

What's more important to any American is responsible budgetary spending. Your vanity wall or metal bars is insanely expensive and ineffectual. Your fear tactics are misinformed and insane. How people believe a word of what you say is amazing.

But you promised the Mexicans would pay for your wall..hold them to it!
The majority voted for Trump, the majority voted for the wall. Pelosi and Schumer have flipped flopped on this issue over the years and ignored the problem to the point that it‚Äôs totally out of control. Mexico will pay for it one way or another regardless.

President Trump, the demorats continue to buck every change because they are cry babies, BUT what they forget is that YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT and you have researched the best way to secure the borders with the border patrol and they have called for, begged for the 'WALL', unfortunately you have a bigger wall of cry babies in the democrat party that can't get past you being elected.    PRESIDENT TRUMP WE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU AND THE WALL.   WE ARE BEHIND YOU AND ON THE SIDE OF YOU ALL THE WAY!!!!!   GO AHEAD AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!!!!!!
People overwhelmingly want security but don't let the poll numbers fool you about who thinks a wall is unnecessary or necessary.. With the leftist news outlets brainwashing folks that walls don't work, is it any wonder some buy into that drivel. If those folks were on the border with our border agents, they'd change their minds fast! Walls/barriers work and if they didn't then why put them around prisons, around our military bases, around airport runways and hangers, around electrical transformers and gee, seems under Obama they felt the fence around the White House needed to be taller, Walls, fences or barriers of some kind absolutely work!
#PROUDOFOURPRESIDENTTRUMP!   KEEP AMERICANS SAFE...NATIONAL SECURITY IS A GOOD THING. BUILD THE WALL PRESIDENT TRUMP!  WE ARE BEHIND YOU ALL THE WAY
This isn't just about the wall, it's a statement to Congress to work together on border security, immigration reform and upholding our laws by stopping sanctuary city protections. They have kicked the bucket too long and our social benefit systems are being robbed - which includes aid to vets, elderly, children, Medicaid/Medicare, social security. Not to mention the disease not treated and unvaccinated people that is causing uprisings in eradicated illnesses and diseases we had not seen, like this cold started polio. That's what this is about! Be a voice with us in telling Congress to do their jobs. If you can't donate even one dollar, sign the petition at wefundthewall . com! Thank you for caring about America's ability to sustain and help others, the right way! Please share.
You are so clueless you don't understand how government works....53 Republicans control the Senate but they need 7 Democrats to vote yes...it takes 60 votes to pass a bill to fund government and a wall.
You haven't fulfilled any yet and the majority of Americans don't want your wall republicans and democrats alike, that's why you didn't get it funded when republicans controlled all 3 branches.

There have been multiple bipartisan solutions to border security that the executive branch torpedoed. #mostcorruptadministrationever
Oh please get over yourself. If you cared anything about the people you would get over your tantrum and stop your shutdown.
Wasn't your promise NO AMERICAN TAXPAYER MONEY WILL GO TO PAY FOR THE WALL, I GUARANTEE IT? How come you can't manage to keep THAT "promise"? Maybe if your administration would stop constantly lying to the American People, they would be more likely to support you..... just a thought, it's obvious you simply are not capable of telling the truth, even when it's pathetically simple to disprove your bullshit.
As it is writing dont paytronize a influence al person .
Let‚Äôs do it!
President Trump is right!!! Democrats better realize the American people elected them to do their jobs if they don't do it that should be fired!
But you said you would own it. You would take the mantle, remember? I remember. That was WEAK, and you are a doddering fool.

Press on Mr. Trump!
Donald J. Trump  #KAG  "The shutdown sent Republican poll ratings plunging, cost the government billions of dollars and damaged the nation‚Äôs international credibility. Mr. Obama refused to compromise, leaving Republican leaders to beg him to talk, and to fulminate when he refused. For all that, Republicans got a slight tightening of income verification rules for Americans accessing new health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act."  https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/congress-budget-debate.html

Mr. President do NOT cave to the crazy American people hating foreigner loving Democrats. Call a national emergency and build the wall. Or use whatever funds are available for a border barricade and dig a 40ft deep X 40 ft wide trench lined with barbed wire on the Mexican side of the border. Also close the entire souther border. If the Republican Party caves to the dimms. Don't sign any funding packages without funding for the wall. Republicans will never win another election if you don't declare a national emergency and build the wall.

üö©Here is a statement from  üá∫üá∏JASON ROBINSON, a veteran üá∫üá∏(not me)... (copied).  "My wife is gonna be pissed that I put my dirty laundry out on FB... And I hope every single person on my feed reads this and many share it. You want to know why I‚Äôm pissed about the borders and the ‚ÄúMigrant Caravan‚Äù? I‚Äôm a 90% disabled combat vet, medically retired, like thousands of others. I‚Äôve been out of work over a year, and with the amount of VA appointments, and the amount of time per appointment, who the hell would hire me? I barely pay my mortgage and bills, I juggle repo on my vehicles and termination on utilities monthly, and we eat, ramen and cereal on a regular basis. We shop at Goodwill and frequent PawnShops not only to shop but to get loans to pay bills or maybe get something we need from time to time. Social Security won‚Äôt approve me, and State and Federal assistance programs say I am above their ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù levels, so they won‚Äôt help me. Yet some of you think it‚Äôs ok to allow migrants with nothing to offer our Nation a free pass into this country and you cannot tell me that it won‚Äôt cost the tax payer anything. I barely get approved for free lunches for my girls at school and the taxes in Virginia I cant afford to pay, and again, you want to allow these migrants to just walk in...and you want me to offer open arms?  How about you take care of us? All of us? I‚Äôm not the only one. There are many way worse than me. There are homeless. There are sick. There are hungry. In this nation. That have paid their dues. Born here. Raised here. Paid taxes here. Worked here, served here. Take care of them.  It‚Äôs time to close the revolving door of free and take care of Americans first.  Think about that crap for a second."

your promise was that taxpayers would not pay for the wall. We're among you to hold to your promise. Also, find a way to pay for it. Maybe a 70% tax on income over $10 million?

Republicans dominated for the past two years. Why are you now blaming democrats, that took over the House as of this year, for stalling the building of the wall? Not that it matters, because the wall isn't going to help. There are ways of getting around it. In all honesty, I think you're just doing what every other politician likes to do, blame the opposing party for the delays/screw ups.  Just about every single one of you are a failure.

They will do everything in their power not to help you as they know you will get voted in next year they are just out for themselves just like all the MPs in the UK they don‚Äôt give a flying toss about American people and keeping them safe
It would. Americans are sick of the illegals, sick of the corruption, sick of seeing our war veterans treated like crap, sick of Obamacare, sick of the deception and lies of the Democrats, and if Congress doesn't want to do their job, then fire them and we'll handle it ourselves with our President

In my observations, President Trump, we aren't facing Democrats anymore. We are facing off against evil, itself.   There have been jokes circulating, that if you gave a public address stating that oxygen is good for us, they would all suffocate themselves to try and slander you.   I am starting to believe this, however, because all they do is try to stop you from protecting Americans and our country.   Here is what I suggest, if Congress will not fund the border wall, begin selling the bricks to us Americans. Design some kind of order form, and we will purchase the bricks.   I am willing to work OT, to buy as many of those bricks, as I can afford.   We the people stood behind you, to beat Hillary. You think we won't do it again, against a Democrat, cry-baby congress?

Trump, remind us again which of your promises you have fulfilled so far? Repeal and Replace the ACA? You didn‚Äôt do that. Tax cuts for everyone? You didn‚Äôt do that. Show your taxes? You didn‚Äôt do that. Get North Korea to denuclearize? You didn‚Äôt do that. You have fulfilled one promise to cut taxes for corporations and the super rich. That is it. We don‚Äôt need a wall that cost $5B that can be climbed, tunneled under, flown over, or boated around. Perhaps use what little intelligence you have and use our taxpayer money on infrastructure, education, or the homeless.

Your ego driven border wall is a waste of money and most Americans (including some Republicans) knows it. You used last night's address to collect campaign contributions from your supporters in the guise of a "border wall fund" when the funds went directly to your re-election campaign. I hope there is a campaign violation related to this and possibly fraud charges.

Republicans have given amnesty to illegal aliens six times since 1986 with the Assurance from the lying liberal Democrats that they would secure the Border now here we are over 30 years later and the lying liberals have not only failed to secure the Border but they are continuing with the same lies that they've been telling for 30 years secure the southern border once and for all I'm 57 years old I've been waiting for this to happen since I was 19 and here we are watching The Lying liberals play the same game over and over again with our Southern border they do not care about the security of our country or the security of the American people the lying liberal Democrats will continue to play this game for another 30 years if we let them.

This bill will make our borders more secure. It is an important step toward immigration reform."  - President George W. Bush, 10/26/06  Today, President Bush Signed The Secure Fence Act - An Important Step Forward In Our Nation's Efforts To Control Our Borders And Reform Our Immigration System. Earlier this year, the President laid out a strategy for comprehensive immigration reform.	The Secure Fence Act is one part of this reform, and the President will work with Congress to finish the job and pass the remaining elements of this strategy.  The Secure Fence Act Builds On Progress Securing The Border  By Making Wise Use Of Physical Barriers And Deploying 21st Century Technology, We Can Help Our Border Patrol Agents Do Their Job And Make Our Border More Secure. The Secure Fence Act:  Authorizes the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along our Southern border; Authorizes more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting to help prevent people from entering our country illegally; Authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology like cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce our infrastructure at the border. Comprehensive Immigration Reform Begins With Securing The Border. Since President Bush took office, we have:  More than doubled funding for border security - from $4.6 billion in 2001 to $10.4 billion this year; Increased the number of Border Patrol agents from about 9,000 to more than 12,000 - and by the end of 2008, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents since the President took office; Deployed thousands of National Guard members to assist the Border Patrol; Upgraded technology at our borders and added infrastructure, including new fencing and vehicle barriers; Apprehended and sent home more than 6 million people entering America illegally; and We are adding thousands of new beds in our detention facilities, so we can continue working to end "catch and release" at our Southern border.

Stand firm President Trump... NEVER forget these same democrats know we need the wall. What they do not want is for you to get credit for doing something to protect America and her children. They are willing to spend billions of our tax dollars to support and encourage criminals... turn a blind eye to drug and human trafficking... hoping you fail and the voters do NOT re-elect you. They fear you because if you succeed as you have done by calling the Korean dictator's bluff and bringing a real chance for peace in Korea or how the economy is positive, unemployment numbers that are at a historic low, and bringing back real family supporting jobs... you will be re-elected. They fear another four years because of the possibility of you appointing another judge or two to our Supreme Court. Their entire effort to destroy America is to stop your success. We are the victims while they lie with cold stone orchestrated words. Your love for America is your foundation President Trump... and those that also love America and her proud history support you... 100%.AS

Load of üí©. Using FAIR statistics that have been proven wrong. Depending on the poll only 35-45% of Americans support the wall. Nothing but a monument to himself because he knows that‚Äôs the only way he will get one.

I admire Trump if there is no Trump as the president of the US right now to against China . US may be sinking into the water by China in the next 5 years. So we must vote for Trump and let him do the right way and the right time .
Democrats are playing a childish game that will eventually bite us!
I thought you said Mexico would pay for the Wall Don? So why are you asking Congress to pay for it?
Putting criminals behind bars, that would include you. Now sit back as the mass of foriegn tRump bot comment away

Great Speech Mr President Let's Secure the Border FIRST and then End the Government Shutdown last. Hows that Nancy Pelosi and Chucky Boy Schumer NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND! :) Stay Firm Mr President
It's a false sense of security they are going to keep coming through the air ports.
You need to start your own news Network.. Trump news network! Then give it to us straight once a week! Put these pos news out of business!
Lots of people are going without pay because of YOU!!!!!! Not the Democrats; Not the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, or Cupid. It's on YOU!!!! Stop the bullshit, you horrible waste of space.
We all know what you said but you can still change your mind big deal so what! If its better for the people why not? We dont need it. Its a waste of money time efforts and all sorts of necessary peoples talents and disposition towards aspects of you your administration and our country
YES, WE NEED BORDER SECURITY.

Americans want you out! Get out!

Do it, whatever it takes.Deep inside the libtards  feels the need of BORDER WALL but since they HATE PRES. TRUMP SO MUCH ,THEY DENIED IT NOW.  HYPOCRITES !!!
Is that what Democrats want us to hate them for what they are?
Don't make promises Mr.Trump that you cannot keep. Secure the border, work on good domestic and foreign relationships. You said mexico was going to pay for the wall, work with mexico you can work it out. Are you able to work well with mexico, central and south america and other nations? There is always a way to do things and it is not impossible to work things out. Be a nation builder, people do change you know, you can change other nations as well. Its how you are willing to relate and work things out with others. Don't make any promises that you cannot keep, it makes you untruthful and someone that cannot be trusted.  Undivide the house, the senate, and make it equal with both sides working together not just one against another. Be of one mind with same vision that sees the best outcome of what is best for the people and other nations. Rewrite, and update the constitution if it is possible it is old, it needs to be revised and up to date. Be a good leader and lead the people to prosperity Mr.Trump.
WHY ARENT YOU PEOPLE SCREAMING FOR A WALL ON THE NORTH BORDER?  Windsor Canada is only a bridge trip away from Detroit ... and lots and lots of Muslims live in Michigan.  WALL ON THE NORTH BORDER!

Mexico paying for a wall?  You bombed on that one, big guy.  A wall is not a magic solution for border security in the south. What about  the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans? What about Canada?
Good speech Mr President! üëç  You are doing the right thing and what we expect from you, our leader.  Now get the job done and implement the National Emergency procedure!  The Dems response was pathetic, only hoping the opportunity will pass if you cave in to their stupid demands, so that they can continue with the status quo.  Stick to your guns Sir!   We are with you and support you all the way!  God bless you! üôè
The answer is obviously obvious, and sad.  These people called Congress are at the core of Our Country, and are collecting great paychecks and benefits from our taxes, SO well taken-care of, but SO many of them won't even do their jobs and uphold The Law, so many of them are just plain un-American--all on Our dime.
Yes this wall is needed as a statement if nothing else we are fed up with the drugs and violence in our country keep it to your own selves

Stopping u is the most important thing to do because u are wasting 5 billion dollars on a stupid wall

Most US citizens want more border patrol agents, going after companies that profit from the illegals, and not a wall that won't work.
The border is fine no crisis, you are fear mongering again and you need to stop.
The people that elected him are ignorant.
Do your bone spurs stop you from grabbing them by the pussy?
If AGT and the Voice can have people from all of U.S. vote on contestants and have results in a real short time, why can‚Äôt you propose this on a vote of the American people to see what the majority of the people want? For the wall. Against the wall. Both parties abide by the results being that you all work for the American people! Just saying.
The majority of Americans know a wall is not the answer.
I don't care what the media says we want. They DO NOT speak for me. BUILD THE WALL MR. PRESIDENT!! We desperately need it!! We should have had one long ago. STAND STRONG FOR US...WE STAND STRONG BEHIND YOU !!!!!‚ù§

That's what the people put you in office for. When you consider the overall budget, the cost for the barrier is marginal. Having proper ports of entry encourages legal migration, or requests for asylum. WY encourage illegal migration and put law enforcement in jeopardy. The Democrats act like children. Mr Trumps mandate is to lead and protect the country. This is something Fems should support. It's such another instrument to control migration.
Ted Cruiz said use money seized from El Chapo drug cartel.. $14 billion.. just like local police use confiscated drug money to fight the drug problem.
Maybe if Democrats weren't taking bribe money from the Mexican cartels this wouldn't be an issue. Can't see another reason why Pelosi, Schumer, Obama, Clinton, etc would flip-flop on building a barrier.
Trump people live in a fact free haze, the majority of the world considers stupidity.

HOLD. YOUR. GROUND. We see what the traitors are doing. They want to flood America with cheap labor that they don't have to pay but they can promise benefits to all for votes.
Work together to secure the border!!! They had no problem with getting money for the Tunisia Jordan border. They had no problem denying veterans some benefits. I‚Äôm sick of the Democrats in office right now. They are not working for the people. They forgot they WORK FOR US!! They need to be doing what we elected you for. By disregarding what the American people are asking for is ridiculous. They‚Äôre not listening. They don‚Äôt care what we want. Pelosi called you a conman today. She said you have us preoccupied with the wall while doing other things you don‚Äôt want us to know. Honestly whatever you‚Äôre doing while we‚Äôre focused on the wall, you have my support. I know you love this country. I know you are trying to have our best interest at heart. I wish I could sit down and talk to you and tell you what Americans really think. I wish we could all sit down and tell you and the rest of our government the things we won‚Äôt you all to focus on. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. I am going to write a letter to you and I hope you read it. I hope everyone else follows suit. I hope everyone on all sides of the political platform to contact their congressman/congresswoman and tell them what we truly want you all to do for us. I wholeheartedly believe that the senate, house and even yourself truly doesn‚Äôt know what we would like to happen. For me less aid to other countries and more aid here for things we need. Instead of 808 million going to Jordan only send 404 million. Use that for tiny homes for anyone who is homeless. Use it for things in this country. Our money that we worked for is going to other countries. How much money is being sent to other countries per year? If they haven‚Äôt figured out how to invest that money and grow their economies you now, they never will. Take your time with your address tonight. Don‚Äôt get so hot tempered. Speak your peace and go on. This isn‚Äôt a rally, it‚Äôs an address to the nation. Treat it as such. Good luck Mr. President. We‚Äôre behind you. ‚ô•Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚ô•Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚ô•Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚ô•Ô∏è

One of the main reasons Trump got elected was because of the wall. You really think he doesn‚Äôt have support? Do you lock your doors when you aren‚Äôt home or away from home? Do you let complete strangers come inside? Well think of America as you home. We lock the doors until we know who is entering first.

If Trump does get the wall built passed without Dems support and it does make a difference, the Dems are going to prove to everyone that they didn‚Äôt pass it because they don‚Äôt like trump. If you see the videos of them saying we need to control immigration and build barriers, then they are on stalling because Trump is keeping his promises and they don‚Äôt like a politician who keeps his promises. I don‚Äôt care who pays for it as long as it gets taken care of. I know many people who have come here the legal route.

I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Fuk off dude your about as stoned as one can get without having a stroke out.  How much powder are you inhaling?  Damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
If it's Donald J. Trump's idea, the dems don't want it.  They hate him more than they care about America.

What's more important to Democrats you ask? Getting you out of office and a real president in. One that is not a liar, crook, and Russian/North Korea lover; one who doesn't think they are a dictator and one who upholds the constitution (and has read it) and don't think he's above the law. That's what important to Democrats...restoring the office of the president of the United States!

Roberta Anastasia  she isn‚Äôt making it up
Amy Miller you are making this up. I am from a military family and we are heartsick over how this draft dodger has ruined this country and now causing hardship to ours.
Roberta Anastasia Keep it shut down! We are a military family and fully support the government shutdown. Being a military family and living on post, I have gotten to hear how many other military families feel about the shutdown and 99% of then AGREE!
The country wants the government open!
They don't seem to care about the safety of Americans. I have tried and tried to get a copy of the Democrats plan and the cost of it and can't find anything but political banter anywhere !
Hey here's the problem the dumbrats and George Bush talked about border security. They also talked about building wall I meant a fence. But the fact is none of them had the balls to get it done. So now with one more year till the 2020 election  the dumbrats don't want the  wall built because they won't have those illegal Voters. The Dumbrats also don't won't Trump to go in the history books as a President that kept he's promise to the American People awhile keeping America Safe  and also making America Great once again.

Whem Pres Trump says 4000 undocumented illegals crossed over the southern border, the ICE stats suggest he is right!  ICE says ‚Ä¢  Over a 10-year period (2005-2014) ICE arrested approximately 4,000 MS-13 members, leaders, and associates. This represents about 13 percent of all gang members they arrested nationwide (31,000) during that period.  ‚Ä¢  92 percent of the MS-13 affiliated aliens arrested were illegal aliens.
Fact: Illegal border apprehensions are at a 46 year low. Fact: 0 terrorists have been found crossing our southern border. Does this sound like a "crisis" worth harming 800,000 Americans over? Get your facts from reputable sources, rather than this ass-clown president!
The most important thing to democrats is using their buzzword tantrums in place of real arguments to control people through mob rule. Nothing new happening with them. Stay on strike all year long if you need to and include cuts to the DNC paychecks to pay actual employees that deserve it. :)
Great job sir. Proud to call you my Present. We need a wall. Please keep fighting for us.
While we are at it deport every single illegal that voted in our elections, charge every single American that processed all their write in ballots as votes.................Michael
Mr. President , you know the way around it. Do what needs to be done for U.S.. BUILD THE WALL!!!!!
Build the wall mr president we stand behind you.
We want to hear from the President, not the news channels.
Just shutdown the border I guarantee you the Mexican government will build that wall in record time
While trump wants to build a wall the enemy are already in the Whitehouse, Russia straight in the front door with arms wide open.
Donald Trump for Prison 2020
I think the initiative should be taken further than just a fence.
LOL his PROMISE was to have MEXICO pay for it.  He lies... it will be fun to see him FACT CHECKED tonight by credible sources.

If everyone in America  pays 17.00 we have  5.5 billing to build a wall
I know you're a billionaire Trump, just use your own money to build the wall, problem solve!
Great job mr. President. Build the wall do whatever you have to do
Yes!! We need that wall immediately, but must have doors in case if we need them for any reason.
We want the wall just as much as you president...we need it.
We want the wall just as much as you president...we need it.
Start a fund raising for Protecting our USA from those who believe otherwise.And use as tax right off also its for a good cause
Why don‚Äôt you just lie to the American people a few more times. Mexico will pay for the wall. What a joke this clown is.
Since the democrats have caused the government shutdown let them pay the wages for all the employees not receiving a paycheck because of their drama! Schumer and Pelosi should be the first to make payments out of their own non earned wages!!!
I love this plan.  I love in fl . Huge impact for us.  100% support wall plan.  Maybe much less should have been spent in Russian investigation.  We are with you

Damn those airplanes ‚úàÔ∏è and boats üö£  got past my 5.5 billion dollar üíµ wall again   Damn !   now what  !!
President Trump stand  firm  and  build  the  wall.
Dear Mr. President, since you, the senate, and the house of representatives have chosen not to work with each other I suppose that none of you  been denied you salaries in regard to the shutdown...what a surprise.  Does that mean I don't owe taxes for the weeks or months that this shutdown is in effect?  Afterall if I'm not receiving services why should I pay for it?
Funny how new trade deal with Mexico will pay for the barrier indirectly. So Trump did figure out a way to get Mexico to pay for the barrier. Smart move . Dems can't keep up .
We do NOT need this wall, I am a hard working citizen and want to go out clubbing on the weekends without having my price of cocaine upcharged 200%! The only compromise I would be willing to make is if we could open cocaine dispensaries!
If Mexico pays for it. Show us the money. Better yet show us your plan.
What a wonderful speech.  He is such a great patriot for our nation.
US politics is quite puzzling to a lot of us in the UK.  I seem to remember the promise DT made was that the Mexicans would pay for a wall to be built.  Until that money has been made available, it seems undemocratic to take the money of US citizens to pay for it - there are so many good causes that need that money, ordinary people who could benefit from improvements in services.  Also, has anyone ever wondered if it‚Äôs really to keep people out?  I remember a big wall being built under those circumstances in Europe post war and it‚Äôs main function, far from keeping out the bad guys, ended up preventing so-called free people from leaving their own country, often being shot in the process.  Walls rarely create long term benefits and they mostly separate, they don‚Äôt bring people together.  Sadly, isolation policies cost much in terms of trade opportunities and standard of living in the countries that impose such ideas - even here there are short-sighted people trying to initiate debilitating isolation whilst caring nothing for how the economic costs of such plans will affect the least empowered in our society...
Thank you, Mr. P for standing up for the Citizen!  Give them an ultimatum; "It's either a Wall or you will cut off Healthcare and Education to the illegal, law breaking, NON Citizen"

So how is Mexico paying for the wall again? Another false promise. Typical üòÇ
Take the money from Congress they are not working for their fat paychecks
The majority of Americans do not want a wall.  Stop with your Fear Mongering LIES
When nancy said you lied just now...I turned it off.   If I happen to listen to the news I will hear her and Chuck for the next week with the same crap that I just blocked out of my life for the evening. These people are nuts and I wish they would go away.
"BUILD THE WALL"!!!!!!!  It's about time we have a president that really cares about our country and for the people. It has been a long time coming. Toooooo long! Go Mr President!!!!! Very proud to have him!!!!
EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT,EXCELLENT SPEECH, MR PRESIDENT!
no matter the outcome we are on your side sir
Your promise was ....MEXICO will pay for the wall.  Not...the AMERICAN tax payers will pay for the wall.   Please be honest in your statements.   Please remember why you voted for Trump!
President Trump you are the best president I have ever seen , I am a hard worker  and have lost my insurance after I wAs told I was grandfathered in i am so tired of people who want something for nothing  theirs lot's of people who want me to start a militias to stop this night   MAre
Stand your ground on this it‚Äôs been needed for years!!!!!
But you promised M√©xico would pay, and instead you‚Äôre trying to pass the cost off to taxpayers... some of whom, you‚Äôve stopped from getting paychecks at all. And the majority of us who are already struggling even with our paychecks.
#Declassify FISA and stop the nonsense.
If President Trump said we should all breathe the Dems would start holding their breath!

Mr. President - As a Navy veteran I know that you did not swear to protect the country when you were sworn in to office. You swore to protect & defend the Constitution of the United States just as I did when I was sworn in to the Navy. The last two years of my enlistment I was stationed at the Fleet Area Control & Surveillance Facility In Jacksonville, Florida. While there our air traffic controllers would detect planes and ships trying to evade detection, which would turn out to be bringing drugs into the country. The point being our border with Mexico is not the only way drugs and people are coming into the county illegally. what do suggest; a dome like in the Simpson Movie.
Shut down the border show Mexico we mean business
Democrats are all in on following the Luciferian agenda.
Look out,,its the nancy and chuck show, they really are out of touch,and im not even an american..
I have friends that lived near the border that must hide belongings as things were stolen from their yards.
Declared a National Emergency and build the wall to secure our boarders Mr. President.
Interesting listen...  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2468045599876608&id=1102865066394675
The question is why don't democrats want border security???? It baffles me. I know it's for the votes, but they are really willing to trade their own security for votes? Why??????
I wounder how many people who are against the wall donate to these other countries! This should show all americans how much the Democratic elites care about them when they have walls themself. Democrats just want votes and are willing to put you at risk to get them! Wake up! Build the wall!
Because you Mr President said that Mexico would pay not the American tax payers  that's why.
Consider Compromise  yes to security
Great speech, Mr. President. You call Dems who they truly are.
Just seen Dem response to address. Do I think Dems see security one way and Republicans see it another....yes. Do I think only unity can end the shutdown....yes. So, let's approve both methods....simple!
Your doing a ‚ÄúGreat Again‚Äù job pres. keep up the good work!
Withhold pay from Congress and the Senate. They are withholding pay from their constituents because they refuse to negotiate. It's time their pockets are empty. If they were under pay for performance they would wouldn't get a check. Better yet if you cant hold their pay then encourage them to donate their pay to those who are hard working individuals, doing the jobs most of them never would and now they are doing it without pay
This is one reason why Americans vote for you!  Build the wall.  Don‚Äôt cave to the bullies!
anyway is 911 war or wto war nobody want to die
We want border security and a wall as high as you can build it. The American people own this country not Congress!
UP THE RESISTANCE  STOP TRUMP AT ALL COSTS F.... the American M... F...ers
They don't want you to win! They will never give it to you and that is the only reason. They pretend the voters didn't want this. Someone send them the chants from all your rallies "Build the Wall"
KEEP IT SHUT DOWN! It hasn't affected my life one bit.
Mr Trumpski, the truth is the most important thing - truth and clarity. We are talking about a man without a plan, only interested in money at any cost. A wall will not keep Americas enemies out for they sit in the Whitehouse.  Manaforte taking money from Russia, guilty of tax fraud, providing inside polling info to Russian spy, secret deals with Russian spy in Madrid on Americas stance on Russian sanctions eye- the truth is out there
President Trump: Please end the government shutdown.  I'm for better border security but does it have to be a Wall?
I have the wall courtesy of the democrats and hilary clintons.
We are with you, Mr. PRESIDENT.   Chuck and  Nancy are lifetime politicians =liars!
We are with you, Mr. PRESIDENT.   Chuck and  Nancy are lifetime politicians =liars!
What‚Äôs most important is for you to keep your word and get the money from Mexico like you said. You didn‚Äôt mislead your voters did you. That‚Äôs there sticking point. Don‚Äôt build a wall build a shipping canal that‚Äôll create jobs on both sides and they won‚Äôt want to come. Then build a Super-max Wall if you want. This way both country‚Äôs pay for the canal share in the overall upkeep and profits it‚Äôs a business deal a win win deal and your the master of the business world. Thanks best wishes.
Wouldn't it be cheaper to electrify the wall that we already have? Plus these drug dealers use boats in the Gulf & Pacific coast, as well as small planes. Plus, people that use illegal drugs will (sadly enough) just make their own.
It won‚Äôt matter.  Rage politics is only answer dems have.
oh stfu Chancy (thats Chuck and Nancy) just build the fkn wall and STFU!
Trump you need to see this. you can fund the wall this is how. https://www.teaparty.org/chuck-norris-comes-brilliant-solution-fund-wall-youve-got-hear-340586/
Americans want border security!
I think Mr. President that once this wall goes up you should find all the homeless vets, and give them housing and a pay check and have them patrol the wall. It will bring down the rates of homeless people in America, and it will help the vets giving them a purpose.
I am not against stopping the inflow. My concern is your background as a builder and a stubborn temperament. Are their tech alternatives, sensors and drones - for that price get Musk to pop a bird up there.
I called Congress for you brother..from kalifornia..
Life need to be secured first before think about something else!
Dem's just want to win. They hate the President and will do anything to make him loose. They care nothing about the American people. We voted Trump in because he will fight against the establishment.
Thank you President Trump, Do Not give up to those trolls,  Be strong,the people with you
I think the market cares more about a trade deal with China than a government shutdown.However, if the shutdown continues Trump may lose consumer and business confidence.
It‚Äôs obvious that it‚Äôs all about the wall...I support it, but don‚Äôt support all of us Americans you are hurting,including myself
We need the wall 60 years ago.
I'm all for boarder patrol and a wall but how much of this money is coming from trumps pocket or out of the pockets of are high up political figures. I know money is being pulled out of my mother's pocket who has worked for this government for over 25 years and if she can't make her house payment that will leave her homeless how many of a government officials are looking at loosing there homes if this shutdown continues.....
Mexico should pay for it! Go get the money!!!
Stand strong Pres. Trump and don‚Äôt give in to any amnesty deal.  Reagan gave amnesty in return for a securing our border.   They got their amnesty and our borders are still wide open.  One American life lost because of an illegal, is one to many.
I am from West Africa {Nigeria} but I support you Donald J Trump. Protect your country. Build the wall.

I think there is no point of the wall because face it we already know how to fly airplanes and dig tunnels and still have other ways yo get in the country no matter what you do
But Mexico was going to pay for it.

Americans would regret not building their border wall in future. Just like Nigeria is regretting,  If the wall is not built on time , Americans would loose control over the immigrants and the only escape would be to run away, just like few people who survived the massacre in northern Nigeria deserted their homes. Now the people who are playing politics with these immigrants would loose their control over them, just like it happened in Nigeria.

President looked weak last night. When you are coming from a strong position you don‚Äôt have to justify yourself. He convinced me last night the wall is MORE worthless and pointless than it was on Monday.
It is just not about Trump..it is against the electors of Trump they are after. The left is of one mind..Trump or someone like him is to never be elected again
Trumptards are so gullable. They'll believe any bullshit Donathon tells them.

This LEGAL CUBAN IMMIGRANT REFUGEE is proud of you and proud of MY RED, WHITE AND BLUE.   God bless the troops, God bless you and yours and may God FOREVER bless the USA...  Home of the free, BECAUSE of the BRAVE!  Donald J. Trump
I recently asked my Mexican friend how his relatives back home felt about a wall being built. He said they will get over it.
I'm ready to hunt down these Shapeshifting Reptilians kill em all!!!!
Maury Masalin we are going to let you pay for itüòú
You promised Mexico was going to pay for the wall......
After the great negotiator failed to get mexico to pay for the wall, how did he fail got get funding when he had all three branches of govt? LOL
With that atrocious grammar yes, i'd say she watches judge Jeanie because judge Jeanie talks like a crazy Puerto Rican woman from the Bronx. I don't believe she ever graduated law school, she can't even conjugate a sentence.
Well you also promised better heath care. You also promised Mexico would pay For the wall.
God Bless our President Donald J. Trump..God Bless our Border Walls..Goe Bless all who stand and protect our United States Constitution and its Citizens!
Well, Mr. President, where Schumer and Pelosi are concerned, the first thing I think of is that there is no GLORY for them in sitting down and working together with you for a secure BORDER.   And that is important to them. They prefer to draw the line in the sand...they are stronger within the Democrat Party when they can work against you, and, for sure, they aren't interested in your ability to fulfill promises...just the opposite.  üá∫üá≤üôèStand your ground...for AMERICA!  God Bless You!

Kevin Carlson  Perhaps it us their neediness & connection to drug & human trafficking.
Build a wall on only one border. Looks to me like you don‚Äôt like the people on the other side, or why wouldn‚Äôt you build it on the Canada side too? You and your followers are motivated by the color of those on the other side of the wall you wish to build.
Polls say building that wall is not that important to Americas
Make a poll!! Post the link on twitter and have a honest to god poll right here on fb!!  üëç üëç

...  I 100% support President Trump. I offer no apology for what I am posting, for this is truly how I feel. This is my opinion, not a debate. If you disagree, or find my position offensive, I am perfectly fine with that. Feel free to unfriend me if we cannot agree to disagree. I wont debate or argue my beliefs. I have lived through several United States Presidents prior to our current President Trump. In my lifetime, I have never seen nor heard of a President scrutinized over every word he speaks, humiliated by the public to the point of disgrace, slandered, ridiculed, insulted, lied to/about, threatened with death, had his wife and our First Lady disrespected, and his minor child insulted, threatened and harassed.  I am ashamed and saddened by the ruthless, meanspirited, hateful, cruel, biased people who display themselves as having no civic pride, morals, ethics, decency or respect for our country's traditions and values. My elders and teachers taught me many years ago to respect our President, whether I voted for them or not. All the news stations and reporters who feel they have the right to perpetuate blatent lies and fabricate "facts" for a "good story" are dividing our country beyond belief. Many only report the negative "news" and never the accomplishments of our President. If people do not research everything put out by the MSM, they are left to believe all the hate mongering news. This is leading to so much intolerance that I feel we are nearing the brink of a civil war! No other President that took the oath of office, has been on the news 24/7, scrutinized for their every word, facial expression, decision, handshake, what he eats... NO, he is not perfect, far from it! No President or person is, including you and I!!!!! Yes, he makes stupid comments and doesn't use the flowery language of a "professional politician". However, I believe he truly loves the United States of America and works tirelessly to make things better for us all. He is very different than what we've become accustomed to, thank goodness. The people who would rather see our country fail than help him do his job need to stop. I was always taught "If you can't be part of the solution then at least don't be part of the problem". I personally want our President Donald Trump, as I did his predecessors, to succeed. To hope for failure is INSANE. United we stand; divided we fall!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ COPY AND PASTE IF YOU'RE SICK OF IT TOO!

The government shutdown is your fault Trump, you said you would own it. So own it! You can't pass the buck on this one!
They rather have Americans suffer  and not appear weak to stop the president from looking good to voters
If you found a cure for cancer they would oppose it.
Dems are babies!!  The politicians and the voters. They cry and whine when they don‚Äôt get their way. We raised 20million!  That means we want the wall. We want immigrants, just not illegal ones!!
,I'm announcing my candidacy for President in 2020 Looking for a VP She has to be hot.. Mckinnon/ ??? 2020 #MASA Maake America Sexy Again.
We all want border security. But only 30% want a wall. Funny thing...30%..is also the amount of Americans diagnosed with delusions.
Maybe all that win win they lose is the problem.

No! Americans want you to get hit by a truck!
Did he just say, Democrats aren‚Äôt Americans??
Flood the tunnels too... Then work on airport security and other means of entry.  And do not forget those who have overstayed their visa.
I want border security just not a worthless pointless wall. A 10 mile moat would work better anyway
Stay strong President Trump. We the people are behind you!!  Build the Wall!!  Go gettem Trumpster!!
Praying for you!  Praying for America!
Wow the liberal comment never seen to amaze meü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è why are they so stupid and brainwashed? Like honestly!!
Your own propaganda machine!  Fox News. Also, wanting border security is not synonymous with a wall. Ff
They gave you funding for border security, just not a wall.
Why won't yall pay for the wall since you want the wall ? Its real simple
Yes we want the Wall built!!! Keep our country safe.
The Democrats are opposing the President ONLY BECAUSE they are just about obstruction!!!  THEY KNOW the Border needs a wall and security...see below:  https://www.facebook.com/redpillusa/videos/223178005279698/The Caucasian ManDemocrats: ‚ÄúShiiiiiiiiieeeet‚ÄùPlay Video
I have friends and family in prison. If walls didn't work, they'd be out causing mischief.
Hold The Line Pres Trump !!!!! Do not back off !!!!!
open the government then talk immigration. Just because Trump promised a big beautiful wall doesn't mean he gets what he wants. He constantly lies about everything
Missed your speech, Donnie.  I was watching your girlfriend fold her clothes on Instagram.
AMERICANS WANT TRUMP IN PRISON FOR TREASON
Well that's a no brainier . Anything to stop Trump
Just say the word  Mr.President and we'll come down there and build it our Damn selves
I personally think you should let Democrats have this one, you‚Äôll still get your wall built just you should surprise everyone & show the Democrats that you can bend but you won‚Äôt break
You tell them Trump! God bless the 45th. Our children and grandchildren will thank you. Make it big make it beautiful. #Trump2020  #BUILDTHEWALL

If Trump thinks Mexico will pay, tell him to keep up all the records of the so-called money we are getting from Mexico and when it gets to $5.8 billion, he can show Congress and get the wall built.
The odds makers are taking bets on how many times Trump will lie tonight. http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-trump-lies-gambling-speech-odds-35-bet-20190108-story.html
Good old Fox - straight from Trump's playbook....fabricated numbers, lies, twisted logic & putting false words in peoples' mouths....I expect Trump to spew Fox's rhetoric in this lie-filled article almost word for word (except pausing mid-sentence to repeat the bigger words & sniff)...what a maroon...
Mexico isn't gonna pay for his vanity project, it never was going to pay for it. Trump told a lie. Now Trump wants the US taxpayer to pay for his vanity project, and his supporters are so brain dead they aren't saying to Trump "You said on several occasions that Mexico would pay for the wall, not us!"
Scott Czeiszperger how about the wall or no paychecks for the demo rats üêÄ
Travis Copsey I agree but they will never let that happen the least we can get out of it is our wall.

Don't give them a damn dime for foreign aid unless we get our wall.
Faux News!  Haha haha!  Also known as the Trump propaganda channel.
Democrats want to turn all of the common citizens of the world into slaves for the ruling global elite.
You have not kept your promise! You have not and collected the money from Mexico. The fact is, you and you alone are responsible for not finishing that wall. You had both houses and two years time mr. trump. The question is what stopped YOU, mr. trump, building the wall?
There is difference between border security and a wall. I fully support border security. There needs to be a compromise between all or nothing, a wall is a waste of resources. Right now we have TSA workers calling off putting our airports at risk. Any president who would do that doesnt care about security, he cares about an absurd campaign promise and power.

Wait, for a grand total of 1 promise kept? When does that check come in from mexico btw?
Mexico pays everyday because of tarrifs we get from them. That is what Trump meant
Mexico pays everyday because of tarrifs we get from them. That is what Trump meant
The wall should come as soon as Mexico pays for it...that was his campaign promise!
Judy Conrad  the cartels are a multi billion dollars even trillion dollar industry ... why because Americans feed off their drugs ..... it‚Äôs a drug epidemic here. If we ask for drugs they will supply. Going beyond that they have submarine, airplanes , hundreds of tunnels already in place, boats, drones, catapults... you think a wall is going to stop them from making trillions of dollars. Ha!
Chrisopher Hernandez,  What is the answer?
Duh! We all want border security but a dumb wall is not the answer .
Yes, Potus, Americans, all Americans want border security, just not an ineffective wall.  Your campaign promise was that Mexico would pay for the wall, which they aren't, so promise broken.  Now drop the wall and negotiate increased cbp personnel, technological defenses and other effective defenses.
A wall is not a COMPLETE immigration policy  which is what we need
I don't care who pays for the wall, we need it,
More LIES from adulterous, hateful, lying, inept, dense and very CORRUPT 45. OLD 45 promised that Mexico would pay for the  WALL. Polls show Americans want border security not ridiculous WALLS.
Incompetent 45 doesnt care that our national security is in big jeopardy today. The TSA agent arent getting paid and are calling out sick. Our airports where most of the terrorists and drugs come through are NOT secure due to CORRUPT 45s SHUTDOWN!  Adulterous 45 is a disgrace!
BUILD THE WALL STAND STRONG WE BACK YOU 100 % TRUMP
BUILD THE WALL STAND STRONG WE BACK YOU 100 % TRUMP
Border security yes.  Border wall no.  There is money in the House appropriation bill for border security including fencing.
"How I heard it:  Trump: "Let's spend a couple of bucks and fix the brakes on this car."  Schumer: "Brakes are ineffective at stopping cars!"  Pelosi: "We have more than enough money in the budget for body work after a crash! Besides, who cares about the people we might run over?"
We stand with President Trump! Build the wall!!

Watching your speech tonight. China has a wall and it goes for miles. Democrats want 54 billion dollars in foreign aid, look how much money could be saved if we forget all this foreign aid and take 5 billion dollars to build a wall or strong fence. God told Nehimiah in the old testament to build a wall to protect Jerusalem. Several years back the Democrats wanted better border security and a wall.

Watching a couple of the most bizarre people I have ever had to listen to, trying to convince the American people that they are the good guys.   Pelosi was certainly ineffective in convincing me.    Watching them, it was hard not to notice how hard they were trying, but as a mom, they looked more like a couple of little kids trying to talk their way out of trouble.  The body language was almost funny if it were not so scary to know they are part of our government.    Pelosi seemed to need her big brother standing there.  Like they think there is a chance that two of them outnumbers Trump.  Lol.  Watching her face, wow.  She looked she wanted to bust out screaming like a bratty child who is not getting her way and Somebody better pay attention to her and do what she says.    Chuck? well, he was there.

Of course Americans want border security. That's like saying people want sunshine and happiness. Duh! The thing is, we're a 200 year old country--if we didn't already figure out how to secure our borders, we wouldn't be here. This is a made-up problem---anyone with common sense can see that!

I've toured the border with CBP agents, and you know what they first showed me? THE TUNNELS. But no, let's throw money away on a useless deterrent to non-violent people....
Gonna have a lot of pissed off Americans if you keep up with shutdown, can't take foodstamps away from those who are in need of it. A lot of the American people who are on food assistance for their kids and WIC are going to be against you! This is uncalled for. And you can't expect people to work for free! #justsaying
Stand strong Mr President build the wall
We need to build border wall for Americans security
Mr. President, you said that Mexico would have to pay for the wall. How about we take foreign aid money from Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, etc. and fund that wall. Why do we continue to provide aid to countries who won't take care of their own people.
Help  people  Sudan  don't  the ferydam
Tell them to give their paychecks to those that are not getting paid!
I am not in favor of constructing a border wall, but you aren't interested in my opinion or representing me as an American. You only seem interested in representing your "base." Weren't you elected to represent ALL the people?

I was so disappointed, rejected at the SA embassy yesterday.  I wanted to visit Disneyland!! How bad is that your staff rejected me???? You humiliated me, I lost all respect for USA now  so disappointed. Lady judged me in a 10 second interview. Australia beats your country.  Cant believe it
Janice Leigh Schroder God Does not condone murder by aliens that are hateful illrgals

Proud of the resolve of this President
Have you heard of things called tunnels Donald? Or, how about ladders?
The only true way forward is together. A strong future is built on the backs of many and no part in it is any less important than the other. We will get there together Mr. President!
I just called 800.350.6647 to support President Trump on the wall
I am not a Trump fan. I am Democrat üíØ and will be voting that way in 2020. If someone can show me some data showing the walls effectiveness and that the 5.6/7 billion he is requesting will achieve that effectiveness I will support the wall. I do not want Trump to fail. I don‚Äôt care who is in office. I want our president to succeed and make this country better. I do not support open borders as a lot of Republicans have said. I am very aware that we cannot take everyone in and still be able to take care of ourselves. I know we need to have a limit. I do care about America despite what Republicans think. If Trump has a lasting positive impact for this country then I will be glad he represented America. It is very sad to see this country so divided. Democrats are just as much involved in this shut down as Republicans. Neither side is willing to compromise. I hope a compromise can come soon so Trump can prove me wrong and maybe change my mind in not voting for him in 2020.

Why is the wall so important? Criminals will find away to get in like dig a tunnel. Oh wait they already do that.
Our family is with you Mr. Trump stand firm and keep standing up for our country we are proud to have you as our President.
Mr, President, Why do you not cut the pay of all of Cogress and take away all the perks they receive as a member of Congress, then perhaps they will see the light !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Very proud of you Mr. President stay strong
Seems people do not understand the objective. The objective is to STOP people from crossing the border illegally. The objective is not catch and release like we do in sport fishing. The only electronic method that would stop illegal crossing would be drones programmed to shoot and kill. Building a wall is far more humane.
Stay Strong!! I am an former Air Force wife and live in Texas. I want the wall. If the Dem want to drag this out, so be it. Sad, but not surprised.
We can/could have better border security.  We do not require a wall of concrete or steel.  Double ICE's budget, hire more BPA, crack down hard on illegal employment of aliens, add lawyers to challenge sanctuary cities...  My God, I could put $5b to much better use!!!
We need to build one like the Germans did.
This has to be one of Manford‚Äôs Russian Facebook tied Facebook pages

Build that wall Mr. President, thank you!
You promised Mexico would pay for the wall.
Thank you President Trump for your Oval Office address.  Maybe a national crisis needs to be called.  This nonsense resistence towards you and your administration  is a disgrace to our nation.  Please do not give in to Chuck and Nancy. Thank you and God bless!

Build the wall president trump! Keep up the good work
Mr President, I do agree we need to secure our borders, but we need to build a smart wall not a wall like China built 2000 years ago and it was useless. Sensors, heat cameras, drones, AI, etc - not bricks... c‚Äômon!
Border security is very important.  However, the method proposed should be questioned. One cannot successfully resolve a 21st century problem with 5th century technology(wall). One only needs to look back in history....The Maginot Wall....built by the French in the 1930s  to prevent German invasion.  We all know how that went.
Funny how the media quickly side with Democrats 100% need the wall. These families women and children can easily come over legally and get visa and go through process like all the legal immigrants from Mexico.
I'd rather pay for a wall then all the benefits we pay out #buildthewall#standstrongamerica

If you do not have money, use the Mexicans to build the wall. You could pay them with a green card...
E-Verify. Stop hiring illigals. Fine businesses who hire them. Put Americans first. Stop the feebees. And yes, how about a double wall with a solid dirt road between them so border control can do their job.
"That is power, the mob is Rome. And while Commodus controls them he controls everything."
Thanks Mr president build the wall!!!!!
Americans want their tax refund check.... üòù
Thank you Mr President.  Stand your ground and please keep fighting for us.  #Trump2020
Please president Trump help us I hope you get the money you ask for from Congress for the wall and end this government shutdowns
Why do the Congress and Senate still get paid with the govt shutdown?  Take away their pay just like everyone else and see how fast things get done.
Just assuming, most of these comments aren‚Äôt coming from those on furlough or those working and not getting paid. Please go to your bosses and tell them you won‚Äôt accept a paycheck until the shutdown has ended. Let me see how many of the base reacts after you can‚Äôt pay your bills because he can‚Äôt have a wall. Kind of like if you don‚Äôt play the football game the way I want I‚Äôll take my ball and go home. Kidsey stuff.
1. Walls don‚Äôt work. Illegal immigrants have tunneled underneath and/or erected ramps up and down walls to simply drive over them. People find a way. When East Germany erected its wall, it created a military zone, staffed by booted, machine-gun carrying guards ready to shoot to kill. Yet thousands managed to make it to West Germany anyway. More to the point, do we really want to model ourselves after communist East Germany?  2. Most illegal immigrants are ‚Äúoverstayers.‚Äù They come to the US legally ‚Äî for vacations, business, to study, etc. ‚Äî and then STAY past their visas. By 2012, overstayers accounted for 58% (THE MAJORITY!) of all unauthorized immigrants. A wall is meaningless here!  3. Walls have little impact on drugs being brought in to the US. According to the DEA, almost all drugs come in through legal points of entry, hidden in secret containers and/or among legit goods in tractor-trailers. A wall will have little to no impact on the influx of drugs into our country.  4. It‚Äôs environmentally impractical. Walls have a hard time making it through extreme weather. For example, in 2011, a flood in Arizona washed away 40 feet of STEEL fencing. Torrential rains and raging waters do serious damage. Also, conservative sources generally do not address the environmental harm that walls create, but there is plenty of documentation available that show its potential for irreparable damage to both plant and animal life.  5. A wall would forces the U.S. government to take land from private citizens in eminent domain battles. Private citizens own much of the land slated for the wall. The costs of the government snatching private land ‚Äî and the legal battles that would ensue ‚Äî are incalculable.  6. Border patrol agents don‚Äôt like concrete or steel walls because they block surveillance capabilities. In other words, they can‚Äôt mobilize correctly to meet challenges. So in many ways, a wall makes their job more difficult.  7. Border patrol agents say, ‚ÄúWalls are meaningless without agents and technology to back them up.‚Äù Are we prepared to pour countless billions annually ‚Äî after the wall is built ‚Äî to create a nearly 2,000 mile, militarized 24-hour surveillance border operation? Because according to patrol agents, that‚Äôs the only way a wall would work. Again, are we really, going to use East Germany, a brutal communist state, as our model here?  Are we seriously going to model ourselves on East Germany and their wall? A 1979 celebration in E. Berlin. 8. Where walls have been built, there was ‚Äúno discernable impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens.‚Äù In other words, they came in elsewhere, primarily where natural barriers such as water or mountainous regions precluded a wall.  9. An unintended consequence is that a wall blocks farmworkers from EXITING when their invaluable seasonal work is done. Farmers are against the wall because it makes getting cheap seasonal labor almost impossible as few American citizens want or can even do those jobs. And if seasonal worker do get in, a wall makes it harder for them to leave! A wall traps migrant farm laborers in our country.  10. Trump‚Äôs $5 billion is a laughable drop in the bucket for what would ACTUALLY be needed. For example, according to the Cato Institute: An estimate for a border wall area that only covered 700 miles was originally 1.2 billion. How much did it REALLY cost? SEVEN BILLION. And that‚Äôs only for 700 miles. Whatever we think it‚Äôs going to cost, experience shows us we have to multiply it by more than 500%.  11. According to MIT engineers, the wall would cost $31.2 billion. Homeland Security estimates it at $22 billion. Given the pattern of spending mentioned in number 10 (plus Murphy‚Äôs Law), that means we‚Äôre really talking about pouring endless billions into something that doesn‚Äôt even work. And, of course, we taxpayers will be footing the bill, not Mexico. Given all the drawbacks, is that REALLY the best use of our taxes?  As the conservatives of the Cato Institute put it, ‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs wall would be a mammoth expenditure that would have little impact on illegal immigration.‚Äù (Emphasis mine) Also it would create many ‚Äúdirect harms:‚Äù ‚Äúthe spending, the taxes, the eminent domain abuse, and the decrease in immigrant‚Äôs freedoms of movement.‚Äù
They don't fulfill campaign promises Mr president...they don't want you fulfilling campaign promises......
Americans  want our republic  restored, we want to regain our sovereignty reinstate our constitution and Bill of rights.  We want the united states cooperation  destroyed,  we want the criminal Federal Reserve banking cartel abolished and  our currency  returned to a value backed system.  We want the 97 percent of federal government agencies that have no right to exist under the constitution gone.  We want the traitors arrested.  The wall is  just a minor issue of  what Americans want.

Declassify everything on the Democrooks it‚Äôs time to hang them high!

Build that damn wall, long and tall !!!
Keep working for the true Americans! Thank you Mr. President Trump
I'm watching you tonight, Mr President!
Build four walls.  Small ones.  One on each side of you and I'll pay for it myself.
We support you right here in Northeast Texas Mr President! God Bless!
Don't play the blame card,Stop it.      I'm not employed,thank you.     Accept a phase in up to that amount,you expect to be re-elected right?    No concern for the bugget,nor the payments to our troops .      Demanding will not work well for you in the long run,if you want to be re-elected to see it come about.
Go for it president trump we‚Äôre behind you.
Perhaps the answer is to stop funding these countries and buy them so we can really improve their conditions.
We are giving one more penny to another country till our government takes care of ours! Pelosi Schumer your time is up!
Mr President: how do we the American People vote to have the Voted Officials Congressman and congresswomen receive the same Medical Benefits, OBAMA Care, for their health insurance.  They deserve to have all the benefits they voted for the rest of America.  We would not want them to miss out on the experience and the cost increases they have in storage for everyone else!
You did the right thing President Trump. You had to do a state of the Union because you are in this IMMIGRATION battle alone outside of all support base that's in every state in the USA.  I'm sick of the democrats, unelected big money donors, and the media dementing & rottening minds AND destroying the fabric of this country.
Stay strong President Trump!  We want border security!
Great job, Mr. President! We love and support you because you love and support all Americans. Stay strong. You are in office by the grace of God.
Thank you Mr. president for bring up, Marilyn Pharis in the central coast Santa Maria, Ca.  Marilyn Pharis death was so terrible, ruthless and painful for her not the people who did this, they get 2 trials with interpreters and 25 years for taking a beautiful life from us.
SECURITY YES WALL NO ..........AND YOUR PROMISE WAS THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY
Stand strong.  We support you Mr. President.
During your campaign you said you were a negotiator and would work with both parties. In case you are unaware, negotiating is all about give and take. However, it is becoming clear that you are not able to work well with others and are nothing more than another politician dividing the country by political affiliation. Enough is enough with this government shut down! You are acting like a two year old who didn‚Äôt get his way. Meanwhile, there are American families who are wondering how they going to pay their bills and feed their children. Unfortunatlely, not all of us a rich like you Mr. Trump!
Anyone remember the ‚ÄúSecure Fences Act?‚Äù  What has changed, hmmm.
Everyone wants border security. What they don‚Äôt want is an ineffective expensive wall just to boast your ego and one that you convinced your ‚Äúsheep‚Äù, Mexico would pay for.
That right ! Stop giving are jobs to them . We would have more jobs to the people over in America that need job's . American are struggling enough . With out them coming over here and take the jobs that we need . They shot us if we came in there country !
I would like the wall to be done . Please stop the lying and get your facts right, I am starting to think otherwise on a candidate for 2020
Don‚Äôt give in.  Keep it closed.  Build the barrier
what is sad, our government stops the wall, wanting to spend the money on donations to other countries. the money comes from the taxes. take care of us first.
Democrats wanted it until Trump took office.
it must be nice to work for the gov , having a nice vacation.
Yes build the Wall build the Wall the America people are with you
We all know the answer to this.
Easy one! They are against you even if it hurts us. They only care about how things impact them politically. They couldn‚Äôt care less about Americans.
I voted for you because you said you were going to take care of business.  TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS.
Everyone is for border security Crazy Donnie.   How is money to  be spent. No blank check.
We want border security. Term limits for Congress and Senate!!!!!!! Lets go....
Amazing how some people have decided the greatest threat to our sovereignty and safety are hungry, dehydrated, exhausted families with nothing but the clothes they are wearing. But mass shootings, domestic terrorism and Russian election interference are totally fine...
So secure the border, but a wall ain't it. Stop holding America hostage for your wall, and open the govt.
Peter says the president and the other two members of Congress shall be put into a room and no one comes out until an agreement is made

It‚Äôs a cost vs benefit issue. Wall will be a wasteful boondoggle.
Yes, build the wall! We need it!! MAGA!!! Thank you President Trump 2020!!!!
Hold your ground until it is done!
Stay strong Mr President your wall will be built in Jesus name!!!!!!

I'll bet every Democrat has a fence around their homes, such hypocrits.
Steve Demarb OK, here's your compromise and solution. Have the 1.8 million DACA aka *dreamers* pay 5k each for US Citizenship. Wall gets funded, DACA's become citizens and best part? Mexican's funded the wall! (Mic drop!)
For the ones who's argument is trump said Mexico will pay for the wall don't forget you can keep your doctor you can keep your coverage
Bill Champion -respectfully, note that you chose the word I used- ‚Äúshort-sighted‚Äù...and that is def not true of those who support our President (which was the point I was making when I used the word first).  People were hugely concerned with the direction that Obama was taking our country and certain that it would get much worse with Hillary. Mexico will pay for the wall with change to the burden we see from that country if Dems will stop obstructing progress.  I don‚Äôt recall anyone saying we would negotiate with their President for a fund. I cannot fathom how people are so naive, blind, or brainwashed to not see the changes we need for U.S. security and welfare.  We must enforce law and    do what we can to keep our border from being breached.  Do we help others?  Sure...what is the best solution?  All people of the world matter...not just those who try to enter illegally.  Countries need to work to improve their standard of living..the U.S. cannot house the world.  Additionally, we have the right to guard against harm. I am amused at Trump‚Äôs character attack.  Surely, you know that the ‚Äútrained politicians‚Äù who have served are no better.  Trump was in the entertainment industry before politics...so far there is no evidence of the disgusting behavior known by Clinton, JFK, etc. while serving as POTUS. Trump is not a trained, polished politician.   Many appreciate that he is not just that smooth talking image used by a political machine.  Many appreciate the fact that he has actual knowledge, skill, and success needed to bring good change...not just a do nothing career politician.  Is he perfect..no, but he was the best choice at the time.  He has proven to be capable of leading toward good change -especially if Dems would support this country and stop obstructing progress. Those who support the Dems socialist, NWO agenda are the short-sighted and misguided base.
Vickie Jarrett Cartledge I changed my sentence above from "crazed base" to "short-sighted" base. I was addressing his crazed base, the ones that "ignore" the fact Trump said multiple times that Mexico "will pay" for the border wall. He ran for President on that platform. I will wait for the President of Mexico to say they will pay for the wall. Now, as for as not nice to mention Trumps "crazed base", its interesting his base is OK with his life-long disgusting or "unflattering" comments and actions, many of those targeting women. We deserve better.
Bill Champion ...not nice to call his base crazed...there are many people who feel the Dems are crazed...but we are all entitled to an opinion. Anyway, don‚Äôt underestimate or be short-sighted - Mexico could pay in time due to changes.  It looks like the Dems will continue to obstruct.  Amazing that the President has managed to improve the economy.  Many are thankful for the change from Obama‚Äôs NWO direction and the fact that Hillary is not POTUS.
For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.
President Trump if you feel the need to declare a state of emergency to get your money to provide security for this country because the Democrats just don't like you do what you have to do.
NO I do not want it, it is immoral and you would do better to revise the current immigration system, which by the way has allowed terrorist to fester in this country legally.
Thank you Mr. President for all you do for our country . Build the wall !
Haven't you already had 2 years to build this wall?

It‚Äôs important for the Democrats to üõë you Mr. President from fulfilling your promises so that when it‚Äôs time for re-election, Democrats can through it in your face and the rest of the USA üá∫üá∏!

YES! Stay the course Mr. President! We are behind you!
your promise was build the wall mr gorbachev and have mexico foot the tab, the way I heard it, just sayin.
Mr president  I am 72 years old and in my  opinion you are the best president in my life time  and I have your  back build the wall
Unfortunately stopping you from for filling your promises is  more important to them then national security..go president trump 2020
I support you do the job we elected you to do dont allow them to bully you or try to tear you down, continue to stand your ground America supports you!!@

Like you worked with them for the last two years? Calling them obstructionists and evil!???  Don‚Äôt expect too much from us now that you need us.
we need to call Pelosi (202)225-4965 and Chuck (202)224-6542 and leave a message "Build The Wall". We work hard for our money,first they didn't vote to give us the tax reduction and, the money they have of ours, they are wanting to help other countries with...we don't work so they can use our money to work against America!

Mr. Trump, Please ask the Democrats if they even care about their kids, grandkids or great grandkids. Because America is going to be a terrible place for them to grow up in. I am scared for my kids.
I am 100 percent behind you President Trump!!
Just tell the Dims that you are building a northern border wall for Mexico.
Build the wall Mr.President.We stand behind you.
Build the wall Mr.President.We stand behind you.
Build the Wall Mr.President you have my support!üá∫üá∏
It is no longer a wall, he wants a picket fence made of steel.
Great job Mr. President.  The Schumer and Pelosi response makes clear they do not care about our security only obstruction. Stand your ground! # MAGA #MY PRESIDENT!
Brent Congdon if the shutdown continues it could mean no wic programs for babies, no paychecks for the real disabled folks, no I.R.S. checks that I paid into the system all year, and possibly eventually could affect social security checks just to name a few. And most folks on social security are on fixed incomes.

Not opposed to building the wall but part of your promise was that Mexico would pay for it. Who will pay for it?? Us the poor. And if this shutdown continues it only hurts the poor more and more. I'm on the fence with this since you Mr. President have changed your game and plans so many times.

Show clip when they voted for the border should be secured!
The promise was Mexico was going to pay for it not us. I'm all for it, but your not fulfilling the promise.

Pinocchio continues with the hate mongering and hate.
Take the money from all the wasteful govt programs to pay for the wall. The illegals are flooding into Arizona where I live. Plus some how they're getting medical benefits when they shouldn't.
Need to cut the Pay for Congressmen, Governors Everyone in Government until they Actually DO Their JOBS.  Use their pay to Build "The Wall".
Yes we do wants border security!!!

Mr. President why can we the people of America vote on the wall instead of putting up with the stupid Democrats.
Mr. President why can we the people of America vote on the wall instead of putting up with the stupid Democrats.
Build the wall president  Trump
We haven't had a wall for over 200 years, during which time we've won two world wars, a cold war, and took over the entire planet. Why do we need a wall now?
Don't be  a fool  walls only creates  enemies  be smart and don't talk So much garbage  were tired  of hearing you  trying to brainwash  our people  Americans wake up  before is too late
Build that wall and make it tall then DEPORT THEM ALL !!!!!!
YOU ARE NOT GETTING A FUCKING WALL. PERIOD.
I am from Canada , you should see the FOOL we have for a PM if we had Trump Canada would be great again
Who‚Äôs going to pay for the wall?
A wall will not stop people from crossing our border. It may add a slight hindrance but that‚Äôs about it.
They care more about destroying you than securing the border. I'm praying for God's boldness and courage for you.

President Trump! Please go on hunger strike until the wall gets built, no matter how long it takes,  #TrumpHungerStrikeNow
It appears that the democrats are serving their own agendas and have forgotten their responsibilities as elected persons.
The only job Democrat‚Äôs want to do right now is obstruct your administration, they don‚Äôt know or care what it is they‚Äôre obstructing
I'm a furloughed employee. I say build the wall. I agree with you President Trump and will vote for u again. Your doing a great job for our country. God bless you and your family.
We got the money but law says government cannot money or tips
Have trump supporters pay for it if they want it so badly
HOW ABOUT HE OPEN UP A GO FUND ME FOR THE WALL!!!!
The white house has a fence but not the border
The Democrats  get on my last NERVES take it out of the pay they are not earning
the thing I want to know is why is it that the news said that more Citizens do not want the wall but I was not asked and none of my family was asked. I want the wall for the security of my family and friends. the border patrol can not stop everyone or everything from entering the us. the Democrats needs to stop being bull headed and compromise. I watched as they blamed Donald J. Trump. Stop blaming him for everything that goes wrong.
I want border security not just a wall across our entire border. Address the real issues with the system and Congress will work with you  It is time to compromise!
Secure the border, end illegal immigration once and for all.
The democrats aka Pelosi, Schuman most likely don‚Äôt want the Wall built, to keep the Drug Cartel and them wealthy. Remember in 2009, democrats under Obama, overturned the 1988 Ban on use of federal funds for needle-exchange program. Why do democrats want to encourage drug users to continue the deadly habits?
I agree with the wall but not the government shutdown will have a crisis here if it's not opened back up....
please president trump please build the wall!  you are using common sense!
Well Calvin Wright, I'm 75 years old and in 2 days I could figure out how to get over, under or through ANY FUCKING WALL the orange pig can build. And so could any half conscious human being.
Thank you President Trump.  God  Bless you.
Build the wall even if it  takes AMERICANS rushing the border with concrete blocks.....
#BUILDTHATWALL ... AMERICANS SUPPORT YOU.
Why don't you tell Pelosi and Schumer to kiss your a double s?
You are Always in my prayers  Mr. President.
Thank you President Trump for protecting America
I am for a beaded curtain will solve all the issues and can be fashionable at the same time
Declare a national crisis please protect the citizens of this country.  We know that they, Pelosi and Schumer, do not care about us.
Fox News (I use the term loosly) is full of bull, all surveys/polls I have seen the majority think the wall is not needed. The majority DO want border security, there are a number of options. Don't mix the two.
Do they really? How about an honest president?
Wasnt mexico paying for the wall? That was the promise.
Americans want safety and security! Yes!! We also want to live and thrive!!!! Survival and poverty are unfortunately the results of a corrupt system. Change that and your name will live on forever. Make America great!
President Trump the American people are with you. Democrats are a little slow.
Chuck Schumer Barack Obama Hillary Clinton Joe Biden Dianne Feinstein ALL voted to spend billions on a ‚ÄúSecure Fence‚Äù in 2006  Why are they opposed to one now!!!  ü§î

Kristy Rodencal Goettl my vote for the wall counters yours so your vote doesn't count. Easy to make Mexico pay out a 10% tax on all money sent to Mexico each year, as well as quite given them tax payers money each year until the Boarder is controlled.

Saige Turner yeh...research the Dems bill that funds other countries. At least keep our money here!
Joseph Siegel funny how no one mention this until he said it...but its not true...its not just free money....learn how this works before you run stupid crap from dumb ass trump
William Bieke everything you just said was wrong....learn about how that works before you listen to that idiot...go back to your coloring book
William Bieke some people are complete idiots and you can't argue with stupid
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin You keep saying the same stupid crap. You keep calling Trump a liar.... Should we go back to all the lies Obummer fed us??? "If you like your plac you can keep it".... Funny how your party was all for a wall before........... You all just hate not being in power and getting to shove your ideology down our throats.
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin he‚Äôs better than all the other manure we‚Äôve had in the last 20 years or so. And he‚Äôs doing it for free. So what the hell do you do.

Mexico is paying for the wall. USMCA trade agreement. It's not enough to complete it. Unless you voted for Trump his campaign promises are of no concern to you. You're campaign promises are in Godzillary's book currently on sale in the bargin bin at barns and noble. Stop acting like Trump owes you anything. You wasted your vote on a 2 time loser.

Saige Turner You don't have a clue do you.  Those coming across the border and working are being paid in cash which they send home to their familys.  I've seen it happen many times.  They pay NO social security.  They don't even have legal Social Security cards.  Idiot!!!
Yay, finally an intelligent American !!!  My message to Donald Trump :   ‚ÄúSure, border security !!! But that does not necessarily mean a 5 billion dollar wall !!! The Democrats also want border security ... but not the 5 billion dollar wall that you are proposing for border security !!! You need to learn how to negotiate and compromise !!! You are used to bullying until you get your own way !!! You have no respect or consideration for the other people with whom you are negotiating !!! You are 71 but you act like a child who hasn‚Äôt learned that he cannot always have his own way !!! You need to grow up !!! I hope the Democrats don‚Äôt let you get away with your bullying ways so that you may learn how to be a mature individual !!! Otherwise you need to be removed from circulation because people like you are a menace and not worthy of living in society with other people ...‚Äù
Even having the money that has been confiscated doesn't automatically allocate it to that particular budget funding. It must still be approved by congress no matter where the money comes from. Doesn't haven't to be the specific taxpayer money, how much did Obama send Iran again? Oh yeah, it was billions as well of our taxpayer money. As a government employee household of 35 years I can assure you first hand the government wastes far more than that just in idle hand-wrenching and not making a decision? Why didn't they fix this crap when they had control for so many years exactly? Do you know? They don't want to for their own agenda's and now more than ever simply because of stupid blind hate of Trump for no real actual reason any worse than anything any other president has ever done in their lifetime. Kennedy was a womanizer if that's your beef and everyone knew it, but overlooked it. Character issues, let's don't trot out all of Bill's as we just don't have that much time left in this world now do we. Please, get an actual real reason to not want better border security, a better economy for all, left and right sides, beside the lame and whimpy "I just can't stand Trump" and would rather see our country go down in flames than agree with him. How very childish.
Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.

We don't need to another 9/11! It's scary to think so many Americans have forgotten why we need protection!
We know it‚Äôs to fight you know matter what. They don‚Äôt care about Americans.
I agree build the wall it will help it will slow down illegal immigration and any immigrant that wants to take the proper action of obtaining there citizenship that's fine come on but build the wall
Keep it shut make them not take a paycheck
I understand Mr. President stated he expected Mexico to help pay for the wall and now there are those who say he flopped on a promise.  I wish those people would consider that Mexico is dealing with the caravan at this point.  This was an unforseen expense.  The wall will pay for itself.
We always with you....give a head mr president..godbless
Why is it always fox news?   If the majority of Americans want something,  more sources would say it
Here is what I would like to see: every federal employee whose pay you‚Äôre holding hostage to go on strike or walk out on their jobs.
We the people voted for this president and won! Build the wall
Absolute joke of a president...
Thank you Mr. President for all you are doing to help protect us.
We are turning against g each other because of our differing views about this wall....face it, this is gonna get worse. Already, the food stamp program will be short next month that and they have no funding for March. The Government t workers most likely are having to rely on family to help make their car and house payments. I don't know what the solution is, but we need to help our fellow Americans. The economy is gonna begin to slow. People other than Government  workers are gonna be without work due to this. People won't afford their wonderful government insurance premiums and won't be able to afford healthcare. I'm not saying the Wall is foolish. I support the Wall. But it's about to get rough America. For all of us.
Yes Americans want the wall and we love our President
Stopping you,hope they do not succeed,keep on keeping on
Stopping you,hope they do not succeed,keep on keeping on

Hey Donald it's time to impeach your ass!
Shumer and Palozi should be ashamed of themselves. Did they forget they were for boarder control .  It's because they are the ones that can't have the power to execute the boarder wall. They are to arrogant to let someone else take care of the problem

Take away their pay and see what happens
Lining their pockets with the $54 billion that they ‚Äú want for foreign aide‚Äù. Riiggghhhhtttt. Can you SPECIAL INTEREST?!
If they don't want a wall what would they like.
We need a wall. You know it and so do many others. Just the typical democrat crip crap. And tell kellyanne Conway nice job yesterday. We may be related but I doubt it.
If the elephant and the donkey are fighting only the people of America suffer I thought it was America first and not the wall first
Just do what you promised the good people of America.
If you don‚Äôt want border security your house and property should always be open and available to all strangers, at your own personal cost.

Yes Mr President, please stand strong and build the wall. I want my children and my grandchildren to be safe from these terrorists. Also I'm praying for you and your family! God bless you.
Offer the Democrats a 3 year deal on the wall- if there is no noticeable positive changes, we‚Äôll take it down.
Supplement the victims of the furlough
Stop building all these walls that they can climb over.
They stopped with Fake News, now they are telling the truth, already dictated in campaigns, it is now until 2020.

You should be ashamed of yourself. I have no idea how you sleep at night. Pathetic to use fear to control. Shame.
Out of all the president's in my lifetime I would love to shake Trump's hand.

Let the people vote on it!!
Build a base, use service folks who can not find employment when discharged, drones, that gives employment and  guards the boarder. Just saying
Legalize cannabis and build a big wall with that revenue mr. President.
Or how about getting new Democrat votes?  Illegals tend to vote that way.
I vote to build the wall!   Not only for security but also the endless benefits we pay with our tax dollars to support the ILLEGALS for years and years.  We need to make laws to fight the Boarder crisis and make our Boarder laws effective, fix DACA, and to have laws made to secure Boarder that make sense. It‚Äôs  only common sense to fix the Southern Border. It‚Äôs time to do what is right for our American citizens!
Do not give in, build the wall, we stand with you.
American want security, it's right but is not the Wall the correct way. I'm Sorry President.
Top you Mr. President fulfilling another promises
The wall is to keep you in !
Don"t back down Mr.Trump! BUILD THE WALL!!! to keep our country safe!!

Why not show what‚Äôs happening at the border now live. Show people that are clueless how bad it is.  I‚Äôm all for the wall. We need more security as a country.
How about starting with a partial bill that just covers essential workers pay.  Do not want to take out a loan to pay bills.
Mr president I want a let‚Äôs make America great again hats
Dems would still oppose Trump no matter what, blind hate is such a useless thing.
Build the wall thank you Mr president.
Nobody has ever argued against border security!! The ‚Äúwall‚Äù‚Äô extending from coast to coast that you wanted Mexico to pay for is the problem!!
Stand strong Mr. President. We are with you 100 percent.
Did you forget the Mexico is paying for it ???!!!
Israel has walls and Heaven has walls and gates too
Most of America sees the idiocy represented by the democrats. They are signing their on demise as a party in Congress
Thank you for your hard work in office.  We are proud of you.  You build, we'll pray.
I believe your "promise" was mexico will pay for your monument to yourself. #SAD
President Trump...it's all about throwing a fit so you can't help out America. So very shameful.  Keep up the great job!
Can Mexico pay 50% of the total cost? Can Mexico support the funding to help their people in the US. Can their Embassy pay for all the cost to help their people?
The promise was that Mexico was going to pay for it. Why should our taxes pay for it now? As much as I would like to see you impeached, I would much rather see you indicted after your term in office.
Do you even need to ask? Lock them up for Sedition and get on with business. Simple.
Fund it with El Chapo funds? Is that feasible?
That's it, they will block everything you try. O didn't do a single thing that was good for the country, instead he ramrodded hurtful legislation, hurting our democracy too. Thanks for not being a baby like him.
Your promise was Mexico was going to pay for it
Obviously the former - since day one ‚Äî EGO!!!!
The Democrats do not want to hear from you on anything you say!

Pay no attention to the negative comments from the false Americans they are democrats or foreigners who went back on their alegence to America
True Story !!!  The democrats are more interested in destroying you, than in what's in the best interests of our country !!!  I've never seen anything like it !!!  The democrats need to have their HEADS EXAMINED !!!
Speak the truth for once in your life and perhaps people will be willing to work with you.
My family is praying for you and your family, Mr. President.  Thank you for fighting for America and her citizens.  You will get 4 votes from my family in 2020.
Take Congress pay checks away they are paid to much and get benefits that our veterans need and deserve
I guess democrats are not American.
Kamala Harris calls the wall "a vanity project." For one to want national security at the border is now vanity in a country according to her. Americans just want immigrants to be like them, legal.

The only problem I see with the wall is making the American people pay for it why not just raise taxes on Mexican Imports since every car in America comes from there anyway maybe use that money to pay for the wall and you should paint the Mexican side camouflage so they can't see it to climb over
Why is ‚ÄúGetting rid of Trump‚Äù not one of the choices?  That‚Äôs what America wants.

We have to be with our president who want the best for us and our country do not get paid the congress no checks until they approve what you need for our protection .do what you have to do   you are the president of this country Donald Trump
Their power security is more important than our border security  to them.
Dems are never going to become moral, responsible, ethical adults.
God bless you mr President Trump And God bless America
God bless you mr President Trump And God bless America
Build the wall - the sooner the better!!
Thank you Mr President.  Build the wall!
Wait a minute what about all the known ISIS terrorist camps that are in the United States across our country. Confirmed by the FBI. Mr. President Donald Trump when you gonna do something about that and all the jihadist terrorist in our country
What‚Äôs more important to you‚Äîfulfilling a very bad promise, very weak solution, or doing the right thing for America?
Stand firm, Mr. President! We are behind you!
Build the wall with cartel money. Use all the drug money coming over the boarder. El Chap had money. Use it to build the wall!!!
Proposal of Nation wide fence ban at next meeting! Start with government buildings and elected officials homesüêÇüí©
Congress should give up their visiting protocols, security cameras, guards and chauffeurs and then say a word about the WALL...War Against Lies and Liens
Why Mexico is not paying as per your promise Mr President?
Why Mexico is not paying as per your promise Mr President?
Since we are giving Mexico Federal Aid money, can we ask them to build a wall on their side of the border with the money we give them? It would also create jobs there...
Build a wall on your northern border.
Protect the border build that wall protect America it's the only way to stop the illegals from getting in.
Take away the democrats security guards, and see how they feel. BUILD THE WALL SECURE OUR BORDERS
The internet polls I've seen reflect support for the wall by over 80 %.
Ur doing a good job mr trump keep up the work
The people did not elect Donny as President. He won the Electoral College not the popular votes.

We Want Border Security!!!! Every Nation should have borders!!!  We stand with you Mr. President!!! El Chap was arrested, use the money he had and all drug money caught coming across the border!  That way Mexico does pay for the wall! Or Tax all remittance leaving the country! We want the wall!!
Why did Democrats get time after your speech? So wrong. Schumer has been in office since ‚Äò81 and Pelosi since ‚Äò87. All they do is get rich. They self serve rather than sacrificially serve. They were undeserving of equal time. They‚Äôve had nothing but time!
If they ain't funding it, the public will...
Yes Mr. President  We want the wall
seriously. That is a negotiating tactic with Mexico. It is cost effective and will pay for itself with less people to process.
It's all about prevent Trump from succeeding. They refuse to even negotiate or offer alternate ideas for border security. But Trump is acting like a child and solely to blame for the shutdown... Dumbocrats!
behind  you president Trump stand strong praying for you
If amricans need wall but human need humanity don't be ra***
democrat's vote for wall when they knew it wouldn't be built. But they know Trump will build it and that's the facts.
Do not cave---I called all of our congressmen today. Did You??? please call your's and let them know to stand with the President
If you need an experienced Project Mananger reach out
As long as Mr. Trump works in prayer, I am sure that if it's in God's line and God had planned that it would be, surely,the wall will be built. May God's will be done.  I am praying for him(President.)  May God bless the USAüá∫üá∏
Go ahead, Mr. President, and build the wall...We're behind you 100% AND WILL STAY BEHIND YOU, no matter what the Dems do!!!
Proverbs 16:6 King James Version (KJV)  6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.
We really need to build the wall in the border.
Border security and a wall are two different things. We don't need your wall!
Border security and a wall are two different things. We don't need your wall!
Build that wall! Behind you in Indiana 100 percent!!!!
We support you Mr. President. Declare the state of emergency and let's get the wall done.
Build it. I gave money to the go fund me, use it all.
Build it. I gave money to the go fund me, use it all.
Stand your ground. We need border security
If Democrats would work with President Trump, they would gain a lot of respect.....
Stay strong Mr. President! You have my support!
President Trump we need border security, thank you for sticking to your promises.
Here's a thought. Imagine you live in a new place. Imagine how beautiful your life is you have wonderful neighbors. The birds are chirping the sun is shinning. You go into your house and you find out on the news there has been a catastrophe. Now remember you live inside the wall. The president comes on and says he will implement Marshall law. Now depending on what the situation you may be required to stay in your home. If you try to go out lethal forced my be used. Now you have rights but at this time you are under marshal law. You have no food and your water has stopped. You can't go out to find out what is wrong or ask for help. 911 is off and the president is only telling you what you want to hear about the situation. Your children need food water and medical and you are confined to your home. Oh and for fun we will take away the right to bare arms also. You go out to get help because you have no other choice, you need help for you and your loved ones, you are killed or better yet taken into custody. Or you want to leave the U.S. because everyone is sick or you don't even know what is going on. Now after that thought I have to ask myself which side of the wall do I want to be on? I know its frustrating wanting to keep people out but I don't see people wondering about the possibility of having to stay inside the wall. Look up the definition of a reservation check your history fact before you decide if you want to live on a reservation too.
Just like drill baby drill impacted oil prices, build baby build.
We the American majority want our borders secured and will hold in blame to every democrook who stands in the way of the building of the wall when American blood is spilled. It is no different from when a drunk driver kills an innocent person and is charged with manslaughter. Every democrook who stands in the way of the building of the wall and the security of the southern border will result in catastrophy and are therefore just as cupable in the downfall of this nation.

It doesnt matter if your wall is of iron or concret, while you continue supporting coruption governments in some countries of C. A. Especially Honduras the people will continue leaving their countries. All the walls have been fallen.

I think you should finish your promise to drain the swamp first. Drain the swamp in all states. Then you won‚Äôt have any resistance.
Stand firm sir, we must have the Wall.
They just wanna go opposite what ever Republicans wants. Even knowing that will hurt American citizens, I am so confused. Why they have to do this ?
