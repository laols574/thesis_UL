"An anguished question from a Trump supporter: "Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid?" The serious answer: Here‚Äôs what we really think about Trump supporters - the rich, the poor, the malignant and the innocently well-meaning, the ones who think and the ones who don't... That when you saw a man who had owned a fraudulent University, intent on scamming poor people, you thought "Fine." That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, "Okay." That when you heard him proudly brag about his own history of sexual abuse, you said, "No problem." That when he made up stories about seeing muslim-Americans in the thousands cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center, you said, "Not an issue." That when you saw him brag that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue and you wouldn't care, you chirped, "He sure knows me." That when you heard him illustrate his own character by telling that cute story about the elderly guest bleeding on the floor at his country club, the story about how he turned his back and how it was all an imposition on him, you said, "That's cool!" That when you saw him mock the disabled, you thought it was the funniest thing you ever saw. That when you heard him brag that he doesn't read books, you said, "Well, who has time?" That when the Central Park Five were compensated as innocent men convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and he angrily said that they should still be in prison, you said, "That makes sense." That when you heard him tell his supporters to beat up protesters and that he would hire attorneys, you thought, "Yes!" That when you heard him tell one rally to confiscate a man's coat before throwing him out into the freezing cold, you said, "What a great guy!" That you have watched the parade of neo-Nazis and white supremacists with whom he curries favor, while refusing to condemn outright Nazis, and you have said, "Thumbs up!" That you hear him unable to talk to foreign dignitaries without insulting their countries and demanding that they praise his electoral win, you said, "That's the way I want my President to be." That you have watched him remove expertise from all layers of government in favor of people who make money off of eliminating protections in the industries they're supposed to be regulating and you have said, "What a genius!" That you have heard him continue to profit from his businesses, in part by leveraging his position as President, to the point of overcharging the Secret Service for space in the properties he owns, and you have said, "That's smart!" That you have heard him say that it was difficult to help Puerto Rico because it was the middle of water and you have said, "That makes sense." That you have seen him start fights with every country from Canada to New Zealand while praising Russia and quote, "falling in love" with the dictator of North Korea, and you have said, "That's statesmanship!" That Trump separated children from their families and put them in cages, managed to lose track of 1500 kids. has opened a tent city incarceration camp in the desert in Texas - he explains that they‚Äôre just ‚Äúanimals‚Äù - and you say, ‚Äúwell, ok then.‚Äù That you have witnessed all the thousand and one other manifestations of corruption and low moral character and outright animalistic rudeness and contempt for you, the working American voter, and you still show up grinning and wearing your MAGA hats and threatening to beat up anybody who says otherwise. What you don't get, Trump supporters in 2019, is that succumbing to frustration and thinking of you as stupid may be wrong and unhelpful, but it's also...hear me...charitable. Because if you're NOT stupid, we must turn to other explanations, and most of them are less flattering." ~ A friend of a friend of a friend, perfectly expressing my thoughts on this.
"And it is not just $5 Billion... that's a downpayment for this little vanity project. The best estimate seems to be roughly $23 Billion. Which would be really nice going into education, healthcare, housing and/or FEMA about now."

"Borders" a.k.a the Mexican border.  Because there are so many Mexicans committing atrocious acts like mass shootings every other week *cough* that's all you white folks *cough*, illegal Mexicans don't even contribute to 1% of the total crime in the US, that 99% is done by Americans. Soooo why the need for a border wall??
"Commander And Chief Of The Armed Forces"....I would definitely say it's about defending our Nation!
"Defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty" YEAH RIGHT  Except you dodged the draft so you couldn't defend your fellow americans in Vietnam.  Except you conspired with Russian agents to fix an american election.  Except you shut down the government, leaving airport security understaffed and cancelling safe-food inspections.  What is it you are protecting again? Other than your own tax returns and your criminal family?
"Donald Trump asked Cohen to lie about the Trump Tower Moscow deal, then he assertively and repeatedly lied about it to the American people.   And Mueller has documentation proving it."

"Donna Brazile admits stealing debate questions for Hillary, but blames the Russians By Thomas Lifson I give Donna Brazile just a few points for finally fessing up (after lying and denying) that she stole and supplied CNN debate questions to Hillary Clinton, helping the establishment candidate triumph over insurgent Bernie Sanders.  But I have to deduct even more points, because she did so in a context of blaming the Russians and partially exonerating herself. The expression ‚Äúnon-denial denial‚Äù has a cognate in her non-apology apology."

"I" am VERY happy with the job the President has done so far, but REALLY feel "the wall" decision is  a "BAD ONE"...! Hopefully, He knows what He is doing...as "HE" will have to answer for it,,,!!

"If we don‚Äôt defend our Constitution, then we cease to be a nation. I suck big league!"~Donnie J. Rump~

"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor".    We currently have a potus who lies way more than he tells the truth, this is a new experience.
"Indeed, what the Democrats and Mueller's team seem to be saying is that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election by hacking into the emails of John Podesta and the DNC to reveal how they were interfering in the 2016 elections.  And they forget how former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz tipped the scales for Hillary Clinton over a surging Bernie Sanders.  She interfered in the 2016 election in ways Vladimir Putin couldn't even dream of and arguably changed at least the Democratic Party results and campaign timeline."
"Let our lord now command your servants, who is skillful in playing the lyre, and when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well(1Samuel 16:16)".  This comes in two ; the first is, God can use unfavorable situation someone is in, for you to showcase your God-given talent and thus be blessed. The second is, God brings down one and lifts up another. Nothing just happens! Whatever happens in life whether favorable or unfavorable is for God to take glory for Himself.   Don't get this wrong though, there are times one suffers for rejecting God and not serving Him but that's not what we are treating today. The case of Saul and David is different. God just appointed a new king and He wants to bring him to the palace to learn till he is fully in charge, and He is punishing Saul for what he did and at the same time using his predicament to show David to the entire nation. Bringing him to the limelight to be noticed.   There is a God in the heavens who works wonders. What should be prioritized in your life is to be faithful and committed to serving God. You must keep hope alive as you serve Him faithfully till God takes glory for Himself out of the situation you are in. You must position yourself for greatness and not waver in faith.  When God made Saul a king, he thought, he could do what pleased him alone and not what pleased God. He has forgotten that, He who made you king could also remove you. Not only was he removed, he was severely dealt with, the first and once a great king ran mad. A great lesson to all who occupy great positions but are pleasing themselves, those who are forgetting so soon how God made them what they are, and lift them up.   You can run away from the judgment of man but cannot run from the judgment of God. Twenty, thirty years may be long to you but nemesis will catch up with you. Repentance is what can save you. Repent! JESUS IS COMING SOON!
"Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work."
"Negotiate"...Reopen the government and then 'negotiate'. That is exactly what the Democrats want. You really think they will 'negotiate' once the government is open. SMH They could careless about Americans security. It is all about power and greed to them.  "America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves."

"The time has come to acknowledge spiritual realities: The devil is using the Democratic Party to try to destroy America. If we don‚Äôt awaken, our children will soon awaken in a nation unrecognizable to us today."
"There is no migrant crisis.  "There is, however, a refugee crisis. That crisis is the effect of at least a half-century (and, arguably, twice that) of calamitous US political intervention in Central America, and not ‚Äî as President Trump would have us believe ‚Äî the inevitable byproduct of 'bad hombres' who may as well be 'animals.'  "US-funded military coups, resource exploitation, and American policies of economic neoliberalism in El Salvador have destabilized the entire region, and effectively created a climate where paramilitary-aligned drug cartels can thrive."
"There is nothing manufactured about children arriving at our borders dehydrated and sick. There is nothing manufactured about migrants being exploited and abused by human traffickers. There is nothing manufactured about lethal drugs pouring across our border." ~Sec Nielson WOW
"We cease to be a nation" ?????????  WTF??
"We don't have a country without a border" President Donald J. Trump
"What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."

#GoodFencesMakeGoodNeighbors  Saw a post yesterday and can't find it but it really made sense. Something like this-  We all have our homes and lives we are responsible for in general. You try to be good neighbors and good citizens, but in general- you're responsible for your own homes yards and families. And while you care about your neighbors, do what you can to be a good hospitable neighbor, and care what happens on the other side of the fence- you're ultimately not responsible for their yard bills problems or livelihoods. You're responsible for what goes on within the perimeter of your own home, your people, and living space- as does America as a whole. So what happened to that concept on a broader spectrum? Where is the leadership in Guatemala El Salvador Mexico etc? What happened to them taking responsibility for the care and well-being of their own citizens as the United States of America does theirs? Does a portion of other countries hard earned paychecks go to support the American people ever? NOPE- NEVER- But it's always the other way around, America manages to take care of their own and still be the most generous Nation on Earth.  So If other nations can't at the least manage take care of their own citizens, By No Fault But Their Own Fault, what makes them think that the American people have the resources to take care of the entire third world's failures they brought upon themselves ???????? It's Not Sustainable- Period.

#masege to p.tramp A message of distress from the people of Basra province to the President of the United States of America. Trump respectable.  We are the people of Basra province. We ask you to rescue our province of Basra from the Militias  Gangs who have been stealing the oil of Basrah since 2003 and to this day, they are sending it to Iran and to the terrorist organizations that fund them with weapons. We have been carrying out large demonstrations against these gangs, but they respond to us with repression, torture, murder and assassination. We lack the simplest means of living, such as water and electricity. We demand reforms and appointments for the unemployed youth, many of them graduates and holders of higher diplomas, but the armed groups monopolize appointments for themselves and their parties and gangs. They are killing all those who speak a word and stand against them and they take the presidential palaces in the province of Basra, a place known to the Iraqis, and in the recent demonstrations have fired live bullets at the demonstrators and killed many innocent young people who claim their right, and the assassination of civilian activists In front of their homes and in the streets and markets, We are asking your presence to intervene quickly to rescue us from these dirty armed gangs. We know that the US military has entered Iraq and we welcome this very welcome because we believe that the US military has the ability to rescue Basra, Iraq and Iraqis from these gangs. We hope you will receive this message and respond. Because you are the only hope now for all Iraqis. Thank you Mr. Trump. Youth of Basrah Governorate...........

1 of 1 stories  Poll: Trump Approval Down, Slips With Base  by Domenico Montanaro  January 17, 2019 | 3 min 36 sec  Ôøº Share  Ôøº Listen Now  Ôøº Playlist  Ôøº  Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images  Ôøº Enlarge for caption  While the longest government shutdown in U.S. history continues, President Trump's approval rating is down, and there are cracks showing with his base. A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds Trump's approval rating down and his disapproval rating up from a month ago. He currently stands at 39 percent approve, 53 disapprove ‚Äî a 7-point net change from December when his rating was 42 percent approve, 49 percent disapprove. And the movement has come from within key portions of his base. He is:  Down significantly among suburban men, a net-positive approval rating of 51-to-39 percent to a net-negative of 42 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove. That's a net change of down 18 percentage points;  Down a net of 13 points among white evangelicals, from 73-to-17 percent approve to 66-to-23 percent approve;  Down a net of 10 points among Republicans, from 90-to-7 percent approve to 83-to-10 percent;  Down marginally among white men without a college degree, from 56-to-34 percent approve to 50-to-35 percent approve, a net change downward of 7 points.  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. "For the first time, we saw a fairly consistent pattern of having his base showing evidence of a cracking," said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll. "Don't know if that's temporary ‚Äî tied to the government shutdown ‚Äî or a broader problem the president is having." The percentage of people now saying they strongly disapprove of the job the president's doing is up to 45 percent, the highest for President Trump since December 2017. Don't see the graphic above? Click here. 2020 headwinds The president also faces some significant headwinds for re-election in 2020. Just 30 percent of registered voters said they will definitely vote for Trump in 2020, while 57 percent said they will definitely vote against him. Just 76 percent of Trump supporters, 69 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of white evangelicals say they will definitely vote for him. Many, if not most, of them will likely vote for the president, but their softness in supporting him for re-election is a sign of vulnerability. For context, in 2010, when asked about then-President Barack Obama, just 36 percent said they would definitely vote for him, while 48 percent said they would not. Obama went on to win with 51 percent of the vote. But for Trump to have more than half the country already saying it definitely won't vote for him indicates he is facing a difficult re-election. "The president has had his base and not much else," Miringoff said, "and when you look ahead to the election ... he enters with a significant disadvantage. His re-election prospects would definitely be in jeopardy at this point." Trump has a lot of work to do to be able to reassemble the coalition that voted for him narrowly to win in the Electoral College in 2016. He lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes and won just 46 percent of the vote. He won by about 70,000 votes combined between Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, all states that have trended away from the president during his first two years in office. The Democratic field As for who Trump would face, former Vice President Joe Biden stands apart from the Democratic field, in terms of how Democratic voters feel about him compared to others. Biden is the best-known potential Democratic candidate, and is very well liked ‚Äî 76 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have a favorable impression of him. Just 12 percent have a negative view. "If he gets in, he automatically becomes the front runner with numbers like this," Miringoff said. "He becomes the candidate who you have to get into the mix with and be competitive with him." Barbara Carvalho, director of the poll, added, "It is unusual to see a candidate, who's been part of the Washington scene for so long, have such a low unfavorable rating." Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Bernie Sanders, the principal challenger to 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton, is well-known, but between 1-in-3 and 1-in-4 Democrats have a negative opinion of him. There are a lot of questions about whether Sanders will be able to keep his base of activist supporters together, four years later, now that Democrats have so many more options. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has an almost equally high favorability rating as Sanders, but is not viewed as negatively. Others are potentially well-positioned, too. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and California Sen. Kamala Harris are in a next tier and have a capability of taking off if they make a good impression as voters get to know them. The poll isn't good news for all potential Democratic contenders, however. The Democratic primary electorate does not appear ready for a billionaire. As former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg weighs a run, Democrats are evenly split on their views of him, while about half of them haven't yet formed an opinion. A primary challenge to Trump? There has been talk of a primary challenge to President Trump, but no candidate emerges with particular backing. Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Mitt Romney are viewed more unfavorably than favorably with Republicans and Republican-leaning independents ‚Äî 24 percent view Kasich favorably, 28 percent view him unfavorably; 29 percent view Romney positively, while 48 percent view Romney negatively. Romney has been an outspoken critic of Trump, and the GOP base does not appear to appreciate that. "There is no strong support" for a primary challenge to Trump, Miringoff said. "Kasich is not well-known, and Romney is not particularly popular." In the mood for compromise As this shutdown continues, 59 percent said they mostly blame President Trump or congressional Republicans for it. And more than 6-in-10 are in the mood for compromise ‚Äî 63 percent said they want their elected officials to compromise with people they disagree with rather than stick to their positions, including a majority of Republicans. Just 31 percent overall said they want their elected officials to stick to their positions no matter what. Strong Republicans (50 percent), African-Americans (51 percent), Trump supporters (53 percent), Latinos (55 percent) and Gen Xers (56 percent) are among the least likely to say they want their elected officials to compromise. "People are looking for compromise right now," Miringoff said. But neither side is seen as doing a very good job of it right now ‚Äì 57 percent think the Trump administration is doing too little to work with Democrats in Congress; 55 percent think that Democrats are doing too little to work with the administration. Neither party is making a very good impression, either. Only about a third of Americans have a positive view of congressional Democrats (34 percent) while a majority (53 percent) disapprove of the job they are doing. An even lower number (29 percent) have a positive view of congressional Republicans and more view them negative (58 percent). The survey of 1,023 adults was conducted from Jan. 10 to Jan. 13 by The Marist Poll for NPR and the PBS NewsHour. Results for all Americans have a margin of error of +/- 3.8 percentage points. There were 324 Republicans or Republican-leaning independents surveyed. Where they are referenced, there is a margin of error of +/- 6.8 percentage points. There were 417 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents surveyed. Where they are referenced, there is a margin of error of +/- 6 percentage points.
1) just because my offered solution doesnt meet your criteria doesnt inheritly mean I want nothing done. Stop thinking in extremes. You either agree or dont. Either is fine.  2) Seems like the Democrats are trying to meet the president half way which has proven to be fruitless at the expense of Federal worker furloughs.  3) ...I thought Mexico was going to pay for it?
1. Cut taxes.  2. (Try) to repeal ACA  3. Shutdown over national security  Soooo, if you know how to count, we see that security comes after money.  Security is his 3rd priority.  Please, tell me how counting is fake news or a liberal conspiracy...  Sad thing is I can break it down to literally 3 steps, hold your hand through it, and you still will refuse to grasp the painfully obvious and mathematically proven point!
1. Literally no one is advocating an open border policy. 2. I assume you've never been to the EU.

A Trump government shutdown should NEVER be used as a negotiation.
A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
A black man in Oakland sued one of the biggest corporate in America. They are called Monsanto. Monsanto is a chemical facility plant industrial that synthesized chemicals to spray our crops. Its poisonous and it causes cancer. Early 2017. A man was diagnose with cancer. Doctors gave him 3 months to live. He was a school ground keeper. One of his job requirements was to kill the weeds off by using weed killer. Which Monsanto produces. With science knowledge and prove. Points out it was the weed killer it self that gave that man cancer. He won. One of the biggest law sue in history. Now we are finding out that Monsanto ingredients is in our cereal, oatmeal and another foods we buy in the grocery stores.   In 2009, Obama first term of Presidency. He selected the vice President of Monsanto to be head of the F.D.A.   Obama was also a huge supporter of none labeling Monsanto ingredients on our food. That also passed. Now you ever wonder why we have an cancer epidemic ever in history? Or why they so invested on to passing universal healthcare?   Never have government have full control of our healthcare system.  It's called a death panel.
A black man voting for Trump is like a virgin voting for rape.
A careless and arrogant president.  #iwayanwilantara
A chump President for a chump type of America
A con man who is staging a fight for a wall he does not believe in himself, if so it would have been done 2 years ago......He will go down in history as the con man who put on a false fight to keep the government shut down to protect himself .  If he did not lie to his base and feel embarrassed by getting caught in his own lies this would not happen.  Democrats took the house with no wall or a caravan
A country without borders cannot stand.  Keep the dollars in and pesos out!
A country without borders is no country.  A homeowner without a locked door is what? A future victim.
A false man that you are not defending your borders but crossed your borders for your ambitions, lover of moneyüñïüñïüñïüñï
A federal government who operates a catch and release program for illegals does not have the moral high ground to go after sanctuary cities.
A furlough of more than 30 calendar days, or of more than 22 discontinuous work days, is also a RIF action. https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/workforce-restructuring/reductions-in-force/

A great negotiator would not need to hold over one million Americans hostage, causing them financial anxiety and pain in order to ‚Äúnegotiate.‚Äù  If that is the best approach to ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù you have, you are certainly NOT even a good negotiator, let alone a great negotiator.  You told us your ‚Äústrategy‚Äù in your book The Art of the Deal: ‚ÄúI play to people‚Äôs fantasies.‚Äù  Grow up. Stop hurting our fellow citizens to get your way.  Open the government - NOW....  Then start genuine open give and take negotiations in Congress to ID smart and effective enhancements to our border security, coupled with permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship for the DACA folk......  It is terrible for you to be hurting over one million Americans as part of your ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù strategy.  No wait, it is worse that terrible. It is IMMORAL
A hundred miles of 30-50 feet high steel. Will stop illegals 100% more often then an open valley with a drone or camera. THE WALL IS COMING #Trump2020  #Buildthewall
A joke
A little Photoshop goes a long way.
A lot of you are absolutely delusional.
A man that stands for the principle of America great president
A nation without borders...is no nation at all.
A nuclear capable country without strong borders? Build the wall ;)
A quick civics lesson: 'Just before the government shutdown began, the Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (a Republican) overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill that would have kept the government open. The then-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (a Republican) refused to allow the House to even vote on that bill knowing it would likely pass with a veto-proof majority. For those who might not know, if a president vetoes a bill, if two-thirds of both the House and the Senate vote against that president‚Äôs veto, they can override it, thus enacting that bill. That‚Äôs called ‚Äúchecks and balances,‚Äù a key component our Founding Fathers put into our Constitution. Fast forward a few weeks to when Democrats took power in the House of Representatives. They passed essentially the same exact veto-proof bill the Senate had overwhelmingly approved just a couple of weeks earlier that would reopen the government. Only now, the same Sen. McConnell who let the passage of that bill before, won‚Äôt allow the Senate to vote on it ‚Äî because he knows it would pass, thus forcing Trump to veto it, which would embarrass the party and expose their incompetence. Keep in mind, this all centers around a lie Trump repeatedly told during his campaign (and even now) that Mexico was going to pay for his stupid wall, a wall he now wants the American taxpayer to fund. Republicans controlled all of Congress and the White House for the past two years. If funding this wall was such a major issue, they would have done it ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt. Repeatedly, his own party refused to pass spending bills that gave Trump money for that pointless wall. This isn‚Äôt about border security, no matter how many time Trump tells that lie. This is about his ego and his pathetic attempt to distract people from the constantly-growing list of scandals, legal troubles, and embarrassing administration departures he‚Äôs been dealing with over the last several weeks. If our government was functioning how our Founding Fathers meant for it to, our government would have never shut down. First it was a Republican, Paul Ryan, refusing to let the House vote on the bill the Senate passed. Now it‚Äôs hypocritical Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican, doing the same thing with the recently-passed House bill. Two frauds who refused to allow a bill to be voted on to keep the government open/reopen it, not because they opposed it, but because they were afraid it would pass and embarrass their party‚Äôs ‚Äúpresident.‚Äù This is not how democracy works. This is not how our government is supposed to work. Donald Trump and the GOP are the only ones to blame for this political stunt.'
A real leader. It's been so long
A real leader... unlike the anti British parasites we have now in the U.K.... wish we had him..
A total  Madman needs to be gone
A wall doesn't fix the problem.  We don't have open borders. in fact our borders are more closed than most, with some of the highest costs and hardest requurements to immigrate legally. Those that would try to cross the border illegally are typically stopped and turned back. Most illegal immigrants had work visa's and overstay, and usually arrive in airports. A wall doesn't fix the problem. Its just grand-standing.
A wall is to save our sovereign state from foreign countries  or terrorist.   Dumbass
A wall won't fix your divided nation.
A wall won't make a difference trust me drugs and people will still get in!!  The only problem it will cost double the money so if anyone has bad habits expect to pay more for your drugs!!
A wall would make it harder to get in But are you hiring
A wall, vetting and one voter identification card along with a census and immediate deportation is necessary
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT SIR
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!!
ABSOLUTELY... BUILD THE BORDER WALL NOW.

We came here and the native Americans fed, clothed, and helped us survive the beginning of this great nation. So obviously we killed them drove them away and took their land for ourselves. If they don't approve the wall, it's going to happen again, except this time, we'll be the native Americans. I may be wrong but I doubt it.
Absolutely, Mr. President! Thank you for standing up against the Washington Party!
Absolutely, wall pls and thank you!
Absolutely.    Declare State of Emergancy and get our Wall built !!!  Get this crap over with. That‚Äôll Shut Down Pissy Palosi and Commi Chuck.
Absolutely. This is the lifeblood of our nation: SECURITY.
According to Donald Trump  , If I say it people believe it.
According to Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), 251,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011 and April 30, 2018, according to DHS status indicators. These criminal aliens were charged with MORE THAN 663,000 criminal offenses.  Just in TEXAS ALONE:  > 1,351 homicides;  > 7,156 sexual assaults;  > 9,938 weapons charges;  > 79,049 assaults;  > 18,685 burglaries;  > 79,900 drug charges;  > 815 kidnappings;  > 44,882 thefts;  > 4,292 robberies  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/departments-justice-and-homeland-security-release-quarterly-alien-incarceration-report  Anyone who opposes the wall is giving warrant and sanction to mass murder, rape, violent crime and human trafficking - and there is just no way for them to spin themselves out of it.
According to Trump, we are not a nation from 1787 to 1994. What a maroon. It's astounding just how dumb the things Trump can allude to simply to vomit out his rhetoric.
According to the Constitution, that is absolutely right.

Actually the fact that you are in cahoots with Russia is a little more concerning than your signatory fence
Actually to protect the constitution...
Actually you are a illegal immigrant from Europe and this land was mexico for thousands of years and mexicans lived here for thousands of years and are native to this land so this land belongs to mexicans more than anyone else. All white people are illegal immigrants from Europe that came here for spiritual refuge and we are all illegal immigrants living here on mexico's land that we stole from them, all mexicans deserve to live here more than anyone else. We should let in all mexicans at the border and build them freedom towers in san diego where they all can live and eat free with buffets of maha prasadam not fast food so they eat as healthy as possible to prevent diseases. We should be focused on the welfare of the immigrants not using our borders as way to keep immigrants out that want to live here, all non violent immigrants at the border should be let in and put on welfare and the fact you want to keep them out to cut their welfare money is a crime.
Actually, tax cuts for rich people, deregulating Industry, developing wildlife preserves, and massively increased spending in the arms industry were your first priorities. Among others.  You waited until we elected Democrats to stop this nonsense to decide a wall was your priority. Your goal is to divide us more than get anything else done.
Adam Kowalski It can‚Äôt be done!  You can‚Äôt indite a sitting President!  You can‚Äôt just destroy laws passed by Congress, unless they are replaced with new laws passed by Congress!  You can‚Äôt even impeach Him in The House with out an impeachable offense, and we have The Senate!
Adam Smith Another big mouthed DIM
Adam Smith yes, you sure as hell are not AMERICAN, STAY IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY WHEREVER THAT IS!
Addy Means , not true, there are a few Dem Senators that are donating their pay while the shutdown continues..... I support Trump 100%,  and just like there are some Republicans that need to go, there are some good Dem's, unfortunately Pelosi and Schumer are NOT!
Addy Means Elizabeth Warren gave hers up! To a refugee/ asylum seeker foundation but she did give it up. SMH Right after she said Trump's shut down is keeping 800,000 Americans from being paid so I am donating my paycheck to illegals! OK how does that help Americans not getting paid??  They have lost their minds, or they have never really been heard before.
Addy Means how are Dems greedy when the Republicans are the ones that are trying to give rich people tax breaks and you're only believe in helping yourselves where as Democrats are trying to help everybody Republicans believe in self-preservation they don't care about anybody else y'all are the greedy ones
Adonus Lloyd I‚Äôm not worried about it. If they wanna get our guns let them there are over 5million Americans with guns who would laugh at them trying to get them. No one is going to put them down I say about out of the 5 million maybe 100 thousand would disarm them selves that‚Äôs about it.
Adonus Lloyd define assault weapons.
After honoring God, the security of our nation must be our first priority. What does it matter if we have health insurance if we are under attack?  What does it matter how good our schools are if our children are not safe? What does it matter what minimum wage is if our country is going broke from supporting illegals?  What does it matter if we protect the environment if we don't protect our people?  The people and "leaders" of this nation must understand that defending our nation must come before all other issues - that all issues become meaningless without  a strong military and secure borders.  Honor God, Protect our Borders, then everything else can be addressed.
After we do build that wall next will be term LIMITS. Poor Nancy and Charlie will have to get a job. Not steal from real Americans.
Against  an  imaginary  enemy?
Agnes Salgado you think it come to be this way in the last 2 years?? Well you haven't watched long enough. I actually live here, and it's only become better since 45 took over. So stay on the outside and shut up. Puro Pinche Puta.

Agolf Twitler is a Russian asset and Giuliani all but admitted it...
Agree
Agree   Build the wall !!
Agree  100%!
Agree 100%.we need the wall.
Agree but  the other side has no common sense  Mr President they want to ruin our nation something else has to be done about them
Agree need wall, but don't keep punishing the working class to get it.  If shutdown keeps going, the next thing we'll face is a major Recession.   No money to pay bills, let alone buy anything or even go out to eat.  Use your executive order and end the shutdown
Agree with border security! Since they are against a physical wall, why don‚Äôt we try invisible electrical partition? Like those in sci-fi movies?
Agree!
Agree! Please secure!!! Don‚Äôt give in!
Agree, it's time too take action as the democrats are out of their minds!
Agree, we also need to pull out of the Middle East. It appears Isreal has been arming Hilary‚Äôs creation ISIS. We don‚Äôt know who we are fighting over there, not worth shedding any more blood of our children for oil and other nations regional ambitions.
Agree. This shows he is a great leader.
Agreed
Agreed Mr President.
Agreed Mr. President.  When we as Americans want to travel internationally we adhere to the laws; we get our vaccines, passports etc.  if we don‚Äôt, then they have the right to detain us.  Period.  I‚Äôm not sure why Democrat‚Äôs like to pretend that this is not how the civil world works...
Agreed!
Agreed!  Keep fighting President Trump!
Agreed! Don‚Äôt back down!!!
Agreed! Don‚Äôt give up the fight!
Agreed!!!
Agreed!!! We'd like the infringement on our 2nd Amendment Rights day after day to go away also!!!
Agreed.
Agreed.  The only problem is it should have been done 30 years ago.  Whether we want to admit it not,  our nation hasn't existed for a long long while.
Agreed. Hold the line.
Agreed. Why do people have walls and locks in their houses ? This country is American home. It should be protected
Ah thanks for the laugh donnie !! You are truly the best American drama queen on tv !!
Airbags and walls protect...TRUMP 2020!üëçüá∫üá∏

All CODEL Postponed....  This is a Great Opportunity for Mrs. Pelosi and President Trump and other's to get together and take care of the situation at hand in regards to the 800, 000 American Citizens and our Security at Our Border.  Get to the compramize of getting our government reopen and give our border Agent's what they need to do their job.   Country Before Party! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
All I see is a fellow American who loves his country and votes for the man who will make it great again.
All I'm going to say is El Chapo smugglers said they don't get drugs in this country the illegal way... They drive straight through... Every body keep saying the wall will make us safe, keep drugs out this that or another, but if a person wants to get drugs into the country or they just want to come to the country they will find a way... Far as the drugs go, the drug of choice now that such a crisis is opioids and those come right from the doctor... Weed is damn near legal almost every way, and crack has always been around... Now make us safer naw I don't by that because illegal immigrants aren't doing majority of the killing and other crimes... But if you think having a wall will make you safe that's your opinion, but ask all the mass shootings victims family would a wall have made a difference for them...
All Vile Lib Dem socialist Communists Who Hate Capitalism Freedom and America Feel The Defense of 12 Million Gang Members Millions of Child Molesters PEDOPHILES ROBBERS ILLEGALS RAPISTS KILLERS and Shariah Islam Tists who Kill Gays Transgenders Lesbians their own daughters wives and all women who disobey Maxine Waters BELOVED Shariah Law IS THIER HIGHEST AND MOST IMPORTANT DUTY.

All of you blindly supporting Trump are not realizing all those affected (or don‚Äôt care) by this government shutdown. And it really shows.    And you won‚Äôt notice until each one of you are directly affected. You‚Äôre all acting like children calling those who disagree with you ‚Äúsnowflakes‚Äù  Grow up and do your homework. Stop watching the news.
All the drug lords in Mexico support Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. El Chapo, El Nacho El Teo, El General, and El Mayo are against border security.üòõ

Republicans want STRONG BORDERS and NO CRIME. ~The White House
Alright enough I agree with the wall but that's a little dramatic
Altered photo fake black supporters.
Althought when Rep had both the majority in the House and in Senate, it requires 61/100 approving votes to pass a bill to fund the wall in the Senate, (which did not happened.) So no, he still couldn't do anything without Dems support. But I'm sure you knew that, right?
Alvin Mathews can you say collusion # he is guilty #he loves Putin

Amazing the amount of concern Pelosi has for the ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù of congress! So much so that she wishes to postpone the SOTU address by our POTUS...She has ZERO concern  for the security of our nation and will not fund a border wall to keep out those who are not vetted and want to sneak into our country to commit heinous crimes against our citizens! She is a sorry excuse for a human being!
Amem. Build the Wall & PUT YOUR NAME ON IT. THINK THAT WOULD  REALLY TICK PALOSE OFF?

America coude do much better it coude be a country of biggest oportunities its nation coude do much better but America has been supporting to everyone around to millions of emigrants and many of them came to US just to live on peoples taxes Trump is the one who wants to stop this ! all he wants is to see his country grate !
America does not have a wall in time to chase dangerous criminals to successfully carry out illegal illegal drug dealing, there is a wall of criminals running out of business, we will commit this. finding every way into America, sabotaging America in the next time the LORD will bless America especially for President DONALD J, TRUMP will always be safe .
America doesn't have open borders either. BTW the UK doesn't have a wall. Neither do many European countries. Canada doesn't have one but they are considering because of the influx of Americans running away from America.
America first
America first!!!
America isnt as great as yall think. That's why illegal immigration is at a 46 year low. Maybe we should focus on literally all of the other issues with our country üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
America needs to stand United to be strong and safe. The Dems have created one plan after another to divide and conquer us. The more we fight with each other over things that they have brought up or to attention, the less we are United. Our laws need to be plainly defined and strictly enforced. Corrupt  officials, law enforcement, etc, should be held accountable at the highest punishment bc they have no respect for the very laws they swore to uphold. People should fear the consequences of crime. Our nation should promote safety and peace due all those who uphold the laws that keep it that way.
America safety at risk ! Need Trump Conservative Common Sense !
America will not be America anymore...after 2024...
American badass and my hero rock on MrTrump!!!
Americans are just mad because he doesn't bomb other countries as much.
Americans are loved all around the world especially in Vietnam. The entire country knows the truth!
Americans are loved around the world!!! Stand strong and keep turning around the country. No excuses as Trump is a real estate developer. Most of fixing a country rests in its infrastructure. No better person to fix the issues and to secure the border.
Americans are so lucky to have a real leader! In the meantime in Canada it‚Äôs all the opposite!
Americans should pay a visit to the homes of Pelosi or other Democrats in the Congress. Find out whether their homes have no walls. Ask them why they have walls all over. Ask them whether they would welcome and accept every Tom, Dick and Harry. I have never seen a Party so averse to issues of National Importance. What are the Democrats up to?

Amren Dugan  Typical Hillary follower.
Amy Lynn says the dumb white bitch.
And ... I,m glad it is ... no one seems to know ..what the democrats highest and most important duty is ...I,m pretty sure it,s about taking something from you .. not doing anything for you ...
And 4 Americans were killed because he said that. ISIS was sending trump a message that they are not defeated! Trump wont listen to the people he should be listening too. Mattis tried to tell him and trump thinks he knows more than the Generals. NOT ! Trump thinks he knows more about everything than anyone. Typical Narcissist!
And I bet business is really good right now because people have lots of money because our president that's right your President Trump is a bitch ass freaking president brought us back from the brink of Democrat spoil!!!!
And The Left are Truly Destroying The USA!

And again, NO IDEA ON WHAT HE'S DOING.
And all true americans stand with you.  Defend our country with whatever means are available for you.  and put the blame where it belongs, on the socialist demonrats.
And always remember i love you
And apparently the other duties include screwing people out of their living.
And by his logic the native Americans are the only real Americans.
And fix the voting system. Or all is lost by democrat socialists & Soros cheating.
And get rid of Republican and Democrat parties and be a team player as one
And hes a trump supporter, hmmm
And if you don‚Äôt look out for your citizens?? At what point does one outweigh another. You truly can‚Äôt say you care about America when there is so many people working for the government, your government, not getting paid....I mean come on
And if your lawyers don‚Äôt defend you you‚Äôll be executed for treason.
And it should also be the duty of all of our congress people.  But the progressive/socialists that now control the DNC want their politically correct hope and change mandate to over ride all laws and the Constitution which would have been gone by now had HiLIARy been elected.
And let no one convince you any different !
And let‚Äôs take all the garbage and backed up toilet stuff from the national parks and throw it on the white house lawn and mitch mcconnells lawn in front of his house.  If dumpster is willing to continue the shutdown for years then ‚Äòborder security‚Äô can‚Äôt be much of an ‚Äòemergency‚Äô now can it? A repulsican congress saw no ‚Äòemergency‚Äô for 2 years, now it‚Äôs an emergency?  No.   And we'll ignore the fact that Don the Con hasn't even spent the money he's already been given on border security. And that 90% of the drugs come in through the ports, sneaked in through official entry points at harbors and airports and the majority of undocumented immigrants arrive by plane, not hiking across the desert. And we‚Äôll ignoring the fact that native-born Americans commit crime at higher rates. And ‚Äòborder security‚Äô has held for over 200 years. The Wall is a scam and this SOB scum needs to be removed.  2018 12 terrorist list Southern border crossings  41 terrorist list Northern border crossings Build a Northern Border Wall and Canada will pay for it.

And shutting the govt down for a walk doesn‚Äôt help that matter.
And so it should be.  Thank u Mr President!
And so should the people in America! And if they disagree, then they should move on the other side of the border and see how they like that!
And some of those countries they don't even give vaccinations so we get diseases from other countries because open borders makes sense to me
And stop all payment to all Democrats while they are on strike in a government shutdown if our men and women who are defending our country are not getting paid then those worthless pieces of garbage should not get paid either
And that includes all members of Congress duty too.
And that means protecting all Americans black white and everything in between. We are all Americans. Unless your here ileagly . God bless America and the defense of freedom!
And that sir was my number one priority!   So many coming in and trying to change our ways. As ILLEGALS.
And that's the truth
And the Dems know it which is why they are trying to stop it
And the left knows this and just look at them, Homo's and foreigners?
And the liberals laugh.  They must detest America.
And the whole time we have Americans sneaking to Canada for free health care.

And why is your suit only wrinkled on your left side all the time?  Is that the side you sleep on when in the Oval office?

Andrew Spencer that‚Äôs ok just my opinion üëç
Andrew Vincent,   1) either be proactive or reactive about immigration. Your entire foundation is reactive because it doesn‚Äôt come with a better plan   2) meet halfway? You mean by Pelosi and Schumer saying no wall is meeting halfway?   3) I put Mexico paying for the wall in the same bucket with shovel ready jobs and affordable healthcare. Mine is now $1,440 per month and I have bern taking it on the chin for years. Some ideas just can‚Äôt be fulfilled! Let‚Äôs not act like politicians haven‚Äôt failed us in the past!
Andrew Vincent, last century? Unless you also live in a last century house, technology has improved all we build, even using sensors to help see tunnels and other things. To use a medieval analogy isn‚Äôt being very truthful   But how do you process people legally if they can walk in undetected nearly everywhere? Plus how do you guarantee work for amounts of immigrants you can‚Äôt control their entry?
Andrew Vincent, no one said there was one solution to fix illegal immigration. But the wall will be a beginning.   While it‚Äôs not your job to be proactive, it is the job of Americans to evaluate what solutions our representatives come up with to see if it is feasible and makes sense. Isn‚Äôt it how we evaluate coworkers and even family members, to say nothing of ourselves?   Pelosi said on tape she will oppose Trump‚Äôs wall. Now she did use some nebulous references about some kind of barrier in certain places. But in February 2018, wasn‚Äôt it Pelosi who said we should cut the grass instead?   You want to talk about a sales pitch? You mean like passing the ACA even without fully reading it? Are you serious?
Andrew Vincent, ok, let‚Äôs examine all you said...  1) by not having a better solution other than a wall, you‚Äôd rather take a pragmatic approach and do nothing. This means illegal immigration, which costs anywhere between 54-125 billion annually not only continues, but grows in expense. Do you think such a response will increase, decrease, or have no affect on 22 trillion in debt?   2) what does ‚Äúenhanced border security‚Äù mean? Democrats can‚Äôt even come up with a number of how many agents would be required, much less generate an annual expense.   3) I‚Äôd rather spend 30 billion today on a wall, about 10% of the interest alone on our debt (that no American benefits from) to possibly curb the obvious increase in illegal immigration costs. Then if years later, some resident genius comes up with a better solution, then let‚Äôs go for it!
Andrew Vincent, then what you are saying is you aren‚Äôt interested in Pelosi or Schumer taking some of the 54 billion in discretionary spending available to fix the water issues in flint? If not, what would you like them to do with the money?
Andrew Vincent, yes and 5.7 billion is only 1/60th of the annual interest of 22 trillion in debt

Anne Crossway you obviously don‚Äôt know the full spectrum of the word security. I suggest joining the military and learning üòÇü§£ It‚Äôs called a deterrent. It‚Äôs not an end all solution, only part of the whole package (barrier, cameras, more personnel, equipment, etc...).  Democrats were all for a wall/barrier/fencing before, the ONLY reason they‚Äôre against it now is because of President Trump ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The President can literally come out with the cure to cancer and the Dems would be against it üòÇü§£ The President has and is still willing to compromise, like he did with DACA, and the Dems aren‚Äôt.....

Anne Crossway you‚Äôre a special kind of stupid! Tell me how much Obama got for border security and where all those billions went? I‚Äôll give you a hint, it was billions more than what trump is asking for and he will actually spend it on what it‚Äôs allotted for. Now I‚Äôll wait!

Apparently, both sides pan Nazi Stephen Miller‚Äôs border script, read by Emperor Fullofshiticus:  News Analysis In Trump‚Äôs Immigration Announcement, a Compromise Snubbed All Around WASHINGTON ‚Äî Immigrant advocates denounced it as cruel. The conservative right howled that it was amnesty. What President Trump billed on Saturday as a compromise to end the country‚Äôs longest government shutdown pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs to strike a deal nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall. Instead, in offering temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for funding for a wall, Mr. Trump did something rarely seen during his presidency. He tried to reach beyond his base of supporters ‚Äî which polls have begun to show is losing patience with him as the partial shutdown drags into its fifth week ‚Äî and speak to a broader swath of Americans. The Saturday afternoon speech from the West Wing was an attempt by Mr. Trump to, at the very least, shift the narrative of the past several weeks and show that rather than spoiling for a longer shutdown fight or making unreasonable demands, he was looking for a broadly acceptable way out of a morass he once boasted he was proud to wade into. ‚ÄúI think you could tell by the president‚Äôs remarks today,‚Äù Vice President Mike Pence said, ‚Äúthat we‚Äôre reaching out.‚Äù Yet in seeking to inch toward the center, Mr. Trump alienated portions of his hard-right base, the core supporters he most depends on and the group he and his closest aides have most feared losing. That raised the possibility that, in his zeal to get out of an intractable situation, he may have landed himself in the worst of all worlds, without a clear solution or the support of his most ardent followers. The tensions and anger over the policy have been quietly playing out in the West Wing as well, as Jared Kushner, the president‚Äôs son-in-law and senior adviser, fended off Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump‚Äôs immigration agenda. Mr. Kushner has long been a proponent of protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, while Mr. Miller has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration. In recent days, as White House officials had been working out the details of the compromise, Mr. Miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity. While the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that protected those illegally brought to the United States as children, Mr. Trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700,000 who are enrolled. Mr. Kushner conceded in a briefing after the president‚Äôs speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the DACA program, which Mr. Trump moved to rescind in 2017. ‚ÄúAt this moment in time,‚Äù Mr. Kushner said, ‚Äúthis is a good path forward.‚Äù Many conservatives did not share that view. ‚ÄúTrump proposes amnesty,‚Äù the conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Twitter. ‚ÄúWe voted for Trump and got Jeb!‚Äù she added, referring to Jeb Bush, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. Still, in the eyes of many White House officials, the prospect that Mr. Trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure Democrats to end the impasse was worth trying. Mr. Pence argued on Saturday that the speech was a ‚Äúsincere effort‚Äù by Mr. Trump to break the logjam, and he and other White House officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist Democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with Republicans. But such a coalition did not appear to be forming, and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention, eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak-kneed capitulation. The vast majority of Democrats knocked the approach. While many of them have pressed for measures to protect DACA recipients and immigrants living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe, most regard the proposal he put forth on Saturday as woefully inadequate. It offers only three years of protections for the DACA recipients and those who hold T.P.S., which the Trump administration has also moved to end for several countries. ‚ÄúThis is not an amnesty bill,‚Äù Mr. Pence said. ‚ÄúThere is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal.‚Äù That was high on Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs list of reasons to call the plan ‚Äúunacceptable.‚Äù That is unlikely to matter to the president. Despite saying publicly last month that he would be proud to own a shutdown over the wall, and privately displaying confidence that his base would stick with him through the fight, Mr. Trump has been dismayed to find otherwise in recent days. An NPR poll released last week showed Mr. Trump‚Äôs approval ratings down and the first cracks in backing among critical supporters, including whites without a college education and white evangelicals. Such pressure from what he has called the forgotten men and women who elected him and chant ‚ÄúBuild! The! Wall!‚Äù at his arena rallies has swayed Mr. Trump before, including last year, when the conservative news site Breitbart branded him ‚ÄúAmnesty Don‚Äù for considering a similar deal that would have provided $25 billion in wall funding for a path to legal status for those the DACA program was created to help. The president ultimately abandoned that agreement, concerned about angering his base and after Mr. Miller and others advised him he should insist on additional immigration restrictions. On Saturday night, Breitbart panned Mr. Trump‚Äôs latest idea with the headline ‚ÄúThree-Year Amnesty, Most of Border Remains Open.‚Äù  Reported by The (We Are Doing Very Well, Thank You Very Much) NY Times
April Foster all these anti-trump bashing points are starting to look like overused pickup lines...   Haven't seen the money we're now getting from Mexico that we NEVER saw before in trade? " it's peanuts compared to what he is asking for the wall "   Big changes for cars. The goal of the new deal is to have more cars and truck parts made in North America. Starting in 2020, to qualify for zero tariffs, a car or truck must have 75 percent of its components manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the United States, a substantial boost from the current 62.5 percent requirement.  There‚Äôs also a new rule that a significant percentage of the work done on the car must be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour, or about three times what the typical Mexican autoworker makes. Starting in 2020, cars and trucks should have at least 30 percent of the work on the vehicle done by workers earning $16 an hour. That gradually moves up to 40 percent for cars by 2023.  While many economists think these new rules will help some North American workers, they also warn that car prices might rise and some small cars may no longer be made in North America because they would be too expensive under the new requirements. There are also concerns that automakers might not make as many cars in North America to export to China and elsewhere overseas because costs would be higher in the USMCA region than making the vehicles in Asia.  Trump‚Äôs victory: Canada opens up its milk market to U.S. farmers. Trump tweeted often about how unfair he thought it was that Canada charged such high tariffs on U.S. dairy products. Canada has a complex milk and dairy system. To ensure Canadian dairy farmers don‚Äôt go bankrupt, the Canadian government restricts how much dairy can be produced in the country and how much foreign dairy can enter to keep milk prices high. Trump didn‚Äôt like that, and dairy was a major sticking point in the negotiations.  In the end, Canada is keeping most of its complex system in place, but it is giving greater market share to U.S. dairy farmers. U.S. negotiators say they got a major victory by forcing Canada to eliminate the pricing scheme for what are known as Class 7 dairy products. That means U.S. dairy farmers can probably send a lot more milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder and infant formula to Canada (and those products are relatively easy to transport and store).  Canada‚Äôs victory: Chapter 19, allowing for a special dispute process, stays intact. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said repeatedly that he wanted to keep Chapter 19 in place, and that‚Äôs exactly what happened. The U.S. side pushed hard to eliminate this chapter, but in the end, it stayed.  Chapter 19 allows Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another‚Äôs anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court. Over the years, Canada has successfully used Chapter 19 to challenge the United States on its softwood lumber restrictions.  Mexico and Canada get assurance Trump won‚Äôt pound them with auto tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened to slap hefty tariffs on car and vehicle parts coming from overseas into the United States. Along with the new trade deal, his administration signed ‚Äúside letters‚Äù allowing the two nations to mostly dodge Trump‚Äôs auto tariffs.  The side letters say Canada and Mexico can continue sending about the same vehicles and parts across the border free of charge, regardless of whether auto tariffs go into effect down the road. Only parts above that quota could face tariffs.  Trump‚Äôs steel tariffs stay in place (for now). Canada wanted Trump to stop his 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel. That didn‚Äôt happen ‚Äî yet. The two countries are still discussing lifting those tariffs, but a senior White House official said Sunday that process is on a ‚Äúcompletely separate track.‚Äù Trudeau has called the steel tariffs ‚Äúinsulting and unacceptable‚Äù because the two nations are such close allies.  Improved labor and environmental rights. The USMCA makes a number of significant upgrades to environmental and labor regulations, especially regarding Mexico. For example, the USMCA stipulates that Mexican trucks that cross the border into the United States must meet higher safety regulations and that Mexican workers must have more ability to organize and form unions. Some of these provisions might be difficult to enforce, but the Trump administration says it is committed to ensuring these happen ‚Äî a reason U.S. labor unions and some Democrats are cheering the new rules.  Increased intellectual property protections. The new IP chapter is 63 pages and contains more-stringent protections for patents and trademarks, including for biotech, financial services and even domain names. Many business leaders and legal experts believed these updates were necessary given that the original agreement was negotiated 25 years ago.  Big drug companies gain more footing in Canada. U.S. drug companies will now be able to sell pharmaceuticals in Canada for 10 years before facing generic competition. That‚Äôs up from eight years of so-called ‚Äúmarket protection‚Äù now.  Deal must be reviewed after 6 years. The USMCA stipulates that the three nations will review the agreement after six years. If all parties agree it‚Äôs still good, then the deal will continue for the full 16 year period (with the ability to renew after that for another 16 years). This was a compromise provision: Trump wanted ability to renegotiate the deal frequently. Ultimately, there will be a review, but it won‚Äôt happen until after Trump leaves office.  Chapter 11, giving investors a special way to fight government decisions, is (mostly) gone. Chapter 11 is eliminated entirely for Canada and mostly for Mexico, except for some key industries such as energy and telecommunications. Chapter 11 gave companies and investors a special process to resolve disputes with one of the governments in NAFTA. The idea was that if investors put a lot of money into a project and then the government changed the rules, there was a clear dispute process ‚Äî outside the court system ‚Äî where investors could get their problem resolved.  Critics argue that Chapter 11 was mainly used as a way for big corporations to get taxpayer money, but businesses say it was necessary to ensure they weren‚Äôt harmed by sudden changes when new governments came into power in Mexico, Canada or the United States. In the end, Chapter 11 is mostly gone, except for a few key industries, such as oil, that lobbied hard to be able to challenge the Mexican government if it changes the rules and tries to nationalize its energy sector again.

At a time when Deep State NWO socialists have worked so hard disarming our nation - between weakening our military, police, and borders, it absolutely is.  It won't be easy working with a Congress that has been infiltrated by anti-Americans, and intentionally filled all leadership positions with socialist hacks, but you can do it. They are attempting a coup not only against you, but against the sovereignty of our country and I truly believe the LORD has put you in office for this very reason. You're doing a GREAT job.  Thank you from We The People.
At least he cares about American citizens more than illegals !!!
At least he love our America! Thank God for our Great President Trump!!!! üôèüá∫üá∏
At least the Trump Trolls here are receiving their paychecks.

BREAKING: Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen asserts that he paid a tech firm to rig online polls in Trump's favor during the 2016 campaign "at the direction of and the sole benefit of" Trump.  It's clear that Trump and his cronies will go to extreme lengths to undermine our elections and bury the truth.

BUILD THE WALL. Truth is a bedrock foundation. Continue to call out the Socialist, Marxist as they are. Define who they are, and the abject failure their ideas are. And their messengers for who that they are. This is cultural war we are engaged in. They are afraid of you because you got elected from outside their system. You will be in charge for another 6 years. It is time to put them in the dust pile of history as an abject failure. Run our country as the business model that made you successful.

Bakhtyar Abdullah do it legally! U do know what that word means right?
Ban guns.
Barb Thornberry do you know more the the patrolmen that have their boots on the ground that say they desperately need walls.
Barbara Anderson oh man, again I asked a question, and now my upbringing, reproductive organs, and intentions are being questioned.  It is easy to be an asshole, and I‚Äôm good at being one, but that was not the intent here.  I asked a question.
Barbara Anderson what the f*** do you know? There are hundreds of miles of border with no one watching and people just streaming across. Guess where I live. Now think about where you live. Butt out stupid
Barbara Beth Miller definitely not definitely
Barbara Beth Miller more importantly, damn your ugly!!
Barbara Davis That would be awesome!
Barbara Hernandez You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress. Can you think of a reason he didn‚Äôt do it when he could?
Barbara Hill  Secure borders, Yes. All Americans want that.  A big beautiful wall is a waste of taxpayers money.  This shutdown is hurting your fellow Americans.  #NOWALL #OPENTHEGOVERNMENT

Barbara Hill Donny is sealing his fate as a one-term president!  Bwahahahahaha!!  Talk about obvious statements...EVERYONE agrees we need border security.  What we don‚Äôt need is his cost-ineffective wall.  Donny needs to agree to the bipartisan deal already passed by Congress so his shutdown does not completely destroy our economy.  Just give it up now and reopen our government!!!  Trump doubles down on border wall, as polls show voters turning against his shutdown strategy  https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doubles-down-on-border-wall-as-polls-show-voters-turning-against-his-shutdown-strategy

Barbara Hill nope.  It won't.
Barbara Hill where did you get your stats that trafficking was as a direct result of illegal immigrants entering at illegal points of entry?? Or are you like trump, spewing alternative facts???!!

Barry Davis you need to get out more. You spend too much time in your parents basement.
Barry Davis.  You obviously have zero understanding of American history and the presidents who have given their time and talents to improving the life of Americans ... unlike trump who is only tearing down institutions and programs that we the people have established through our elected representatives throughout the decades.  You are obviously oblivious to the fact that unlike any other American president trump has given more to our enemy Putin who probably controls him or has something on him that he is obviously concealing.  If you don't agree tell me another American president who invited Russians and their media into the White House while not having OUR media there and where he spilled Israeli secrets to the russians.  That's not fake news we saw it happen before our eyes as was reported by America's free press (thanks to the Constitutional protection that our free press has, deserves and earns every time they expose trump's lies.
Barry weakened America and made us the laughing stock of the world!  Time to make us the greatest nation on earth again!
Be an online nation. Cyber nationalism. Tax the world. Feed em with hamberders
Be honest.  This isn‚Äôt about border security.  This is about TRUMP security.
Be strong Mr. President and don't let Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer control you !
Beautiful
Because if we have open borders then all the invaders will come and overload the systems and break down the United States. Then the globalist can move forward with the new world order.
Because nobody else has borders probably
Because they knew it was bullshit now they can blame the democrats
Because this is all false.
Because were the only ones stupid enough to reward them for breaking the law. So they love our open borders.  I said sharp shooters should be all across the boarder. Anything that comes over just shoot it.. but its "inhumane"
Because you are a fake profile. Lol REPORTED.
Before Trump was born,the American borders were secure, how did his ancestors got to America?
Behind you 100%!!!  BRILLIANT move today dealing with ol' Nasty Pelousey!  Been LMAO all afternoon!!  You should've told her to take her broom!!!  üòÅüòÉüòÑüòÄ

Beverly Hurst Smith - https://trumpatwar.com/
Beverly Hurst Smith ???
Beverly Hurst Smith Ask me what i did for the last two years.
Beverly Hurst Smith BINGO. He and the GOP didn‚Äôt do anything because the didn‚Äôt want the fallout. All of this crisis stuff and shutdown stuff is for Trumps base. It could have already been funded and in progress by now. THEY HAD ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.
Beverly Hurst Smith OMG! Civics 101 doesn‚Äôt exist in the Democrat party! Ignorance is bliss! üôÑ
Beverly Hurst Smith Think of it this way, hardly anyone in Congress was supporting or helping him. The Democrats and Rinos were working against him and the MSM had a constant drumbeat of anti Trumpism going 24/7.  Look at what he did accomplish in spite of that.  Americans have always supported an under dog. Trump by every means Trump is that under dog.
Beverly Hurst Smith Trump 2020
Beverly Hurst Smith Trump is a joke.  He‚Äôs Russia‚Äôs puppet.
Beverly Hurst Smith a hell of a lot more than any dummycrap. And thats FACTS!!!!!!
Beverly Hurst Smith all he did was flap that big mouth and spew lies and nonsense
Beverly Hurst Smith blinded by hate..
Beverly Hurst Smith didn't have the votes and didn't have caravans lining up paid by soros
Beverly Hurst Smith he didn't have the votes. Needed 8 democraps voting with Republicans.
Beverly Hurst Smith he is working for us while all you heard was the media bashing him. He is and has been building the wall and fixing it already. He has made people work 20 hours to get medicade and EBT and most were dropped because they refused to do even that. Saved tax payers money üòäso much more even, thank you President Trump! üòç
Beverly Hurst Smith he never had full control.  The Senate needed 60 votes so why don't you get your facts straight and take some civics classes.  McConnell should have used the nuclear option like he did with Supreme Court justices (Harry Reid started it) and we wouldn't be where we are today. DEMOCRATIC SHUTDOWN totally.
Beverly Hurst Smith hey dummy he has never had the 60 votes needed. Obummer had the 60 votes when he lied to the voters about Obamacare
Beverly Hurst Smith hey ignorant one the dumbasses from both parties have been fighting him but NOW WE Have. Two thousand people pushing at our border thinking they have a right here and another couple thousand heading our way.  If that's not an immediate crisis. I don't know what is.
Beverly Hurst Smith idiot
Beverly Hurst Smith it was on the platform when we elected our president but the libs have and has stopped him in his attempts to protect the American people.
Beverly Hurst Smith it‚Äôs a distraction from his real problem
Beverly Hurst Smith liberalism is definitely a mental disorder sister.
Beverly Hurst Smith lower gas prices ,lowest unemployment in decades , exited the Paris climate agreement ,exited NAFTA,  best economy in decades , highest stock market I  decades , 4 % economic growth , made United states a exporter of crude oil for the first time in decades,  won a unbeatable election , made more areest in human trafficking in 2yrs than the whole Obama tems combined ! Pissed off winning crying little bitches like you !
Beverly Hurst Smith more than Obama
Beverly Hurst Smith more than any other president in history in his first 2 years maybe... get a clue.
Beverly Hurst Smith not a damn thing
Beverly Hurst Smith oh I don't know he didn't do much. Just turned the economy around big time, created best unemployment in over 50 yrs. Got North Korea to the table, the first President ever to do that, got the GDP up to double what Obama ever achieved, got over 500,000 manufacturing jobs back from Mexico and China, got new and better trade deals with South Korea, Canada, Mexico and others. Etc etc etc. No didn't do much in the last 2 yrs. üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
Beverly Hurst Smith still didn't have the votes and there was not a huge caravan.
Beverly Hurst Smith stupid bev. He needed democrat votes.
Beverly Hurst Smith thank you President Trump for all you've done & still doing for our country!!!
Beverly Hurst Smith thats because it was just recent that the globalist like Soros started the caravans.
Beverly Hurst Smith the republicans controlled the house and he still could not convince all the republicans about his stupid ideas
Beverly Hurst Smith took him a while to straighten things out after 8 years of Odummer...he's the President...not a magician
Beverly Hurst Smith wimpy a*# republicans wouldn‚Äôt do their job! WIMPS WIMPS WIMPS ..that‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt get done! Repubs are Dems in disguise
Beverly Hurst Smith you are either funny or stupid!  The Democrats in the Senate vowed to oppose and block anything this Administration puts forth and they had enough votes to do it!
Beverly Hurst Smith you know you really should know your history and how Congress and the Senate works we did not have the votes in the Senate hello are you there is anybody home in that head of yours
Beverly Hurst Smith you need 60 votes in the Senate to pass border security and the Democrats resisted.
Beverly Hurst Smith, sad to see you can't fix stupid. Have a nice day anyway.
Bi pass the Dems .  Don‚Äôt let them stand in your way.

Bill Ciszkowski you‚Äôre a moron and a disgrace to humanity
Bill Klein, you must really hate America if you think any of what you just spouted off was a bad thing.and btw Russia wouldn't have wanted him to do any of that. What he has done is the best thing for America. TRUMP 2020 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
Bill Lowery We the people elected Democrats to the House. Quit listening to that propaganda Fox News throws out there! Trump couldn't get money for the wall with Republican's in control of Congress, he's not going to get it now.
Bill Miller How do you sleep at night being a communist!
Bill Miller Trump legally can build a wall all you have to do is declare martial law or a state of emergency and he is in charge of the defense department he is the commander and chief of all military branches in the United States. The money you ask he already has for the defense department from Congress last year. So he legally has the authority to build the wall without Congress.
Bill Miller Your fake account has reported coward scum! Don‚Äôt you FAKE accounts realize you‚Äôre just helping our side unite even further? Ha, thanks!!
Bill Miller you live in PA , what do you know about border life?? Nothing. Everyone on the border wants the wall, or a large percentage . Until you have lived in a border city you will never understand the impact so please spare us your uneducated opinion!
Bill Miller youncantbargue with ignorance

Blaine Tundler   You will be waiting quite a while. No one is against border security. Absolutely no one. The only debate is how most effectively and cost-effectively to do it. I know my math is a little rough, but I understand this wall will cost about $30 billion. A virtual wall can be created for around 1 billion. He‚Äôs been offered 1.6 billion already to upgrade and repair existing structure. The $27.4 billion difference could pay an additional 4750 border patrol agents for 100 years. In my book, that‚Äôs a hell of a lot better idea than borrowing another $30 billion from China and paying interest on it.
Blaine Tundler I hate liars, and your good at it, also I didn't know they let monkeys at the zoo cut hair, What a disaster.
Blaine Tundler sure they are. You need to stop watching fake news CNN.
Blaine Tundler what are they calling then, they want open borders there other way to explain it
Blaine Tundler where what countries
Blaine Tundler yes they are
Bless our President & his Family. Thank you for working to make USA great again. Cooperation from Congress is what is needed.

Bloated lying POS. We've been here a long time without a wall and will continue to be, you egomaniac. Whether you die, are impeached or resign doesn't matter as long as you and your mafia goons are out of the WH. That will MAGA! FU and your wall.

Bob Kelley Let's get to it, I don't understand why as the President, You can't take 5.3 Billion of the Mexican Cartels Drug Money and build the damn Wall !! What are they going to do, demand it back, I don't think that's happening and then you can Boast that the Mexican's really did pay for the WALL !! So lets get this done, your the President GET ER DONE..... then open the Government and make Nancy and Chuckie look like the ass's they are..... then how many crossover supporter's will you have, for coming up with this idea !!!!

Bob Segal I just think the wall is a simplified last century solution to a modern problem. I believe in processing folks legally or claiming asylum... which is a human right
Bob Segal The DHS and ICE study this all the time.  There are government stats.  You‚Äôre trying to tell me that they are all made up.  C‚Äômon man!
Bob Segal considering most undocumented folks come through ALL ports of entry, perhaps we should build levees and a giant rooftop over the continental US..  It is not my job to be proactive. That would be the commander-in-cheif's job. My responsibility is to vote accordance to his performance...üò¨üòí   Idk where you got the "no wall" info. It is well known what the Dems have to offer and the wall is apart of the deal. It is the pricetag that goes with it.   And how convenient to place a broken promise 2 years after the fact. You know it was a race baiting sales pitch pipe dream to appeal to the disenfranchised and you know it. And dont try and weasel in anti-obama rhetoric to prove a point. We all know it was a Democratic agenda that was haphazardly dependant on young consumers who are, for the most part, young and healthy.
Bob Segal idk but I was hoping 1 out of 300m voters could come up with a solution. My solution is the most logical but least popular which is to legalize narcotics, squander cartels, cease citizens uprooting themselves and risking life here, and use that wall $ for rehabs and drug prevention centers.  Let's face it. This whole problem stems from our country snorting and shooting up the issue that ultimately turned our current issue into fruition.  All of this is our fault. I am one of the few who humbly admits it.  And to counter argue your point, getting over, under, and through the wall has also become more advance as well. The wall is an expensive short term simplistic solution.
Bob Segal murdering bitch.
Bob Segal or 100% repairing Flint MI some drinking water. Or solve world hunger for a year.  But hey, it is his legacy he wants to taint...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Bob Segal there is no overdosing today unless you're doing illegal drugs which majority of people in this country are on prescription drugs because it works I'm on prescription drugs and I'm not overdosing shows how stupid you are and you should be expected too.
Bob Segal you should be executed just like Trump..
Bob Segal: The border security budget wasn‚Äôt even all spent last year.  Immigration at the south border has been on the decline.  Why does Trump all of a Send say there is a crisis?
Bobb Marly it's still not 100% foolproof and we don't have an unsecured border like the tRumpsters like to call it..tell those that patrol it that it's unsecured
Bobb Marly my brother these are the days of coming of Christ i meant it in a way where as life isnt meant to be thiz way God bless you. I walk with Christ
Bobb Marly the point was, did the wall solve any problems, and if so, why does it not exist today?
Bobby Wilson a lot of people here want a wall for border security but couldn‚Äôt care less if terrorists board planes and commit acts of terror. Damn hypocrites
Bobby Wilson bye bye Bobby, sweety... go find a safe space
Bobby Wilson call pelosi and tell her!!
Bobby Wilson fund the wall like you agreed to over the years then the president will open the govt.
Bobby Wilson keep them closed as long as it takes. Build the wall.
Bobby Wilson maybe the Dems who originally voted FOR the wall should stop pretending to be against it
Bobby Wilson people are well aware of the risks with taking a government job. They made a choice. It‚Äôs good for them in a way. Keeps them thinking. If they wana go make a paycheck tomorrow they can.
Bobby Wilson run along cupcake
Bobby Wilson seems to me, the democrats won't meet with our president and negotiate...dude, call Nancy and Chuck.
Bobby Wilson stop whining
Bobby Wilson talk to Chuck and Nancy about that.
Bobby Wilson they will get back pay. Meanwhile I would like to get my community back, so I want border security.
Bobby Wilson you ARE talking to the DEMOCRATS in Congress, right?! ü§î
Bobby Wilson. 5.7 billion please!
Bobby Wilson: Looks like having a government job is not so luxurious after all and has its drawbacks.  Government jobs are the #1 biggest expense this country has and is the very reason our country is in such a deficit.  Converting us from a 'Republic For Which It Stands", to a never ending bloating Democracy Big Government has proven to be a disaster of which I am saddened to see that your just beginning to experience.  Our Founding Forefathers gave us a Republic not a Democracy!  They warned us, "If You Can Keep It".
Bonita Selzler they have tried.  He has painted himself into a corner where he is unable to negotiate.
Bonnie S. Pickett Because there are fanatics like the trump supporters who have come felt free to express their hatred due to trump's encouragement with his hateful tweets. :)
Bonnie S. Pickett because they say one thing preach another, they hypocrites.

Border Security is a must.  Keeping Illegal immigrants out of the United States is important.     How would you  feel if your neighbors took the liberty & jumped over the wooden fence in your backyard & invaded your privacy ,& home???
Border patrol and customs, TSA, and Coast Guard  non essential Federal employees all not fully staffed.  How is that protecting our  borders again? Asking for a friend.
Border patrol üòÇ we still gonna get through.
Border security is a must
Border security is a priority, but we shouldn‚Äôt build ‚ÄúTrumps Folly‚Äù, President Donald J. Trump.
Border security is an endless money pit.
Border security is not the same thing as a wall.
Border security is the best answer!Build the wall.Stand Strong!!!
Borders will be safe once you‚Äôre behind bars, TSA agents are paid, and Border Patrol employees are paid.
Borders?  I've only heard of the ONE border   ‚ÄúHe is shutting down the government to break his signature campaign promise. His signature campaign promise was that the taxpayers weren‚Äôt going to have to pay for it.‚Äù The House Armed Services Committee Chairman said on ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù When you keep your promise, the wall can be built.

Boy u sure stirred them up with this!
Brandon Detwiler agreed
Brandon Wright slowing down illegal immigration would help our homeless and needy immensely. Do you know how much our government programs are giving money , food stamps, free medical, etc. to illegals!? While our vets and needy citizens go without. In the state of Colorado, if you are illegal, you will pretty much instantly qualify for government assistance. It is sickening.
Brenda Flores he did not say that
Brenda Flores it would take an idiot to vote for the new Marxist democrats
Brett White Do you believe all of Trump's lies?
Brett White no snowflake here I am the storm
Brian Nixon Yes, Nancy and Chuck better wake up and make a deal for the LEGAL TAXPAYING AMERICAN CITIZENS and not for their greedy selves.
Brian Nixon also this is not related, but I noticed your recent post, and I agree that wildfires are a terrible issue. I'm unsure, then, why house democrats rejected a proposed bill for increased funding towards wildfire prevention methods?
Brian Nixon do your research...the country blows that amount taking care of others, not the hard working taxpaying citizens of the USA.
Brian Nixon how do they pay taxes? Don't you need SS# or visa to work?
Brian Nixon oh sales tax. Why would they get that back, do we?
Brilliant so that means you are resigning
Bring it on honey !! Don't forget to bring your pitchfork to the gun fight...
Britain has failed to defend our borders and we are in danger of ceasing to be a nation! We are actually in danger of becoming somebody else's nation! Build the wall!
Bruce Hale show us one Democrat that supports ISIS, or MS13, or illegal immigration. You plainly show your bias and hatred for those that are working to oppose Donald Trump, but show no compassion for those that Trump's government shutdown impacts more severely each day. How would you feel if you were forced to work unpaid for a month just so Donald Trump has a hostage to bargain with for his wall. You support a dealmaker who cares little for 800,000 civil servants and thousands of others who are working longer hours to keep things running without them. No true American or Christian could act so cruelly.

Buck Strunk Dude, if your meaning is "walled border", you have your list inverted...  About 32 out of 195 countries have walled borders...
Buck Strunk Ever heard of Ellis Island? Never forget: we are ALL immigrants here. Under tRump, we‚Äôve all become meaner and uglier to one another. Make America Kind again!
Buck Strunk Have You Never Heard Of The Great Wall Of China?
Buck Strunk He‚Äôs married to an illegal. Which of the criteria for the Einstein Visa did she meet??  ü§î https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EB-1_visaen.wikipedia.org
Buck Strunk I don't believe the US has ever had open borders.   Maybe you're just a twat?
Buck Strunk I guess you're unaware that we do not have open borders buck. We have barriers in place in certain areas and the border patrol is doing a fantastic job. This is all a scare tactic that you believe from your president. I never want to hear the word wall again because everybody's obsessed with it
Buck Strunk Mexico and Canada do... in fact, most countries have fairly porous borders.  Lol.
Buck Strunk Most other countries have open borders.
Buck Strunk NO ONE wants open borders doofus! Quit drinking the faux koolaid
Buck Strunk No it doesn‚Äôt. The biggest wall in the world is the Great Wall of China. The Vatican has a wall like many town/ cities in Italy when it was made up of city states prior to becoming a nation. Lots of cities across Europe have walls, built during the medieval period not this century or the last. Examples such as the Vatican  are not a valid comparison to Trump‚Äôs plan.
Buck Strunk Not True. Almost all of Europe has appendix border. I will be in Switzerland and all I need is a Visa. Do not talk if you do not know. You are an ignorant.
Buck Strunk RIGHT ON BUCK. BUILD THAT WALL.
Buck Strunk Sigh...Do you have open borders right now?
Buck Strunk So we should do what other countries do?
Buck Strunk THANK YOU üôåüèªüôèüèªüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüá∫üá∏
Buck Strunk THE BORDERS AREN'T OPEN DUMB AZ! https://www.facebook.com/268914272540/posts/10155952624017541/
Buck Strunk This was not your country, read the history, how you got here and made this land your own.  All the whites were illegals, experienced in torturing, tormenting and butchering the Native Americans.
Buck Strunk Uh, we don‚Äôt have open borders.
Buck Strunk Vatican has the biggest wall in the world?  In what fantasy land are you seeing this?  You can walk right into St. Peter's Square, and the whole Vatican is not surrounded by a wall.  Sorry.
Buck Strunk What about the Great Wall in China? That is the worlds largest wall & China was still invaded by the Mongols! Not by imaginary caravans!
Buck Strunk Wrong, as pointed out here. But that's these other countries' misfortune and bad judgement.
Buck Strunk You got that right.
Buck Strunk actually it‚Äôs not accurate your BS.. it‚Äôs surrounded but totally open in the frontside!
Buck Strunk actually, plenty of countries have open borders. And they‚Äôve all turned to trash. üòâ
Buck Strunk are you okay?
Buck Strunk are you serious?
Buck Strunk changed has to start somewhere right so build the wall it's a start on cleaning up the drugs. Unless you want the drug.
Buck Strunk clearly you don‚Äôt know what is going on. The States does NOT have ‚Äúopen borders‚Äù. Do your homework
Buck Strunk do you read at all?
Buck Strunk do you seriously think that every other country in the world has walls around it except for the United States? üôÑ
Buck Strunk especially at the expense of TSA and and Air Traffic Controllers. WTF!?!?

Buck Strunk in the vatican's defense everything in the Vatican is made of gold
Buck Strunk is that your real name fucktard?
Buck Strunk lie
Buck Strunk most countries have open boarders
Buck Strunk no body wants open borders. Not even Democrats.
Buck Strunk no more crack for you
Buck Strunk no one wants that. But a lot of other countries have universal health care, so by your logic, we should too
Buck Strunk no other country besides Russia North Korea has an ASSHOLE as president it holds American workers hostage because Trump don't get what he wants  .who the Flying F said we have open borders we have miles miles miles of Boarder security checkpoints including the one up north so why you freaking telling that Damm lie  oh I forget your a Trump Supporter you believe any lie that comes out of the Jackass I used to love this Country but Trump sorry ass made that Country into a Country of  Hate and you all think this ok .if you love Trump this show you love someone as Freaking dictator
Buck Strunk no other country has a wall around it. Canada, Russia, China, Brazil none has a border wall.

Buck Strunk stupid as remark
Buck Strunk the 28 countries in the European Union have open borders. Try escaping your little bubble, the world is bigger than the US
Buck Strunk they aren‚Äôt open here either
Buck Strunk to bad the people who are brave enough to stand at that boarder and protect the nation didn‚Äôt get paid thanks to his wall.   #paythecoastguard #paydhs
Buck Strunk totally agree. Trump however urged his base to vote for him in the simplest terms: rapists and murderers are coming across the border‚Äîvote for me, I‚Äôll build a big wall. Try and get some perspective. 30,000 Americans are injured or killed by gun violence committed by other Americans in this country every year. A $20,000,000,000 wall will not protect you from people who want to pick fruit and vegetables.
Buck Strunk try China for the biggest wall.... you bigly fucknugget

Buck Strunk yes, there are many other countries in Europe for example.. Had you ever been out of the United States?
Buck Strunk yes. We have. Now see what is happening... üò∂ Crime overall
Buck Strunk you are a moron. What other countries have you been to? Right here on this continent there is no border with Canada. No wall. No fence. In Europe there are no walls or fences either. Only in very few places are there walls.  Wake up folks. Read. Educate yourself.
Buck Strunk your borders aren‚Äôt open... and they wouldn‚Äôt be if a wall fails to suffice. do you even look anything up or get your info straight from the hog?
Buck Strunk your president needs you immediately  volunteer for the wall protect our borders give him your money go go
Buck Strunk your statement is factually incorrect
Buck Strunk üôÑ hmm is there a fence in Mexico? Hmm is there a wall on Canadian border hmm you mean all countries have a wall around them. Orange Kool-Aide.
Buck Strunk üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying too!!
Buck Strunk, not true, the USA border has never been 'open'.    Except the one square mile , The Vatican, has no continuous fence/wall.
Buck Strunk.  Who, beside trump and fox news told you the lie that the U.S. has "open border." The fact is we don't so stop spreading lies.
Buck Strunk. Do you think all of the other 194 countries in the world are surrounded by 30' walls? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Buck-  We don‚Äôt  have  open  borders  and  despite  what  the  lying  dimwit  in the  White House  says,  the  Democrats  are  not  in  favor  of  open  borders.
Buddy Phillips Nancy Pelosi does and protestors hopped her fence proving border walls don't work.
Buddy Phillips false equivalence. Move on.
Buddy Phillips only to stop my dog from escaping....
Buddy Phillips you red neck get a life you loser
Buddy Phillips, better question: How many of us anti-wall people only have gates or fences on *one side* of our yards?

Build the wall !! Americans deserve to be protected by this wall. I saw on our local news that now deaths caused by drugs now passes death by car accidents, drownings, general accidents. There is a drug problem in this country and the wall will slow the drugs coming into this country. Building the wall will keep a lot of bad people from coming into this country, etc. Border agents have seen first hand all the issues of bad people, drugs, etc all trying to come into this country. They have told the President, Congressmen, News people, etc. Mr. President Trump, stand your ground, build the wall, keep America safe!
Build the wall . Everyone is worried about them tunneling under big deal easy to solve that problem Ever seen the pic with the wall and the water with the gators.  If there is any good coal or rock in the ground there just let the mines come in and strip mine just off the line 300+ ft deep hell they will even pay the government for the land no need to pay them to do the work. Then fill with water tunneling problem solved.

Bull, you don't know Jack about anything but ripping people off. Where is your secretary of defense. Oh, that's right, he's quit or gotten fired like the rest of your cabinet. You're such a Bozo.
Bulld the wall using this Mr Trump Public Law No. 85-804, codified at 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 1431-35 (Supp. IV 1998), grants to the President the authority to authorize any agency which exercises functions in connection with the national defense to enter into contracts or into amendments or modifications of contracts, and to make advance payments, without regard to other applicable legal provisions whenever such action would facilitate the national defense. 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 1431. The legislative history of the statute indicates that it may also be used as the basis for making indemnity payments under certain government contracts.

But Fox News toldz him dey waz?!
But I though Mexico was going to pay for the wall...
But Mr. President you said Mexico would pay for the wall and not spuriously through savings from the replacement for NAFTA. Remember your promise.
But just the southern boarder and who cares about tsa checking people flying in and out of our country?
But let's not pay the TSA, air traffic controllers and the Coast Guard so we can build an ineffective wall. (that will never, ever be built) Great job defending the country!
But not a wall!   Border security, yes of course, not a wall, and definitely not this wall, this clusterfuk shutdown  for a chunk of red meat tossed out to your rabid base so you can guarantee their blind unwavering support in your bid for 46!?
But not the lives of the actual people you have been elected to represent? Got it. You're a cancer and I cant wait until you are removed.
But only with words and money god forbid he would actually join up when he was younger...all mouth no guts
But our National Security is at Risk and giving Putin our National Secrets!
But we're not being attacked. Mexico and Canada are our allies, in spite of your many attempts to antagonize them. They have not declared war on us.  If you want to spend billions on defending our nation, spend it on effective, evidence-based ways to treat drug addiction. Spend it on mitigating and adapting to climate change.
But what we really need is protection from the likes of you people.
But you are doing the opposite. Poll today 57% not voting for you in 2020. living in Texas, no emergency except worrying about my retirement funds as the economy plunges into a contraction. Way to hurt the economy by billions of dollars. We as a country need to demand NO MORE Government Shutdowns. Run the branches as intended.
But you become IN Fucking SANE!!!!!
But you yourself dodged fighting and defending your country. Your a piece of üí©.  Always will Be you asshat
Bwahahaha. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Bwahahahahaha!!  Talk about obvious statements...EVERYONE agrees we need border security.  What we don‚Äôt need is your cost-ineffective wall, Donny.  Agree to the bipartisan deal already passed by Congress so your shutdown does not completely destroy our economy.  Just give it up now and reopen our government!!!  Trump doubles down on border wall, as polls show voters turning against his shutdown strategy  https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doubles-down-on-border-wall-as-polls-show-voters-turning-against-his-shutdown-strategy

CM Garner  really cause trump was broke in the 2000‚Äôs and Putin bought condos off him for 12 times the worth and inbelzed money to Trump to the tune of 1/2 a billion dollars ~ he‚Äôs bailed him out not only once but twice ~ we have a Russian in the White House ~ even Nixon hated dictators and communist ~ Trumps a TrAitor ~ Putin‚Äôs puppet ~
CM Garner , you do know our president is crooked, Right? You do know trump is Putin's puppet? Right? You are aware that most of the people around trump  are getting arrested for real crimes, Right? How much more do you need, and just last night Giuliani finally told the truth about Russia and trumps campaign.  So it's only a short matter of time before the rest of the truth about out criminal treasonous president comes out.
CM Garner I get it, you're a Russian bots, paid to post propaganda. You even have lovely pictures of that russian POS murder  Putin on your Facebook page.  Facebook has confirmed that all those bogus/fake  news pages about Hillary  during the election were in fact fake,  paid for by the Russians.  Drop dead you commie bastard.

Charlie Daboub  it could have if those Rinos such as,mccain werent such con artists
Charlie Daboub If he used exec powers it be in the courts for another 30 years.  I've wondered on several 'situations' and if our legislatures were only half doing their jobs we would all be better off.  But there are few legislators out there, just a bunch of avaricious party sycophants.
Charlie Daboub Yes I do,,but sure his plan was to show how Un american the Dems are !!!
Charlie Daboub and what did your rising star occassional-cortex say they were?? Oh yeah, president, house and Senate.. lol üòÄ..
Charlie Daboub damn here I go again having to explain how the voting process works if a bill passes the House goes to Senate in the Senate the bill will needs 60 votes to pass and the majority only has 51 now can you figure out the answer as to how many more votes it will need to pass and from what side.
Charlie Daboub liar
Charlie Daboub please learn the voting process.
Charlie Daboub that's an easy one.... to build the wall requires funds. Since we have 3 or 4 rino's it was blocked. Trump even stated he would be ok with it not getting approved in 2018 but he would put up a fight for it in 2019..... hence, we are here and he isn't rolling over like the way republicans have been known to do for the last 20 years.  Let me know if you need anymore schooling.......
Charlie Daboub that‚Äôs not how appropriations work, idiot
Charlie Daboub you are welcome sir!!!
Charlie Daboub you do realize it took 10 Democrats from the Senate to pass any Bill that included money for the Wall. The Democrats refused to work with the Republican Senators, not counting the several RINOS in the Republican Party who also refused to vote for the Wall. I have never understood why the RINOS are even in the Republican Party other than to help the Democrats block real Conservative Bills. These are some of the reasons why the Wall was not built in the last two years.
Charlie Daboub you realize that he needs the Democrat‚Äôs support to fund the wall right? And you realize that the Democrats and Republicans and our last handful of presidents could have also built it, and done other things, but failed to do so. And they claimed they were in support of it until Trump got elected. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è He has done what he can so far with it.
Charlie Daboub, Honestly no.. I'm just saying I think a good idea...
Cheap fast and dirty, President Trump... first 10 miles inside the border is a temp military base... new rules, no cost... What happens when you trespass on a base without authorization? No Congress needed, executive order... done and done
Chemtrails, Laser Blaster, Muslims Trojan Horse....the Wall.
Cheryl A Flood I know I dont like fat girls
Cheryl Steffen I rest my case.
Cheryl Steffen You are a divider. Keep on working for the Russians.
Cheryl Steffen You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress.
Cheryl Steffen your president needs you immediately Volunteer for the wall protect our borders give him your money Go go
Cheryl you needed to spell check as Mr Trump has been Putin first. :P
Cheyenne Swift What are you talking about?
China Marie Elam your comment was so fkn stupid everyone in here is slightly dumber for having read it.
Chip Hughes was almost 6$ hereüòê
Chris Crisis Campbell as if trump can control who does and doesn't support him. The fact that you can't see through the manipulation tells me you really shouldn't even have the right to an opinion much less a vote.
Chris Crisis Campbell the DEMOCRAP LIBERALS that's WHO!!!!!!!!
Chris Jackson Trump 2020, and I hope you snowflakes melt.
Chris Jackson Trump has six more years to trigger liberals just hang in there big guy.
Chris Jackson Wait to see what freedoms you have after these idiotic new Democrats tweak things.
Chris Jackson You probably voted for the communist party.
Chris Jackson finish the Wall and take it all the way to Canada sounds like a good idea to me .
Chris Jackson you must be one dumb person if you think I'm a liberal and if you think a Wall for border security is also dumb you might be a socialist üêñ Democrat with no common sense .
Chris Lonas he's not doing anything you goof! I thought Trump was the deal maker? More like a real faker!
Chris Ng A house without walls ? What would hold up the roof?
Chris Ng tRump says climate change isn't real! Why oh why is he spending million to build a sea wall around his Russian financed Mar A Largo golf course???????
Chris Reed ... you‚Äôre ....
Chris Reed I hope you get an excruciating beat up from an illegal Mexican immigrant, then we'll see.

Christopher Goodwin I thought so too.... even the tie is proper length.  ..lololol...
Christopher Goodwin! YOU ARE REAL IDIOT.
Chuck Owen - it's just the way I feel and I'm sorry it upsets you.  I don't think Trump wants to negotiate.  He wants a win to satisfy his base.  He will only accept what he demands.  Both houses voted unanimously before Christmas for a CR to keep the government open and continue debate on border security.  Trump did an about face.  Now McConnell won't even bring it up for a vote unless Trump gets his way.  He IS using American workers as pawns to sway public opinion.  It looks like extortion to me.  Of course the Democrats could  stop it by giving the extortionist what he wants; all or nothing.
Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi should both be impeached, the President is making a very reasonable and fully justifiable request for the security of our border and OUR country, we have established laws and there‚Äôs no reason why we have to negotiate with our representatives to get them to enforce established laws on immigration, if they feel they can‚Äôt enforce our immigration laws or help the president to do the same then they both should leave the government of the AMERICAN PEOPLE and move to Mexico to further represent their compadres, their obstruction borders treason and at a minimum it‚Äôs childish to the point of mental instability
Chuck and Nancy are so anti wall/barrier/fence but someone should ask them if they‚Äôve ever even visited the border to witness the struggle first hand. Going to say that answer is no.
Cindy Bock dumbasses
Cindy Sue no illegal immigrants do not get social security. Your so clueless! They pay their bills, they buy things, they work, they eat.  Just how do you think anyone that lives in America gets out of all taxes, work, and bills?   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/20/trumps-false-claim-that-undocumented-immigrants-collect-social-security-benefits/?utm_term=.b87654fbfa1b
Cindy Sue they don't care. They will argue to a brick wall that anchor babies (15k plus if tax payer pays for birth) free healthcare (worth $400+ a mo.), Gov assistance (welfare $300+ per family member a mo.), public schools (7k plus a year per child) doesn't cost us that much.  Over 200 billion a year is just to far fetched...rrrrright.
Cindy Sue wrong about 11,000,000 illegal immigrants are currently in America only about 55% are Mexican but chump wont tell you that. Chump does not mention any illegal immigrants that have white skin.
Citizens are responding to the mess that your government shutdown is causing.  At our local international airport donations are being received to aid Federal workers who are not being paid.  Your shutdown is shameful.

Colorado‚Äôs crime rate is growing faster than most of the country. We are a sanctuary state. We are paying a high price. We need security.

Congratulations God trump card
Congratulations Mr President. I am a citizen of Brazil and big fan of your administration. God bless you and the american people!
Congress is like a herd of cats. Have you ever tried herding cats?
Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
Congressional Budget Office reported spending of $590 billion for defense. You Mr Trump have the border patrol working without pay. You Mr Trump have the Coast Guard working without pay.
Conservatives don't want illegal immigrants to come in because they fear they'll take jobs, receive taxpayer assistance, and challenge the dominance of white Protestant culture. (Correct me if I'm wrong.)  Progressives don't want families to die in the desert, be separated and put into cages, or live in fear in the only country they've ever known. (Again, correct me if I'm wrong.)  This "debate" is really becoming a cold civil war, and it's at a stalemate. Neither side is listening because we both believe the other side is using incorrect facts. I will admit that I truly believe I'm right, but I've run out of tools to make my point, so let's ignore for a moment which side is right or wrong and try instead a new discussion in a very new direction.  Mexicans are leaving their country to escape violence and corruption, and I don't have a solution for that. There are Mexican nationals already living in this country, and because a wall can never stop them, let's leave them out of this discussion, too.  The new immigrants are coming here for economic opportunity, and I think that's an easier point to address. They wouldn't HAVE economic opportunity if there weren't willing employers.  Catching those employers is very challenging, and that gigantic challenge requires a bold solution. Let's reward whistle-blowers with citizenship. Seriously. With such a rule in place, nobody in this country could ever again hire more than one undocumented immigrant without getting caught. No worker could ever again be exploited for less-than-minimum wage and suffer OSHA-violating standards because of their citizenship status. No American job could ever again be replaced with a position that cheats the rules.
Considering that roughly a third if the populous believes you are a great President, maybe we should cease...j/s.
Continue to fight for the United States, don't back down Sir, don't ever back down!!!...  Continue to invite the democratics every morning to negotiate and tell us every evening if they show up.  Keep the American Public informed Publicly so that all know.  Keep up the fight, make the Congress take responsibility for their actions.  I am a federal employee and am willing to go through this with you, Stay the Course Mr. President.
Continue to stand fast. Border security is vital. Thank you for ignoring the ignorance and selfish interests behind the opposition. That's what true leadership is about, forging ahead in the toughest of times, doing the right thing long before others discern the need.üá∫üá∏

Cynthia Hill yes we can certainly cast the first stone.  We have never cheated on our spouses, so yea.

Dan Rather: ‚ÄúHere's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security.  In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed.  That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent.  You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall.  You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work."

Dave Boyer calls like this, to bybass the Constitution of the United States are inappropriate.
Dave Boyer if he does it he will win a free ticket to impeachment!
Dave Boyer let's get this out of the way.yes I served.my country in vietnam.you complained about immigrants running up hospital bills,well my friend it's the drinks and druggies.that don't have health insurance and run up our premiums.the.reason why Obama's bill mandated all Americans to obtain insurance.deadbeats without insurance use the emergency room as a doctor.
Dave Boyer this is not a dictatorship. Trump cannot build his wall by the issuance of an executive order. He cannot raise or lower taxes. He cannot write laws. Congress under Republican control passed what he wanted for a tax cut. But even McConnell and Ryan did not get him his wall. They had the power, but did not. Because they did not want the wall.  Only Trump wants a wall, with his name on it. And he will starve good government employees and the country's poor retirees to get his way. How can you support that?
Dave Boyer timing is everything

Day 27 of the tRump government shutdown. Trump has a tendency to propose wild ideas out loud and then repeat them before coming to his senses or getting talked off the ledge. An off-the-top-of-our head list: Leaving NATO. Bombing Iran. Death penalty for drug dealers. Birthright citizenship. Firing staff. Firing Mueller. Leaving the World Trade Organization. Blowing up Iranian fast boats in the Persian Gulf. Withdrawing troops and families from South Korea. Nationalizing a 5G network. Withdrawing from Syria, (just to name a few) you saw what happened yesterday. According to the Washington Post President Trump has made 6,420 false or misleading claims. That‚Äôs the President of the U.S. Let me say that AGAIN ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the President of the UNITED STATES‚Äù We‚Äôre living in the shameless society, where accountability and apology are just white flags for the weak.

Dear Americans and friends, I believe, I believe, Donald Trump is just an ignorant flunky for wealthy special interests in government and in health  care and  that they are bankrupting our future for their wealth. He is deceiving us with the republican Congress and protecting special interests in health care and special interests in general. They are paying lawmakers for their support and complicity. He is not helping in his terrible immigration with his super rude noise; he is hiding and protecting wealthy and selfish interests at the expense of everyone else. The swamp has given Donald Trump directions not to bother them in their money making activities and he is obedient to them and going after defenseless poor people, refugees that need mercy and a humane chance as a ruse to deceive we the people. 	We are being badly governed in his cruel immigration hoax while he is being patted on the back for deceiving the middle class and helping the wealthy lobbies. As proof I offer humble Canada and that they are not as corrupt and arrogant as our non humble elected officials.  	What is the answer but to vote these carpetbagger republicans out of office and never to support Captain Ahab again!
Dear Dems, Please stop living life la vida loca, quit wasting our tax dollars and get your stupid asses back to work!
Dear Donald J. Trump I am sorry to inform you that due to the shutdown, we the people cannot afford the extra security for you to go to your golf resort in Florida.......see you when you open the country!
Dear Madame Speaker:  Due to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate. I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown. Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.  I look forward to seeing you soon and even more forward to watching our open and dangerous Southern Border finally receive the attention, funding, and security it so desperately deserves!  Sincerely,  Donald Donald J. Trump

Dear Mr President do not cave to Nancy Plousy she is out to get you we are behind you 1000%.
Dear Mr. President,  Why do we continue to produce so much rhetoric about illegal immigration, without truly recognizing the root cause of the problem.  Th major reason we have so many illegal immigrants is because these people are desperate to find a better life for themselves and their families.  Why build a wall?  This is an ancient idea that had a specific purpose in mind.  The Great China Wall was built to ward off intruders from the north that were warriors on horseback.  Our intruders from the south are not warriors.  They are a desperate people lookimg for relief from a life of extreme hardship.  They are more apt to be a people armed with a shovel and maybe a Boro.   They will start to dig tunnels as soon as the wall is being erected.  If we were to establish an economy based project that would benifit both countries it would be more beneficial.  I would propose a system of reservoirs along the Rio Grand River with pumping stations in the mountains to pump the water up and over the continental divide to flow through a series of reservoirs on the border south of New Mexico and Arizona.  A wide and deep canal could also be established at the southern border of California.  This system could produce hydroelectric power, could use windmills to pump the water up, could use the water for irrigation in a very arid desert on both sides of the border and could provide a better source of water for fighting the south west wildfires.  This project could generate an economic boom for both sides of the border, and could be accomplished in a state of cooperation with our neighbors to the south.
Dear Mr. President... I have been informed that Mr Barr "supports"  "Red Flag Laws"..... these laws are UnConstitutional and he should know that and respect our rights according to the Bill of Rights  especially the 2 and 4th as it applys to this issue.  Please do not support such Constitutional attacks on our Rights!
Dear Mr. President‚Ä¶please bring all of the Angel Families to the State of the Union address. Tell each individual story of horror, sadness and loss of a loved one. Go into detail. Then have the family stand holding the picture. When you are done with all the families, share all of the staggering facts you were told by border security agents. Crossings of people from countries other than Central America, Gang members, drug seizures, deaths from overdose; go into detail because most Americans are not aware of the true numbers. Then ask ‚Äúif what I just said is true will are brave border patrol officers please stand to affirm those numbers as accurate‚Äù. Then on National TV declare the National Emergency and build the damn WALL. We are behind you 110%. Thank You for saving our country and trying to repair the devastating intentional damage caused by the previous administration. God Bless you and your entire family.
Dear President Donald J. Trump, You do realize that all of these Muslims in America will eventually try to murder us .. because their Quran instructs them to do exactly that?
Dear President Trump, please just ignore that old biddy Nancy!! Ignoring someone is often the best policy and the ultimate insult! Give your State of the Union address! Maybe the Democrats will stay home! Build our wall as promised!!!
Dear President, can you please please defend my 4 yo daughter from charged Russian fugitive pedophile who is charged in his country of citizenship Russia for sexual assault of a toddler. Yet in Richmond County New York family court he is fighting me for custody of my daughter the child he abused!!! I need you assistance please! And investigation of the judge as well. The judge has been ignoring all evidence of sexual assault and is now ignoring the fact that the father is charged fugitive with warrant for his arrest worldwide.
Dear Sir! Having taken a recent vote, at that time 71% are in favor of  what you're doing, and the others favor the Dems .It's apparent you are constantly referring this as being a National Security issue,  and apparently have the means of getting the sufficient amount to complete it,  Don't talk yourself out.. We see  Dems digging their grave and will become all the more obvious now they' have the House.
Dear Sir: I agree with you wholeheartedly, however, it is the people you serve to protect that are being penalized. Call off the shut down. Call a National Emergency, if you must. But get this resolved QUICK!
Dear Trumpanzees,  Please don't conflate hate with patriotism.
Dear god no, why?
Dear mr. President I defend your policies to a point I support you until you go against your oath of office shall not be infringed upon means exactly that please reconsider your opinion unread flag laws shall not be infringed upon is in our constitution not take them and some poor busted up veteran can't afford to get his rights back or her rights back is not right
Dear my favorite President of all time. I am a tiny speck in  Oregon you will never know. I wish I could look you in the eye and thank you for the strength and intelligence you have shared for the USA. I have your back here, because you prove you have ours every dayüí™ jüá±üá∑
Debbie Hudson
Debbie Hudson Debbie, first of all, open the government to stop hurting Americans by holding them hostage.  Then, analyze the border to identify the various issues associated with various segments of the border. Take the segments or issues presenting the greatest risk. Review those segments or issues to ID the best solution approaches. Fund those solution approaches. Then iterate thru lower priorities until the pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  There are big problems that a wall will do nothing to solve: 1) most of the illegal drugs that enter our great country across the southern border come in on vehicles driving thru existing, managed and legal ports of entry, 2) the next most prevalent entry method is via tunnels under existing wall, 3) about 40% of folk currently in our country illegally came in with valid visas but overstayed those visas (these folk come from all over the world) and 4) it is reported that currently, the visa overstay issue is contributing higher volumes of people in country illegally than the volume of people crossing across the southern border.  Trump is actually hurting the cause of enhancing border security by using the false siren call of ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù. This is both dumb and counterproductive. If he wanted true progress, he would lead the process towards smart and effective enhancements in a prioritized way.  Debbie, I watched Trump state he would be happy and proud to shut it down. I watched Trump state he would own the shutdown, completely.  I watched this on live TV - no ‚Äúfake news‚Äù spin involved.  Trump had signaled he would sign the funding bills. McConnell had the Senate vote on the funding bills based upon that understanding.  That same night, extreme right wing media personalities criticized Trump. Trump caved to the criticism (so much for being strong).  Then the House added Trump‚Äôs money into their version of the bill and passed it.  Then the shutdown started.  Then, the new House passed the exact same funding bills that had just been passed, almost unanimously, three or so weeks before. Now, McConnell refuses to bring those same bills for a vote in the new Congress, enabling Trump.  Trump is acting IMMORALLY when he hurts over one million Americans as his sole ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù chip.
Debbie Skinner your profile looks like Putins people created it. No facts on where you are from, work, or live. So dont be so quick to label those with opposing views as not being real. I worked for 51 years, paid my taxes and SS. Raised my kids to all work and pay taxes. I oppose the wall, support border security, am for more accessible ports of entry and better screening,  and am torally against the gov't shutdown. I blame Donald Trump for creating it, and Mitch McConnell for prolonging it by not allowing bipartisan legislation that has passed the house to even be put up for debate and a possible vote. He is now the biggest obstacle to reopening the government, not Shumer, not Pelosi.
Deborah Molta Griffin,  Bc he doesn't need The  Democratic Party to Control  him Nor Speak for him!  People do have there own opinion, either Deal with it or F**k Off!
Declare a national emergency and #BuildTheWall Mr. President.  Pelosi and the Democrats don't care about us.
Declare a national emergency üö®Mr President you are doing a great job,keep up the good worküá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Declare a national emergency, build the wall and be done with it.  What's the hold up??
Declare a state of emergency already. Show them all what GOP backbone really is!!!
Declare an emergency and start the Wall!
Declare the emergency, build that wall & work on getting those 2 clowns out of there, I'm sick of this crap with them bullying you for doing what most voters want you to do!
Declare the emergency. Build it and end this. Only way!
Defend against Russian interference, punk! Traitor
Defend it against the liberals 1st ...
Defend or destruct
Defend our borders, sir!  Put up flat screens in Congress to "loop" all the Demo support for secure borders (in very recent years)............play those remarks non-stop and even during SOTU address so cnn can broadcast truth for a change.
Defend our borders. We stand with you. MAGA! üá∫üá∏
Defend our nation from Putin's Russia
Defend them and do what you said and have Mexico write that check and stop asking us for a useless wall with 1,000 holes.

Defending America!!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Defending our border doesn‚Äôt require a wall.   Defending our country from YOU will require a wall. A prison wall.
Defending our borders does not only mean having a wall. It also means ensuring we are not attacked by foreign enemies that compromise our democracy. In short your collusion and hidden discussions with Putin are a far greater threat than refugees wanting to be part of our country.
Defending our president is protecting America!
Defending the borders does not mean a 30‚Äô high wall. How did that work out for East Germany?
Defense and a useless wall are not the same thing
Defense by shutdown- your logic is nonsense
Defense from what?
Defense is how you win gamesüëç Do your thing Mr. President.
Defense of our nation is most important?? 5 TIMES! Not 1 but 5 times you used your privilege to dodge the draft. Sit your orange ass down n stfu.
Defining moment boss.. Stay the course... Secure the funds.. Hold out til you get it.. The tides are shifting.. The whole world is watching America's President willing to do Annnnything to protect our Country!!! Proud to say Trump IS my President! We are with you & will be in 2020! Imwithhim8!! #theotherwomen #walkaway Peace
Definitely agree. Our freedom are taken for granted.
Deflection from trump‚Äôs treason
Demagogue
Democraps have went all in on globalism and the destruction of this country.   Make them cry again. Give them nothing.   üá∫üá∏
Democrats = #1 enemy of the United States.
Democrats I love America is made in China....Trump all the way...
Democrats Pelosi and Schumer, are Desperate to try and Stop President Trump, from telling the Truth about the government shut down and the Wall with Mexico. Senator, Ted Cruz: https://twitter.com/BlazeTV/status/1085907090957307909?s=20
Democrats are against the wall for one reason....... they put their hate for President Trump and their two year long temper tantrum above everything else. They will sacrifice the country and American lives to push their agenda of hate and obstruction.   Democrats are so desperate. They will do anything to hide facts that don‚Äôt fit their agenda.   Funny how the Democrats don‚Äôt want the non citizens counted on the census.   Teachers in California on strike because of low pay, lack of supplies and overcrowded classrooms. How many of the students in those over crowded classrooms are illegal immigrants? State of California can‚Äôt pay teachers a fair wage but they are a Sanctuary State and want free healthcare for all illegal immigrants.   Remember a few years ago when the Democrats wanted a ‚Äúfence / wall‚Äù and voted to fund it. Funny how they are against it now because President Trump wants the wall.   Remember a few years ago when Obama declared there was a ‚ÄúHumanitarian Crisis‚Äù on the southern  border. Funny how Democrats now says the ‚ÄúHumanitarian Crisis‚Äù on the southern border is a fake / made up Crisis.   How are those Democrat policies working out?   It really takes a special kind of stupid to still support the Democrats.
Democrats are aiming for that
Democrats are like sperm cells only 1 in 10 million has a chance to become a human being
Democrats are not democratic. They are a bunch of diaper babies and have proven this time and time again.
Democrats are not only promising free health care for Americans, they‚Äôre promising it for illegal immigrants too! Sure, it‚Äôs easy to sell free stuff as a policy to drive up your voter base, but in reality, nothing is free. Someone always has to pay for it.
Democrats are now an adversary of the U.S. and like any enemy of the U.S. they care nothing about National Security and Public Safety..
Democrats are proving themselves Communists more everyday.  Stand for America President Trump.  MAGA!!
Democrats are the problem, haven't worked for Americans in a very long time.
Democrats aren't afraid the wall won't work. They're afraid the wall WILL work- thereby stopping the drug money they are currently receiving! #TRUMP2020 #MAGA #America1STüíØ
Democrats did refuse to work with our President on the border wall before the shut down.... REMEMBER. Now the talking heads and certain congressmen are encouraging to reopen the government and be given three weeks for Republicans and Democrats to work on a solution? Notice how they all say border security and avoid the word wall, barrier ..... there is a reason why they skillfully use language to deceive and/or give false hope.  N. Pelosi  and C. Schumer will negotiate with giving 1.6B for border security but the wall is not included( or I forgot she did say 1 dollar to the wall) and there you have it folks. The Democrat Party for two years have made it clear in their talk and walk that they are the party of hate and resist President Donald J. Trump and those that voted for him. What honest person with common sense believes the controlled house of Democrats will abandon their hate and resistance for the next two years? There talk is cheap and their walk shows Americans they can not be trusted. Majority of "We The People" demand a strong, big border wall. Schumer and Pelosi don't give a flip about American lives..... all they care about is political power over national security and over the life of Americans. Sorry Senator L. Graham but you are wrong on this one...‚Ä¶ Democrats ought to be able to work this out with the Republicans before the government reopens if you truly care for Americans as they claim they are so concerned. Stay strong Mr. President for majority of "We The People" are standing strong for the protection of our children and grandchildren.
Democrats hate Trump more than they love America. Thank you President Trump for listening to the people! MAGA - #America1STüíØ
Democrats have ceased to be Americans. They only care about illegal aliens for their voting base.
Democrats now are hard headed...weird they wanted the Wall all along...it is all about the votes I guess so.
Democrats turning their backs on their own constituents, the poor, the working class...... Well the American ones.  Only a Democrat would stick their neck out for everyone but Americans.  Those already here who need government assistance in any form should be opposed to open borders. They will be bankrupting the very programs they depend on and stealing your children‚Äôs seats in the classroom.
Demos dont want to be a nation,how sad is that?
Dems are responsible at this point.  Their hate for Trump is so deep, they're willing to open our borders and let anyone and everyone in.
Denise Foot  From a person with land all of the way up to the border...  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10210424874452837&id=1672964713
Denise Foot I didn't go only by what Trump said. Can't you research anything? You just laugh at everything instead.  There's 700 miles of border wall/fence already there!  Are you totally ignorant or what?  They have been repairing sections and replacing some too. Nancy Pelosi said it when she tried to deny it!  She said...."no new wall is being built, they are repairing sections of what's there and replacing some."   REPLACING some!  You are out of touch and think that laughing at things is rational.
Denise Foot I'm not wallowing in lies from anyone. YOu are na√Øve. I know exactly what's been going on in California for decades. I don't need anyone to tell me that.  I don't have to "read" anything about what I said either.  The previous governor Jerry Brown and the new one, Gaven Newsom do nothing but ruin California and if you can't see that , then maybe you should go there and learn a few things.  I don't need Donald Trump or anyone else but the people who actually live it in that state to tell me what those stupid politicians have allowed for over 30 years. My statements are true. YOU are na√Øve.  And don't call me a fool when you obviously know much of nothing about the situation in California. Take a trip and get outside of your own comfort zone, lady. Try learning real things and talk to real people.  YOur term "vanity wall" is a media term.  Don't you have your own words?
Denise Foot Laughing at the facts? I see you are just ignorant. Good luck with that.  Have you ever been to California or Texas?
Denise Foot Quit sniffing glue.
Denise Foot They did fund the wall last year, dear.  They are using that money right now by repairing and replacing parts of the 700 miles of  wall / fencing that is already there.  They ALL voted for it not so long ago. YOu should keep up on current events.
Denise Foot Those aren't lies.  You don't get out much or know many people?  Immigration has been a problem for decades. Illegal migration is created by politicians and always has been. It's a huge problem.   All that California governor is going to have is slave labor and wealthy people and an overpopulation of poor people.  Ever see the homeless situation in southern California?
Denise Foot What ever you smoke is way way way to strong for you #remove Denise
Denise Foot You get your words from mainstream media. It couldn't be more obvious. Who are your experts?  "vanity wall?" And please tell us what is the "plan" for border security?  The politicians you trust so much have created the situation at that border and they don't wish to fix it!  Don't be so na√Øve.
Denise Foot another ignorant liberal POS!!!
Denise Foot diversion doesn‚Äôt work   You stated above that Trump is lying about immigration. Please elaborate. I already have the videos from the borders of San Diego and El Paso
Denise Foot liar.
Denise Foot lying ? Please tell us
Denise Foot please elaborate. Including facts supported by evidence
Denise Foot pure propaganda !

Denise Scott your president needs you immediately Volunteer for the wall protect our borders give him your money Go go go
Department of Homeland Insecurity is working here
Derek Crow-Brown WHY didn't trump ask for 5.1 Billion in his budget?  You know the one that he presented, asking for 1.5 billion,  that was passed and ready for him to sign?  So why did it becone an EMERGENCY after FOX and conservative Talking Heads said to NOT negotiate?  WHY  didn't trump pass the funding when he had both Houses and just needed a couple of votes?  WHY didn't the Republicans negotiate for trump with the few Democrats?  WHY after 2 years has he decided to ransom the American people for a Wall that is obsolete?

Did I write that that didn't happen? ( no I did not ) . I am actually over you peoples heads but the insults always come even though most of you don't really know anything. Just how to attack with emotions.
Did the democraps take a different oath of office to ruin and disrespect Americans? Apparently so !
Did trump lose weight?  And his shoulders are much broader......he must have been working out.....wait...I think he's taller too.....
Did you get the ok from Putin before you shut down the government?
Did you know ü§î 500 million dollars of US tax payer money went to fund a border wall for the country of Jordan. This was approved under the Obama administration with bi partisan support from Congress. I guess border walls only work for other countries? ü§î

Then sorry son of a bitches called the Democrats need to either retire or just quit because they aren‚Äôt helping this problem any more better than it already is getting.
Donald Trump‚Äôs companies have reached a ten year high in the number of foreign workers that they have recruited for low wage, unskilled jobs at Trump companies.  Trump has long campaigned on restricting immigration to the United States.  The Trump Organization requested and received at least 192 visas for foreign workers in 2018, according to Department of Labor data. That number appears to be the highest for the company going back to at least 2008 and likely much earlier, based on public records.  TPM, which reviewed the raw Labor Department information files.Those visas were almost entirely for the type of low-skilled foreign workers that Trump has claimed drive down American wages. Cooks, servers, housekeepers and farmworkers make up a large chunk of the Trump Organization‚Äôs requests, most of them making between $10 and $15 hourly.
Donald j humperdick hahahhahaahhaha asshole
Donald tell the truth, you really believe your most important duty is to line your pockets with cash.
Donald, admit it... the Washington bureaucrats live on negotiations, and you are no match.

Donna Davis Takes one to know one.
Donna Davis obviously you don't know God.  He loves all people. Even haters like you.
Donna Park The original Fathers who wrote the Constitution & later some amendments, wrote that good sound protection of the country was important. They also said that a strong defense would protect & Americans would be safe. Damages would not be by "External" attack, but by "Internal" decisions. Yes, Democrats appear uninterested in USA border security.. & only the illegals. Citizens are not their priority..it is illegals votes & the power they will gain.

Donna Snyder you‚Äôre talking union benefits while supporting Trump? You do know the Republicans are anti union with all their right-to-work, wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing policies, right? Please google right-to-work legislation. Find out what it is you are supporting. You may be surprised.
Donna Snyder, we have a Coast Guard station where I live along the California Coast along with several military installations. We have a credit union who is offering loans interest-free for those affected, the county animal shelter (no-kill) that's offering free food for pets, and so many other organizations helping those in need.  Ventura County went through two wildfires in two years and is now dealing with heavy rain and flooding. We got through it before and we'll do it again. People will always help.
Donnie  does that  include  our  northern  border  or  just  the  one  where  the  brown  people live  ?
Dont back down homie
Dont back down. Declare a national emergency,  and do the job the unamerican democrats wont do. They should be the ones NOT GETTING PAID during a shutdown.
Dont fold Mr. PRESIDENT!
Dont get suckered like Reagan did!! No deals until you get your wall!! You will win this!!
Dont think you have lost support, we support you and we support the wall 100 percent #MAGA  #KAG
Don‚Äôt always agree with our President on many issues - believe he‚Äôs absolutely RIGHt on this. This is another security measure. Just like cyber threats etc.  These initiatives need to be funded. And by doing so does not make our country less generous.  The generosity of this country is being misused by nefarious folks who are creating a bad name for the good, honest people. Also a wall is better than waging war on people - it doesn‚Äôt kill people and actually creates jobs.  If the Democrats are making this such a big issue then they should stop all this Russian interference talk - lift all the funding to cyber security and other types of security.
Don‚Äôt back down. The patriots of this country stand behind you and are cheering you on
Don‚Äôt cancel the SOTU Mr President. Thank you for everything you‚Äôre doing for Our Country! This is how our country should of been managed for years. But there‚Äôs so much corruption in the system‚Äù that has been covered up, that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt like you! Your bringing out the corruption!  Thank you!
Don‚Äôt cave to the Demoncrats
Don‚Äôt fly. Nobody needs to fly.
Don‚Äôt give in Mr President
Don‚Äôt give in, build that Wall.
Don‚Äôt give in.   We need the border wall!
Don‚Äôt let others enter and dictate your laws ... stand strong on immigration ... and shame on shonky Dems and self interest

You are all talk. Keep giving away your hand and stimulate the enemy.
Drew Mullen , tell that to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who don‚Äôt care about anyone but themselves! Living in their mansions behind gates with bodyguards. They have more than enough room to house illegals. Immigration laws have been in effect a long time, only the liberals have chosen to ignore them.

Drones are now used to fly in drugs by the cartels.
Drones can be deployed at a far less cost than a wall to be climbed and swam around.  Think smarter, evolve with technology not stubborn old ways.  Drones do not have to be paid - do not have to eat and can be your first line of defense.  Keeps our border patrol safer.
Drones, RVs, and ATVs.
Drugs are such a problem in America- I think that everyone has at least 1 person in their family who is or was a drug addict. If you are lucky enough not to have someone you love hooked on drugs then I feel sure you know someone who has a family member that is. That alone is a great enough reason for the border being secure. Not to mention all the murders-child kidnappings and child trafficking. Everyone in this great country of ours should be for the border wall. I don't want to see another young person hooked on drugs much less an adult. It hurts the entire family not just the user. And 90% of the drugs come Thur the border from Mexico.
Drugs comes in via military choppers and vehicles, the wall will be useless, use technology and built a working system where everyone is loyal to the government, you personally tricked and stole from the same American people you want allude to protect, maybe you will be gaining from the wall
Dude. Dumbest quote ever. How is this joker in charge of the free world???
Dumb ineffective wall to climb or fly over, swim or boat around, tunnel under, blast or cut through. Pure ignorance, from ignorant play president. He wants a government shutdown to golf more. Lazy crybaby babbling incoherent corrupt conman prick.

During the civil rights era of the 1960s, Dr. King was fighting the Democrats who stood in the school house doors, turned skin-burning fire hoses on blacks and let loose vicious dogs. It was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower who pushed to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and sent troops to Arkansas to desegregate schools. President Eisenhower also appointed Chief Justice Earl Warren to the U.S. Supreme Court, which resulted in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision ending school segregation. Much is made of Democrat President Harry Truman‚Äôs issuing an Executive Order in 1948 to desegregate the military. Not mentioned is the fact that it was Eisenhower who actually took action to effectively end segregation in the military.
Duval Sotelo hate to break it to you, but the House was mostly Republicans until a few days ago!  The shutdown started in Dec 2018! The Democrats were sworn in to office January 2019! trump said he would take full credit for the shutdown, REMEMBER!  There is NO emergency!  Just trump responding to the conservatives talking heads and FOX Entertainment news! Why didn't he use his "fantastic negotiating skills" (at least that's what he calls them) to talk the few Democrats he needed into voting yes? Because the Republicans didn't want a wall and didn't negotiate in support of it!

Easy to maintain the Hill Of Corruption once they have gotten their feet in the door and dig deep roots.  Term Limits would possibly help, but not the total solution either.  All Secret ORDER OF SOCIETIES, should be banned from our government.  They have no place here.  Just as JFK had stated in his last speech, and then he was assassinated.  He knew full well the dangers of having "100% of the Senate and 90+% of Congress Illuminati Members", for the Illuminati Secret Order Of Society Satanic Worshiping Group is a very threat to our freedom and God Like Way Of Life.  They are the root of evil and corruption and must be drained from the SWAMP entirely.

Emigration is a state of rules and regulations of life in a country, an organization to establish order and security in the community, mainly on the border, that our President focuses on the behavior of the illegal, with a border wall . Families that cross the border using children, knowing that our president does not separate children from their parents, it is right to return to where they came to Mexico or their country, it is unfair that parents have traveled with innocent children, to continue living as illegal immigrants
Emily Meysembourg all past presidents have completed more of their campaign promises than Trump who has only succeeded at tax cuts for the rich and sending our economy spiraling into a recession.

Ever wonder what happened to the border security wall that George W. had funded and Obama claimed completed (only 37 miles not the 700 miles funded)?  So where did that money go and did that wall ever get completed or did that just go into the Dems pocket?
Every Custodian of a Country should have to say this confirmation to his Countrymen, I see nothing wrong with His Excellency President Trump here. Well done.
Every United States President and presidential candidate for the last 30+ years has made the same statement... ‚ÄúWe have a border crisis‚Äù.   Now, President Trump not only makes that statement, but tries to actually do something about it, and the democrats and media claim that he ‚Äúinvented the crisis‚Äù.    BUILD THE WALL!!
Every country in the EU has open borders. Infact most borders are largely open in the absence of war
Every go through the emojis and look at the few laugh and andrybfaces and realize they are all foreigners lmao
Every month of shut down means a decrease in the economy growth of 0.15%, which means alround 1-2% decrease over a year, which is more or less the growth rate of the industrialized countries in this world, not to speak about almost a million state employees taken as hostages ;-(. They do not know, how to pay their bills and how to buy their food and sorry to say, I know what that feels like. The trade war with China also already impacts severly the economic growth of leading US companies like Apple, Tesla and many others as they are loosing market share in one of the most important arrising markets, China. Please let's stop trade wars, populistic nationalistic politics and let's work together with your strong partners in Europe, Asia and worldwide on the real problems ahead, not for walls, weapons and dirty old-fashioned, enviromental doutable technologies like coal.
Every single country in the EU has open borders. Ever heard of the Schengen agreement dumbass??
Every single person in this country should be for strict borders , if your not your not a American ! A country without borders is not a country !
Everybody claimed to care so much about vets! Yet this president is willing to starve existing servicemen for a wall.  Yet Flint Michigan doesn‚Äôt have clean drinking water today.
Everybody on the face of the earth wants  safety, so Trump must be presenting himself wrong to make democrats rebel against him.
Everybody wants to defend our borders, President Doofus. We just want to be smart about it. That leaves you out.
Everyday you say the border is critical to our security. The border this and the border that. Are we moving forward with the border wall or not? I support the protection of the US. Im not necessarily against the wall or for it. Let's just get something done. Rep are blaming the Dems and the Dems are blaming the Rep. Its like everyone is in kindergarten. Figure this out President Trump.
Everyone Republicans Democrats independence non-affiliates want to security at our borders which we do have‚Ä¶ We need to enhance manpower and technology‚Ä¶ Some portions of the already there wall may be repaired and extended‚Ä¶ But the big question of the day is you have been presented proposals that you said you would sign and when you receive them you did not‚Ä¶ Liar‚Ä¶ The $1.7 billion you were given last year for the wall was not utilize‚Ä¶ This is just an ego hoax‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt wait till they LOCK U UP

FORMER CIA DIRECTOR AGREES DONALD TRUMP IS A 'CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER' TO U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY BY TIM MARCIN ON 1/16/19  John Brennan, former director of the CIA, on Tuesday agreed with an assessment that President Donald Trump presented a "clear and present danger" to the United States's national security.   (Does he agree with former Department of Justice counterintelligence head David Laufman, who assessed that Trump was a "clear and present danger" to U.S. national security?)  "I know David Laufman well. I worked with him for many years and have tremendous respect for his intellect as well as for his judgment," said Brennan. "A number of people have been saying for quite some time that the actions, and the policies, and the statements that Mr. Trump has been making undermine our national security. So I think David Laufman brought it together in a very crisp and succinct way."  Hayes followed up by pressing for a more direct answer. "So you don't think he's wrong?" the host asked.  "I don't think he's wrong at all, no," Brennan said. "If Donald Trump is thinking about taking the United States out of NATO, the organization that the United States and our European allies have, in fact, formed in order to prevent the Soviet Union's expansion for so many years, and now stands in the way of Russia moving westward. This is something that is just totally mind-blowing, that the president of the United States would actually entertain this notion."  Laufman had earlier told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow that he felt a "moral obligation" to speak out when a Washington Post article reported that Trump had concealed notes and details from a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  ‚ÄúThe notion that the president of the United States would be trying to conceal the details of conversations with the leader of our principal foreign adversary was positively chilling,‚Äù Laufman said.  Trump pushed back against the idea that he was working for Russia, which, The New York Times reported, had been the subject of an FBI inquiry.

First time in history the Dem's don't want to spend money on somethingüò≥
Florence Karfeld who knows best you or the border patrol that has their boots on the ground or maybe you know more than Mark Morgan who was the head of Border Patrol under Obama because he too says we need a wall.
Florence Lake you can say that again.... I do hate him.
Folks write your representatives and ask that they do this...change happens when people speak up !Get rid of Speaker Pelosi and let our country move forward: How to remove Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House: If Pelosi's caucus wants to depose her  , the House Rules allow this to happen. According to Jefferson‚Äôs Manual, a 19th century procedural manual that has been largely incorporated into the House Rules:  A Speaker may be removed at the will of the House, and a Speaker pro tempore appointed.  A resolution declaring the Office of Speaker vacant presents a question of constitutional privilege, though the House has never removed a Speaker. It has on several occasions removed or suspended other officers, such as Clerk and Doorkeeper. A resolution for the removal of an officer is presented as a matter of privilege.
Folks, based on the misspelled and grammatically incorrect posts on Sheldon's page, I'm going to have to "out" him: He's actually one of donald's fake profiles.
Fool we all want protected borders but a wall won't do it. Keep talking to your base that is getting smaller and smaller. Like your hands?
For Demon-crats, voter fraud & illegal votes are their most important duty.
For TWO YEARS the Democrats have done NOTHING - BUT DISRUPT, SUBVERT, and GROW HATE!!! Fact! For TWO YEARS Democrats FOUGHT border Security-at America's PERIL! Fact! For TWO YEARS attacked RACE, Whites, Jews, Men, Family VALUES! Fact! For EIGHT YEARS Previous - the Democrats Stripped the GOV of as many Non-Liberal Leaders in EVERY Branch of Gov! Fact! For TWO YEARS - the Democrats FOUGHT EVERY SINGLE Accomplishment of Pres Trump, while simultaneously SPENDING TENS of $$ Millions investigating Russian Collusion KNOWING Hillary and O'Dippy were BOTH neck deep in corruption, collusion, and SELLING OUT America to PROFIT THEMSELVES! Fact!!! HOW on earth can ANYONE still be so blind as to think for even a moment the Liberals/Democrats have ANY INTENT WHATSOEVER to help ANYONE but THEMSELVES!!??? Fact??? The SWAMP is FIGHTING for their very survival, and have used every tool in despicable efficiency to UNDERMINE "WHAT IS GOOD for OUR COUNTRY! GO Trump!!!
For all the dumb fucks that are okay with illegals breaking the law and flying under the radar why don't you move to Mexico and rot then maybe you'd appreciate his stance on national security and keeping everyone in line instead of cutting in line from those that file for citizenship the right way.

For the love of God we don't have it open border! We have security we had the lowest illegal immigration of all time! The wall is useless as it was a selling point for the simple-minded! And that's the reason why he is sticking with it because if he does not make this happen even the simple-minded won't back him!
For the love of heaven why don't u Trump haters turn your hate into support for the man who's trying to make decisions & pray he makes the right ones for the good of this country. That's what made this country great.!in God we trust & think positive instead of destroying the head.
For this statement I am thankful Mr. President.   TRUMP 2020
For those of you who think a border wall will protect you, y'all are about as dumb as trump thinking it will. Drugs immigrants come in other ways besides Mexico. Most drugs and guns are imported in on boats or planes. Illegal immigrants come the same way lmao so pathetic to think that a wall will prevent it from occurring.
For two years you had both Senate and the House and you thought it best to give your top 1% a $1 trillion tax cut. And now when the House went away your pathetic drama LMAO.
For what?
Forcing people to work, without pay, will help us cease to be a nation
Foreign interference like illegal invaders voting?
Forget doing the SOTU speech in Washington. Do it on the border before appreciative members of the Border Patrol. Or pick any city in the country and do the speech campaign rally style! #bothworkforme

Four Americans died yesterday at ISIS hands. "ISIS has been defeated" trump
Four Americans killed by ISIS in Syria. Now, either you do not know what you are talking about claiming ISIS is defeated or you are a liar. Has your claim of defeating ISIS in Syria caused this killing to prove you are wrong? The security of your armed forces abroard should be as serious as your border security with Mexico.
Frances Hartley so true!
Frank Lapinski Ever heard of the Caucus Room conspiracy? You can blame your own party for the current climate of obstruction.
Frank Lapinski no sir asshole President Trump
Frank Valdez wrong stop watching Fake News brother .
Frankie Pazo  Yes. As long as they come in legally. Not storming the border!!
Fred Shope our media is the immediate threat. China and Russia are just sitting back and waiting for us to destroy ourselves from within. Then they move in without firing a shot. If you happen to be a liberal you are aiding in the process.
Fred Trump, Sr. Congratulations. You raised a fine son in Donald Trump. You instilled in him hard work pays off. He is a very smart man. A kind and caring heart comes easy to him. He says what he thinks and doesn‚Äôt water it down. Just don‚Äôt cross him. He is brilliant in negotiating techniques and World leaders are learning he means business. The USA has never had a business man for our President before. It‚Äôs wonderful and we know he loves us and is working for us when we are sleeping. Our economy has grown and people who had been laid off are back to work. Businesses are caring for their employees and even giving bonuses. There‚Äôs some people who don‚Äôt like him because he is a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù kind of President and he is definitely ‚Äúin charge.‚Äù  He brings with him his beautiful and gracious wife First Lady Melania Trump. She is such an asset to him and the whole world loves her. Children are drawn to her and she is thriving. We have the best chance we have ever had to have a prosperous nation because he brings family that are loyal and talented is so many ways.  He is not liked by everyone because he does things his way, not the way it has been being done. You started him young and he accepted your training. We are a grateful nation and know you would be as proud of him as we are. Prayers daily for President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Second Lady Karen Pence. The Administration is successful even with all the resistance and obstruction from the opposing party. I applaud you for your success and we are blessed to reap the benefits.

Friends. Have you people joined the team Trump yet? Please join, so we become more effective. Thank you.
From 2009 through 2014, there was a net loss of Mexicans. More migrants left the US than came here. Who was President back then?
From Germany , you are my Pr√§sident , help us please .
From VP Agnew‚Äôs one-time lawyer: ‚ÄúAt some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment. The longer the President waits, the more evidence piles up, and the tougher it will be to get a deal. Mueller already has a federal grand jury hearing evidence that just received a six-month extension. The President should make his deal before that body completes its work. The Mueller report may accompany a clutch of Mueller indictments.‚Äù
From a recently retired veteran (USArmy):  I URGE EVERYONE TO STOP VOTING FOR POLITICIANS THAT HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY/FOREIGN POLICY.  THIS IS TOO RECKLESS FOR OUR COUNTRY.  PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED BECAUSE OF POOR DECISIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!  ALSO, NATIONAL SECURITY AFFECTS ALL OF US.  NOT JUST WEALTHY POLITICIANS THAT WORK IN WASHINGTON D.C. AMERICA PLEASE START PAYING ATTENTION TO THE DECISIONS THAT WE ARE PURSUING ABROAD.  I KNOW THAT DOMESTIC POLICIES ARE A PRIORITY. BUT THE PRESIDENCY'S PORTFOLIO IS 50 PERCENT DOMESTIC POLICY AND 50 PERCENT FOREIGN POLICY.  PLEASE DO A BETTER JOB EVALUTING THE CANDIDATE BASED ON THEIR FOREIGN POLICY BACKGROUND AND NOT BASED ON YOUR EMOTIONS.   BY THE WAY, I AM NOT VOTING FOR A CANDIDATE THAT IS WEAK IN NATIONAL SECURITY/FOREIGN POLICY FOR #2020.  I DO NOT CARE ABOUT HOW POPULAR THE CANDIDATE IS.  NO ONE SHOULD OCCUPY THE OVAL OFFICE WITH NO FOREIGN POLICY CREDENTIALS.    AS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY/FOREIGN POLICY.    WE NEED BETTER GLOBAL LEADERSHIP.........CURRENTLY, WE LOOK STUPID ABROAD.  STOP SUPPORTING OR ENABLING (NO ACTION) RECKLESS POLICIES ABROAD.
From day one your emergence as the president was a divine mandate and not by popular demand. We know they don't like you but keep the good work. for if it were to be man power for you to be elected the president you wouldn't near the premises of the White House. No hard feelings just the Good work!!
From time to time it becomes necessary to water the tree of liberty with the blood of traitors.
From your statement it would seem that you are not one of the intelligent ones, right?
Fuc# Nancy pistole and chuck gutter ratscumer. They are holding the country hostage. ASSINATE THEIT ASSES
Fucing loser
Fucking joke.
Fully support you and will return to work when ever my POTUS feels he can get proper work done despite the Dems blocking everything that makes sense for American people.
Fund the wall, Dimms!
Fundamentally, you are a great person whom keeps his promises. Yet, you should understand the implications of the government shut-down. A handful amount of federal workers are struggling disastrously due to your stubbornness, these people need to feed their family everyday .you and I both are well aware of the fact democrats will never approve to fund for your walls. You‚Äôd better come up with a better idea.
Funny I thought it would be bending over for Putin
Funny half the country thought the same of the last uneducated clown of a president Barry Obama.
Funny how all the liberal trolls love to post propaganda that has nothing to do with his post...... Same Ol' crap over and over.... Noone looks at it, or dismisses it for the sewage it is.
Funny how many families are going without food so they can get to work or medicine he thinks this is a joke bc he aint going without I bet he couldn't live one day in the wk of the average citizen therefore has no empathy as to what they are going through open the dam government pay your employees and then discuss the stupid wall......If it was so important than why not do this when you had both the house and congress instead you feed your wealthy friends like the poor lil boy at school who had no friends until he bought them
Funny how the government workers arent getting paid.... Similar to the many contract he defrauded trying NOT to pay the workers on his projects.. this is the dummies of middle americas doing chasing a reality star.. idiots
Funny how we've been a nation prior!!
Further, none of us can change yesterday. It's today and tomorrow we must deal with. Build it now, and take away the magnets.
Fyi they take care of themselves for the most part. They work and pay over 300 billion in taxes.   http://immigrationimpact.com/2018/04/16/undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes/

Gavin Rey the Netherlands have never had an issue with Belgium having half of the economic structure nor has Belgium had cartels running the country killing and beheading teachers in the middle of the street for their beliefs. 333000 people from Belgium or not rushing to change citizenship to the Netherlands anyway and refusing to work don't pay taxes, these comparisons idiotic.
Gee we've made it just fine since Rev. War without your medieval wall!
Geez
Gene Kutina   Wow   Nailed it.
Gene Kutina got that Pelosi?
Gene Kutina he is wonderful and the crap you speak of is nothing that is high on our priorities.   Get a real life.  We love this President.   He is everything g we need and God's gift to USA.  We want and need a wall.  Would suggest you pack your bags and leave USA because he is there 2020 and beyond.  Just look at his rallies   No one else comes close...when you leave take your wimpy men with you...
Gene Kutina huh?
Gene Kutina that is exactly what we see in the Democratic Party today!  STUPIDITY!
Gene Kutina try getting off of the "I hate Trump" bandwagon long enough to see that we do have a  big problem at the border that he is trying to fix. His solution is very wise, but there is too much opposition.
George Washington's State of the Union Address was a letter FOR THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA....and it was the FOUNDATION of The State of the Union Address...until Democrat President Woodrow Wilson made it a PR STUNT for politicians to gather and pat each other on the back!  Is Nancy Pelosi's "dissing" really a GIFT IN DISGUISE?  President Donald Trump has three choices.  1. He can start a twitter campaign calling out Nancy Pelosi for this, and we get another expensive boring "Dog and Pony show" none of us look forward to.  2. He could take the "Dog and Pony Show" out of Washington, D.C. and go back to what President George Washington did. Actually report to the legal and law abiding American's, call out the division, call out for term limits, call out for real reform in immigration via a demanding for the Visa Programs, Refugee status, having a wall/fence/barrier put in place and sharing that before he was elected, Democrats were willing to invest over 30 BILLION for a wall/fence/barrier for the protection, much like on their own private properties to protect themselves and their family, the legal and law abiding "American Family."  3. He goes ahead with the State of the Union...BUT, he walks in to the room this is held empty, for a "one on one" talk with the legal and law abiding American citizens that last 5-10 minutes at the most.  He walks in and doesn't even go to the podium. He sits down in a chair where the Democrats are not present, and tells the cameraman to pan around that room, showing the emptiness. He then addresses us.  He address the fact can be shown we need TERM LIMITS (What more American's want even more than a wall/fence/barrier) on Congress to get back to those actually doing their job, nothing more and nothing less, and it has become crystal clear, through mostly Lobbyism/Lobbists Congress cannot do their real job any more. Then talk about Senator Ted Cruz's attempt to pass a Bill to Law for TERM LIMITS on both The House and The Senate to get back to their assigned, through the Constitution of the United States, jobs!  He reminds us it is WE THE PEOPLE are their bosses. We foot the bills/pay the bills that they make, and way too many bills are being given to us that they have no right, per their Constitutional Oath, and we have to let our voices be heard.  (Traveling to DC has proven to not be a motivator for Congress...but we hold the real purse-strings, and the BIGGEST MOVE we could make is show we don't need the IRS, the real LIFEBLOOD of theft for politicians on us. Just look at the Socialist and Communist leaders in many states stealing tax dollars by finding ways to tax everything. EVEN WATER!!!!) DOWNSIZE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (This shut down is showing we don't need HALF of what we are paying for Federally!) PASS TERM LIMITS ON CONGRESS AND JUDGES! GET RID OF TENURE! FORCE OUR TRUE REPRESENTATIVES IN CONGRESS TO LIVE IN THEIR HOME STATE NOT WASHINGTON! BUILD THE WALL/FENCE/BARRIER! ENFORCE VISA'S, REFUGEE AND OTHER TIME LIMITED NON-CITIZENSHIP AGREEMENTS! BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY TO DAY OF CONVICTION EXECUTIONS FOR CONVICTED MURDERERS, RAPISTS, MOLESTERS, PEDOPHILES, KIDNAPPERS, TERRORISTS, THOSE THAT AID THESE AND THOSE THAT FALSELY ACCUSE THESE WHETHER THEY ARE LEGAL CITIZENS OR ILLEGAL ALIENS!

Get it done Trump, take no prisoner, just ground "em !!!!
Get it done now. If you intend to run in 2 years, your success will depend on this ONE issue. Your future platform could not include any more promises of a wall. You used up that one in 2016.-mb
Get it done then Mr. President.
Get it done!!!! Thank you for doing what is good for America
Get it done. Screw what they think. Is was important to all of them. Till you came into office. They will oppose everything you do.
Get off your high horse and reopen the government while you "negotiate". Stop using people as pawns to get your way. Not everybody can afford like you to not get paid for a month.
Get out!
Get outta here.  Our borders are doing very well as you well know.  Stop holding America hostage so you can claim a campaign win.  You don't care about border security.  You care only about yourself and your worshippers üò§

Give him a diapper that has the name Pelosi or Schumer on. But seriously Rod need urgent medication, he is suffering from TDS infection. A disease that when you change your thinking to Democrats, it can affect you within few minutesüòÇ
Give one actual reason. Not your opinion but a undeniable fact that is ground for impeachment
Give the State of the Union Address, the People need to hear  it...The DemocRATS are the ones holding up the Country...Build the WALL!  Pelosi is afraid to go to the building she should be in doing her Job for the American Citizens, because she is afraid it isn't secure, yet wants us to have Open Borders...what a moron !  Give it and Build the WALL PROTECT america and HER Citizens FIRST, put her and others on the other side of the wall with the people they seem to think they work for!

Give the State of the Union from the senate, and give it on time!  Pelosi is obviously scared stiff that you will tell all of our nation just how she and the dems/aka communists would take us all down.  Nice chess move.
Give the citizens of the US a tax deduction for contributing to the wall. You will allow us to make the wall decision, and go around Congress. It IS OUR country, and it is OUR money. Stop the madness.
Give them DACA, only IF they fund the wall, fix the loopholes and end Birthright Citizenship.

Glynda Lomax  THURSDAY, JANUARY 17, 2019  Overrun  I was praying for America yesterday morning and praying for the Senators and Congressman; praying that the Lord would shake everyone concerned awake and make them realize this government shut down has to end.  I was praying out loud and asking for an end times podcast for God‚Äôs People to prepare them for‚Ä¶and I was about to say ‚Äòthese end times‚Äô when I heard ‚ÄúWar.‚Äù And ‚ÄúOverrun!‚Äù And I saw a flash vision of people running in America‚Äôs streets and our coastlines being overrun with enemy troops. And no one was able to run far before they were killed. Our people are no match for these soldiers, that was clear to see. They were large soldiers. Whoever they were, they were wearing brownish green uniforms and they were big men. It was obvious to me we were well outnumbered, whoever they were. Lord! What is this You are showing me??  My Child, there is much My Sheep must go through before the end of these times in your world. America is on the brink of war, though she does not know this outright. (It is not generally known to the public)  Because her back is turned to Me, I will not protect her as her enemies overrun her and many, many lives will be lost. Many, many families will be unprotected as they do not know Me.  I heard ‚ÄúCollapse.‚Äù  The eyes of America are on its government and while it is distracted, the enemies of America are preparing. As a predator strikes the weakest of the herd, so will they also strike America while she is in a weakened state and bring down her government. They will go for the head and as America has uncovered herself for all to see her flaunt her indecencies and her abominations, she has no protection and her enemies will succeed. I am already calling them forth.  Prepare, for war is coming to your streets in America, My People. This is only the beginning. Much is coming for My People in other nations as well. Nations that think they do not need Me will soon see their need for Me. Nations who have turned from Me, who have rejected My Ways and My Holy Word will soon see which of us is God, for I will show them My Mighty Power.  Pray for the protection of all you hold dear. Pray for the lost among you. Pray I will hide you in the shadow of My Mighty Wings.

Go ahead President Donald Trump and always with.
Go back to history class.  The Berline wall divided a country that did not want to be divided.  Our American wall will divide two different countries that want to be divided.  See the difference or are you still blind with hate.
Go back to your history books, or youtube and listen to Eisenhowers speech regarding the military industrial complex. Listen to the speech that killed Kennedy. And dont forget to look into the National Bank supposedly killing Lincoln for trying to break up the central banking, now known as the Federal Reserve. Did you know the Fed reserve is a private company? Who owns it? Do you know?
Go build that way, that is why we voted for you. Thank you for all you can do in spite of all the hate. My President Donald J. Trump
Go for it Mr T; don't let the US be taken over like Britain has been!!(And I'm English!!)
Go get 'em, President Trump!  We're with you.
Go home Mexicans and towelheads.
Go on and build the fucking wall .You're our PRESIDENT !! Not the fucking democrates.
Go on get   quit bugging
Go play in traffic
Go president Trump! Thanks for standing your grounds..keep America great! Don't let this country go to hell in a hand bag. Don't let this country turn into a "shithole" like California.
Go to the freaking border for 1 day, and you will see the real threat. Just don't fly if you think it is a big threat. Wake up, you people have no idea how bad it is. But I am sure you will be the first to blame Trump when someone in your family is affected by this....
Go to work! Stop trying to be the king of social media! At least attempt to look as if you are working in that Big White House. Defend the people who are not working, or working and not getting paid. OPEN THE GOVERNMENT, you big cry baby.
Go trump
Go, Mr. President,  GO! stay FIRM and DETERMINED... what do you have to lose!? If it's going to be is because GOD  already said so... the dems have nothing to do with it...

God would never condone the actions of this individual. The fact that you can't see that makes you a fake.
God's blessings will be with the United States. The power of the United States with God 's temple is great.

Good job. Trump 2020.
Good lord, your hyperbole is absurd. Let me say this so even you can understand: WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. That includes your grandfather who was kicked  out of Germany for avoiding the draft, your mother who overstayed her visa, and your wife who faked her "exceptional talent" standing.
Good luck üôÇ

Good morning President Donald J Trump

Good thing they're not under attack
Good words. Very dramatic. Life isn't a movie though is it. Sit down ffs.
Good work I lol vote for hen again go Trump
Good!! The outdated concept of nations needs to be done away with. Nations lead to nationalism, and nationalism leads to hate, bigotry, and ignorance, and those things lead to people killing their fellow human beings.
Google say:idiot,haha
Gooooo President Trump!!!  We are with you sir.
Got that right we should have kept the TRUMP family OUT!
Got to go with Linda on this. ..read the description of heaven....a high wall. By the way, broad is the way that leads to death of destruction and a city without walls is doomed to capture.

HEY SS, THERE ARE 63,000,000 WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP, AND HE COULDN'T HAVE MADE IT IF HE DIDN'T HAVE THE BLACKS AND THE MEXICANS RIGHT IN THERE VOTING, TOO. HILLARY HAD PEOPLE WHO VOTED MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE HAD THE ILLEGALS VOTING FOR HER AND SHE STILL FELL SHORT. THE ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT HIM, HE SAYS WE DID THIS OR THAT,OBAMA ALWAYS SAID "I DID THIS" AND SAYS IT 20 TIMES IN A 5 MINUET SPEECH. WHEN
HOW MANY AMERICAN SONS WERE KILLED BY TIMOTHY McVEIGH? THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER? THE SHERMAN OAKS SHOOTER?? SANDY HOOK?? LITTLE CHILDREN?? BY WHITE AMERICAN MALES!!??? TRUMP DOESN‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT AMERICAN PEOPLE - HE ONLY CARES CARES ABOUT AMERICAN DOLLARS!!

Hang in there Mr. President. Mail them you State of the Union, you won't have to put up with the shout outs, and bad behavior from the Dems and then the press after. Instead have a rally....and show them the people who appreciate the work you are doing to protect our borders.

Happy birthday
Happy birthday! Now go build a wall make sure it‚Äôs around yourself though
Happy birthday, Patriot Logan!
Has anybody figured out why Americans Against Nancy Pelosi IS AFRAID of the #SOTU? She doesn‚Äôt want to face all the #AngelFamilies that President Donald J. Trump is sure to invite and sit up in the gallery. That will be thee most #EpicFail to date... I say open the press room ‚Äúsans‚Äù The #LameStreamMedia with all these families that have been affected in this 30+ year #crisis in attendance.... Let‚Äôs be honest here, the reason there are so many people wanting to come here, is all the jobs being created. Some of those jobs can‚Äôt be taken by Americans because they can‚Äôt pass #drugtests all because some of those illegals, and those temporarily employed by the Obama armed #cartels are bringing the drugs from down souf.... it‚Äôs the half circle that needs to end, or at the least deterred by any means necessary.... If we were to give job performance ‚Äúevals‚Äù to the dimocRATs at this time, they‚Äôd all receive #pinkslips.... They were hired for one job, and as of this moment, their work ethics are lacking, egregiously. It‚Äôs seriously time to move forward with the recall of both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer. They both lack fortitude. They must‚Äôve gotten into the ineptitude line by mitsake....
Have the SOTU in an stadium, garage or anywhere... BUILD THE WALL.
Have to secure and defend the border!
Having a strong, secure border without a wall is like trying to have a strong, superior military without weapons!
Having the National Parks trash picked up and our food inspected are more important than your temper tantrum.  Stop the Trump Shutdown and resign.
Hay ASS Hole when you Freaking Bloody use American working federal workers as a Ransom to get what you want your a Freaking dictator and a Freaking spoiled little brat because you can't get your Freaking Wall why freaking Keep people from getting paid not acting like a spoiled little boy that is throwing temper tantrum open up the Freaking Government and you still can negotiate on Boader security you No good want to be president what a Freaking Jackass
He could use executive order or his "humanitarian crisis" yet he seems to want to have the parties unifying and agreeing for it. The Democrat party members used to want that wall, Obama, Schumacher ,Pelo etc, did.  Why the change of mind? Why ?
He didn't have the votes. Republicans want the illegals for cheap labor and Democrats want them for votes and to set this country on a path to Marxist / socialism..
He don't like yo black ass dummy wake up .
He followed is promise to keep is country save , God bless Mr President God bless America.
He gave Nancy and chuck options. At this point they are the ones better keeping the government shutdown!
He had this photo photoshopped !!!!üòÇüòÇ Longer fingers and he is acting like he is skinny!! alternative president!!üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ùÑÔ∏èüí¶üá∫üá∏
He had two years to address this 'critical' issue and did nothing.
He has been cleaning up the mess Obama made for 8 years.
He has both republican majority in house and senate and didn‚Äôt do a damn thing lol
He is a trader ,liar and a moron
He is absolutely right.  I know for a FACT that TERRORIST are entering the USA via this way. Build the wall.....it will protect all the idiots too.
He is doing Great!
He is focused on the right stuff.
He is nothing but a fucking liar..
He is right!
He is standing firm for his Russian allies.    He doesn't care about our USA Coast Guard.   He doesn't care about any of us.    What part of that are you missing????
He is such a Liar .he is a TREASONOUS CRIMINAL Traitor
He is the enemy!!! Get him out!!!
He is the only president in YEARS to actually want to do the right thing for the AMERICAN public. If it saves just one life Isn't it worth it!
He is the president of the USA. If a wall is a national emergency than so is Flint.  Everybody is so democratic & so republican that no one looks at the big picture.   The U. S coast guard is working without pay!   Y‚Äôall assume that everyone that disagrees with you is a democrat. Trumpster logic.   If I wasn‚Äôt a democrat before best believe I‚Äôll be voting blue in 2020.  Regardless of your political leanings Trump is one of the worst things to happen to this country in a loooooong time.
He is trying to keep us safe and stop free loaders. It's amazing how he is keeping his promises and making America great again.
He is wonderful!!
He just wants to government shutdown so he can golf more
He likes it cuz they photo shopped him thin.
He looks like a basketball coach on the photo.
He loves these morons. They are anairpump to his ego,
He means empire. And undoubtedly the economy will crash so badly that this will lead to the fall of Rothchild.
He needs a new tailor.
He needs the budget
He needs to end your welfare, your kind is a special kind of stupid.
He needs to hit his head on every brick of the wall he wants to build
He needs to post it 57 more times.
He pis not the only Great person, or president to say that,check the history!!
He said "duty" lol
He said this while waving the Russian flag folks don;t let him fool you. All that asshole cares about is his own personal wealth.
He saved us by undoing all the bs Obama did
He seems to be the only one in D C who knows that
He sits on his fat arse tweeting all the time.
He sure is protecting his Government workers huh?  blah blah blah protection starts with helping out those who can't help themselves üôÑ
He the best
He wants free stuff, not freedom. Typical
He wants to be re-elected so don't worry and be happy with Trump.
He will be impeached.
He will continue to do nothing for you as well
He will get it done he's a business manüëäüëäüôåü§úü§õ
He will win & get his way with building the wall that's why he's our President our Leader !!!! If you don't like it you're welcome to go to Mexico!!!!
He won't Joseph his daughter in law was on Hannity last night & said so!!!
He'll defend the nation even if it destroys the country.
He'll get her done!
He's CAPTAIN AMERICA  to me !!!
He's The President of the United States of AMERICA voted in by the AMERICAN VOTERS wake up and he's kicking Asses!
He's a BEAST and he's eatn the dems alive! I love it! Winning, winning, winning!
He's actually right about this, so it's unfortunate that he is too incompetent and corrupt to carry out that duty.
He's been trying to open it everyday you goof but Pelosi and Shumer are playing games
He's doing that Jotaro pose
He's working hard at staying in line with the Constitutional requirement to protect our citizens. If those who were charged with the same effort work against the law, how can they not be charged for a violation of neglect of duty? Are we a nation of laws or not?
Head on over to petitions.whitehouse.gov and sign the petitions to remove Pelosi, Waters and Ocasio-Cortez while your at it. Stand firm Pres. Trump real patriots are with you!
Heads down!! Incoming liberal bullshit!!!!
Heather Hegge
Heather Hegge and I‚Äôm in no way a liberal.
Heather Hegge gee Heather, why is his administration wasting time on doing it then.  Sit down, your cognitive dissonance is showing.
Heather Hegge so you don‚Äôt understand my original question, retort to your reply, nor cognitive dissonance.  Cool story.
Heaven even has walls God put them there so if God created walls around heaven than why shouldn't we have walls also.
Heaven has a wall with a Golden Gate how will you enter ?
Heavenly Father may Your will be done. In Jesus Christ name The Son of God Amen
Hehehe the infiltration is seating on the throne and eating KFC McDonald's what bitter does he eat only what he ordered himself?
Helen Stein didn't hear of Clinton or Obama serving in the military either.
Hell has walls also, and that where fuckhead Trump is going, hopefully sooner than later.
Hell yeah
Hell yeah.üëç Support Donald Trump. It looks like Soros wants to  bring down American economy by inundating it with thousands of caravan people. It has evil Soros written all over it.
Hell yes
Hell yes!! Build the wall! Also stop muslims from entering our country and holding a office
Hello from Ireland. I love Trump!  Just kidding.  You're a tangerine turnip cockwomble spunktrumpet farknugget twatwaffle.
Help me understand something... The South seceded the US for States' Rights (1861-1865) and the US Army promptly invaded, and after the bloodiest (4) years in history, the US said "No to States' Rights" by force. Now, we have New York, California and others who are demanding States' Rights for a range of things like illegals, marijuana, sanctuary, etc... costing the country way more than the taxes and tariffs imposed on the South (even with inflation) and the US does nothing? Am I missing something? And don't make this about slavery...it wasn't. Both President Lincoln and Gen. Lee are quoted, many times, that it was never about slavery. That's a myth. My point is simple, why allow states to reject US laws and nothing is done? Why are their actions not considered treasonous and criminally obstructive? Why not march the US Marshals in and arrest all those state and local politicians for Obstruction?
Henry Durban  you have a great day too!
Here is a real president
Here is an idea if an illegal women has a baby give baby citizenship. Then send them home because a baby can‚Äôt be raised alone. Then at 18 then that child can come here legally to get an good education job. That give mom 18 years to become legal  and come with her child  common sense
Here is the latest oppression efforts lead by Facebook.. Now, when we like something you say, We are being sent to detention and not allowed to express our opinions, It happens every time, I make a  comment about standing up for America and the border wall.. Lets hope the Congress and the New AG will Look into how tech company's are suppressing free speech and thought by abusing there tools... Perhaps the FCC needs to be involved too... start asking some hard questions and laying serious fines down! Thankyou Sir ..Suggestion for the Suggestion box..!! Have a nice day....
Here is what is fraud:  https://www.briansussman.com/politics/how-obamacare-became-law/
Here's an idea - No Security Detail for any Congressional leadership- until they take the American people's safety and security and this nation's sovereignty as serious as they take their own personal safety.....  Has anyone asked how much taxpayers pay for  Pelosi and Schumers Safety and Security on a daily basis? How about this- we pay only 1$ for their protection and treat them the exact way they treat the American people, and Good Luck To Them.
Here's an idea. You have almost 200 military bases around the world. Close down 5 of them, and use that money for the wall.   You have almost 13,000 military aircraft. With much more being ordered to build. Don't build 5 of them, and use that money towards the wall.  You're worth $10 billion, so you say. Alot of which is assets for useless things like golf and country clubs. Sell 5 billion worth of it, and use the money for the damn wall. This should be enough. Plaster your name on it every 5 miles, and then shut up about it.  Once you do that, you can then finally focus on the real dangers facing Americans. Like say, drunk driving. Which literally kill hundreds of people a DAY. Immigrants, including illegals, have literally among the lowest crime rates of anybody. You got to look at that, and look for what's really wrong and then work to fix it. Scapegoating on illegals, for 'real Americans', which there's no such thing, is stupid. But what do you expect on Planet Stupid.
Here's another crook >:(  https://www.facebook.com/1537229243218831/photos/a.1627289967546091/2250342431907505/?type=3&theater
Here's the real 411 on the Shutdown. The Democrat led Congress is Flexing their Muscles over Trump. They Own the Purse Strings and Donald Trump is just like You who are wanting a paycheck. Trump has his hand out asking the Democrats Pelosi & Schumer for his money. SURE you are hearing some Democrat Trolls vilify & blame Trump, but In Reality Trump is only another citizen waiting for Congress to give out the money. He needs money to do the job just like you. SO IF YOU ARE HARBORING SOME DEEP HATE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR PAYCHECK THEN BLAME THE DEMOCRATS. They are playing Cat and Mouse and the President is now the mouse. REMEMBER the President is just One Branch of the Government. President -Congress-Senate, Supreme Court, they all have "Their Powers."  Just read the Ocasio-Cortez story- Jeez! She's still doesn't know what is going on yet.
Here's what I say to Trump: ‚ÄúMr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.‚Äù
Here's who we're dealing with: A tyrannical infant draft-dodging pussy chickenhawk who is so conflicted about everyone knowing he evaded the draft with rich daddy's help that he refuses to listen to the advice of any military advisors.   https://www-m.cnn.com/2019/01/16/politics/donald-trump-isis-syria-warning/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F

Hi
Hi Mr. President.
Hi girl üëß
Hi my friends!  It's a situation in Georgia, but you have repeatedly said, "We did not leave you and help you, and where is it? But they have wound up internal divisions, but what are we doing here ?!  The mafia has come into operation and my family is forced to sell the house, and here we are interested in the criminal authorities in Russia who are governing this government.  You leave me here and enjoy where it is and help them to get rid of the car that I can not even get back for a number of years and what is going to be a friend, so that's why Ivanishvili and Saakashvili can not dare to dare.  This is why the crisis, the obstacle, the problem and the back of the country and the country's business as well as the world's politics, because the amazi intrigues are cut down everywhere.  Yesterday the apartment building exploded, the children were killed, and I saw that this is a sabotage committed by the mafia and what we will see will be officially seen together with the mafia method of money laundering.  So please do this if you help us finish this mafia and rest you and we also took the country from the Russian mafia and the tries to keep them back to the source so you are cautious if you want to actually defeat the Russian mafia !!  With respect to meüá¨üá™
Hi what's up dady
Hirona ,Harris and Feinstein need to check themselves on their ANTI CATHOLIC tone It is disgraceful. They need to read up on the history of the Klan In America and how they persecuted Roman Catholics.
His duty I did like this guy tell this wall now I can't pay my mortgage and losing my home but that's ok he's got money rich get richer that's way it will always be
His oath with GOD & You try to all Americans legally.
History is ginna look down on this President. And the kind of people that encourage Trump will be the forgotten Rebels of this failed Confederacy on our modern America. You wanna act like a bunch of dickheads at the expense of our civilization, then move to a country that would openly accept such disingenuous behavior, like Iraq, or Panama, or any other failed dictatorship.
History will not be kind to Trump and rightfully so.
Hmmm. So Nancy won't let Trump give the SOTU speech in the House. Sen. Rand Paul says Trump should do it in the Senate. Both those venues suggest seats filled by "tickets" given to radical protestors (like at hearings) liable to be disruptive and removed. On the radio yesterday, Rush suggested Trump rent a gynormous stadium like he does for his rallys, let the American people fill it, and give his SOTU there. Imagine a captive audience of constituents who WANT to hear what he says, viral videos on the internet so Americans can see and hear what POTUS wants us to know, and what the MSM will cut with commercials or edit out.
Hold our ground!!!
Hold out MR.PRESIDENT TRUMP WE NEED OUR BORDER SECURE, THESE ASSHOLES HAVE BEEN SLOWLY DETERIORATING  OUR COUNTRY FAR TO LONG
Hold paychecks from Congress a Senate..............
Hold the State of The Union at a MAGA Rally, that would be awesome!
Hold the line . Leadership like a boss. I am so proud you are my President.
Hold the line Sir
Hold the line Sir!
Hold the line, Mr. President.   The caravan is coming -- it will be another powerful example of why we need to secure our borders!
Hold the state of the union address at the border.
Hold your ground! These traitors want another 20 million that we all end up paying for!!!
Homo?  First off, I'm straight.  Second off - love how republicans try to claim a moral high ground while also using an entire classification of people as a euphamism for "stupid". I'm positive Jesus would approve.

Hope he  does  some  thing  about  the  4.2  billion dollars the  illegals are  stealing  from  the  IRS  per accounting  by  claiming  to  have  made  more  than  they  have  and  then  claim  there are  10  kids  inthe  hose  ,so  they  get  back more  than  they  paid  in  taxes.
Hope she cancels your so called state of the union! We all know what state we‚Äôre in these days!
Hope you cease to exist in the White House when Muller‚Äôs report comes out.
Horace Pinker are you mad that I could read and you can't. All you got to do is sound it out. Have fun working IN HELL
Horacio Daniel Hernandez and the Vatican's gold is more precious than American's lives?
Horacio Daniel Hernandez freedom is worth more then gold to me sir
Horacio Daniel Hernandez to South Americans everything in the US is gold also! You can't just let people in without them following the process that's what Buck Strunk is trying to say! Immigrats are people that come to this country legally, Dems want to just let in anyone without being vetted because that's a sure vote for them!
Horse
Horseshit.
House Republicans introduced a bill last Wednesday that offers to pay federal employees who work during the government shutdown. As the government is in a partial shutdown, five Republican lawmakers, Ohio Rep. Bob Gibbs, North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, Indiana Rep. Susan Brooks, Colorado Rep. Scott Tipton and Virginia Rep. Morgan Griffith, introduced legislation that would require federal workers be paid during the partial shutdown. ‚ÄúWhile Democrats continue to play politics with border security, federal employees dedicated to their mission of keeping America safe and our border secure are still going to work knowing they will be missing their paychecks,‚Äù Gibbs said in a Wednesday statement. Gibbs blasted Democrats for the shutdown in the statement, saying they are the reason federal workers are not being paid: They should not be caught in the middle of political ploys by politicians who are not serious about securing our border.  If they are working to protect America and the lives of our citizens, they should be getting their paychecks on time.  We shouldn‚Äôt be forcing these men and women to shoulder the burden of Democrats‚Äô unwillingness to work with President Trump and Congressional Republicans to solve the humanitarian and security crisis on our Southern Border.  Mr. President, please approve this bill as Federal and necessary people are working without pay!  They need to pay their bills and put food on the table. You can't make them suffer during the shutdown!  If this bill is passed, these people can get paid and you can still have a Government shutdown to accomplish getting the wall built.
Houston police: Child fatally shoots 9-year-old cousin while playing with gun Houston police say a 9-year-old child was fatally shot by a 9-year-old cousin while playing with a gun the children found in a local apartment. INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT THE BORDERS HOW ABOUT WE PROTECT KIDS WITHIN YOUR BORDERS, OR MAYBE MORE THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS
How about $10 billion towards climate change
How about Dems have a little respect for our countries security and what made this country great and realize that what they are doing is far from helping THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!
How about a fence with African lions inside so if they climb over into starving lions.cheaper
How about cutting Congress pay? Aren't they government workers?
How about defending our troops you moron? Stand up for Ukraine. Be a man and leader for once.
How about do your job mr. President. You're the one that took the blame for the shutdown. Now you should be the one to start it back up. Or are you waiting for the Democrats to look good because they started it back up.
How about getting rid of the Federal Reserve and printing money through the treasury..all debt would be gone over night..you stupid Jackass...
How about getting the people working again. You don't care about anybody except yourself.  Your a spoiled millionaire.
How about keeping our federal employees employed? It would be different if the Democrats said they would not negotiate border security. That is not the case. Democrats are more than willing to negotiate but keeping Americans hostage is more important to the righties and Mitch is weak by not allowing votes in the Senate. The votes are there to open the government. This is so stupid. Trump shutdown is all on Mitch.
How about learning how simple majorities and legislation votes are done, before you spout off
How about paying those who are defending the borders!
How about paying your employees?  That‚Äôs important.
How about telling the truth? Where does that land on your priority list? Does it even make the list?
How about the highest and most important stop holding 800K family incomes hostage for your invisible enemy!! Trump you are a joke and a loser.
How about you fire pelosi the old fossil?that will make america great again.
How are things in Crazytown today Donald? BTW, aren‚Äôt you do for your annual physical? Borderline obese. Too many BigMacs? The Trump shutdown is damaging the people you claim you care about! Loser!
How are you so concerned about the defense and safety of our country when your butt buddy is putin everybody knows you blow eachother kisses at night before you go too sleep
How bout you start charging them money to come in this country and work for this country and pay us the money they owe the cartel lol
How can you call yourself a real American if you hate Donald Trump. He has nothing but America's best interests and has done nothing but make this country great again just like he said god bless you and your family Mr Trump you saved America from the most coward and corrupt  Clinton's and Obama's nothing American about either of the scum. But once again thank you Mr President Donald Trump
How did Mexico paying for your wall become not paying Americans to blackmail taxpayers for paying for your wall? #Trumpshutdown
How did we become a notion again ü§î
How do "they" not see this?
How do your hidden meetings with Putin promote the defense of our nation?
How does that fit with your surrender to Russia üá∑üá∫. Puppet.
How have we made it 200 years with out dick bag trump?
How ironic can it be that Nancy Pelosi wants to postpone the State of the Union for "security" reasons? The whole government shutdown is on her shoulders for not having those same concerns for our national security!!! Build the Wall.
How is it a fraud Rod?  Explain that to us.  Use words and explain it.
How is this hard to understand?
How many AMERICANS can tRumP force to file bankruptcy (as he has several times) by holding them Hostage- Seems he cares more about RUSSIANS then Americans by fulfilling Putin‚Äôs wishes & Dreams then the American‚Äôs he is suppose to serve!!   NEGOTIATE the Dems want Immigration Reform & Security also!!!
How many Suzie Snowflakes do we have in here ready to whine?????
How many illegals are here now?? Well if is more than 1,999 there is a problem.. Build it they will stop coming.
How many kinds of stupid are you moron?
How many thousand American government employee's are currently not working who's job it is to protect us ?  That is defending a nation sir and you won't let them with your shutdown...   Let me repeat that Donald Trumps Shutdown.   So with that if National Defense is your highest priority?  You fail.    Resign
How many.of you anti wall people have gates and or fences around your yard?
How much do you know about what you are talking about? The wall in Germany was built to keep people from leaving the country.Our wall is for the protection of Americans. There is no comparison. I will get the Dems will believe the that comparison because the government that tried to keep people under control is the very government Dems are building.
How much does Russia pay you to post?
How much is that defense budget? Need some more? Suurree
How much money are the cartels paying the swamp to keep the borders open ? #askingforafriend
How much of a nation will be left as the poor begin to starve because food stamp benefits will stop.
How old is this picture this isn't the man that's in office right now LOL
How rubles does Trump make?
How sad ! Maybe the US will be great again someday.....perhaps.
How so, President Trump won the election according to the rules of the US Constitution.  He is delivering on his campaign promises as few president have done before him in spite of a coordinated and constant attack on him by the establishment in the DC government, the News media and the Entertainment Industry.  20 years from now he will be remembered as an effective president after all of the current rancor is forgotten.
How?
Howard Parlen It's great we have our own opinion.
Howdy.  To recap: I‚Äôm a licensed structural and civil engineer with a MS in structural engineering from the top program in the nation and over a decade of experience on high-performance projects, and particularly of cleaning up design disasters where the factors weren‚Äôt properly accounted for, and I‚Äôm an adjunct professor of structural analysis and design at UH-Downtown. I have previously been deposed as an expert witness in matters regarding proper construction of walls and the various factors associated therein, and my testimony has passed Daubert.  Am I a wall expert? I am. I am literally a court-accepted expert on walls.  Structurally and civil engineering-wise, the border wall is not a feasible project. Trump did not hire engineers to design the thing. He solicited bids from contractors, not engineers. This means it‚Äôs not been designed by professionals. It‚Äôs a disaster of numerous types waiting to happen.  What disasters?  Off the top of my head... 1) It will mess with our ability to drain land in flash flooding. Anything impeding the ability of water to get where it needs to go (doesn‚Äôt matter if there are holes in the wall or whatever) is going to dramatically increase the risk of flooding. 2) Messes with all kind of stuff ecologically. For all other projects, we have to do an Environmental Site Assessment, which is arduous. They‚Äôre either planning to circumvent all this, or they haven‚Äôt accounted for it yet, because that‚Äôs part of the design process, and this thing hasn‚Äôt been designed. 3) The prototypes they came up with are nearly impossible to build or don‚Äôt actually do the job. This article explains more:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.engineering.com/amp/17599.html  And so on.  The estimates provided for the cost are arrived at unreasonably. You can look for yourself at the two-year-old estimate that you see everyone citing.  http://fronterasdesk.org/sites/default/files/field/docs/2016/07/Bernstein-%20The%20Trump%20Wall.pdf  It does not account for rework, complexities beyond the prototype design, factors to prevent flood and environmental hazard creation, engineering redesign... It‚Äôs going to be higher than $50bn. The contractors will hit the government with near CONSTANT change orders. ‚ÄúCost overrun‚Äù will be the name of the game. It will not be completed in Trump‚Äôs lifetime.  I‚Äôm a structural forensicist, which means I‚Äôm called in when things go wrong. This is a project that WILL go wrong. When projects go wrong, the original estimates are just *obliterated*. And when that happens, good luck getting it fixed, because there aren‚Äôt that many forensicists out there to right the ship, particularly not that are willing to work on a border wall project‚Äî a large quotient of us are immigrants, and besides, we can‚Äôt afford to bid on jobs that are this political. We‚Äôre small firms, and we‚Äôre already busy, and we don‚Äôt gamble our reputations on political footballs. So you‚Äôd end up with a revolving door of contractors making a giant, uncoordinated muddle of things, and it‚Äôd generally be a mess. Good money after bad. The GAO agrees with me.  And it won‚Äôt be effective. I could, right now, purchase a 32 foot extension ladder and weld a cheap custom saddle for the top of the proposed wall so that I can get over it. I don‚Äôt know who they talked to about the wall design and its efficacy, but it sure as heck wasn‚Äôt anybody with any engineering imagination.  Another thing: we are not far from the day where inexpensive drones will be able to pick up and carry someone. This will happen in the next ten years, and it‚Äôs folly to think that the coyotes who ferry people over the border won‚Äôt purchase or create them. They‚Äôre low enough, quiet enough, and small enough to quickly zip people over any wall we could build undetected with our current monitoring setup.  Let‚Äôs have border security, by all means, but let‚Äôs be smart about it. This is not smart. It‚Äôs not effective. It‚Äôs NOT cheap. The returns will be diminishing as technology advances, too. This is a ridiculous idea that will never be successfully executed and, as such, would be a monumental waste of money. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  This is set to public. Have a blast sharing it.
Howgh.
Huaa All the last 9 President's were in it 4 the $
Human trafficking is still going to happen .... why yall discriminating against hispanic/latino people .... at the end of the day we need to build a wall to keep out pedophiles, rapists,school shooters, corrupted cops ... the real threat to our people this is all bogus trump hates Latinos because vanessa has the hots for them she dated a latin king that's the real truth lol no one rapes more, does more drugs, sells more drugs,shoots up more innocent people then the people that are here in the country fix the problem here instead of making it worst for us
Hypocrite
I  am Trump2020
I  thought  that  was  the  role  of  the  C.I.C.? Mike  Pence is  President  of  the  senate  ........
I AGREE.
I AM AMAZED AT PRESIDENT TRUMP. I DON'T SEE HOW HE KEEPS UP WITH ALL OF THIS. HE HAS TO HAVE THINGS HITTING HIM AT 90 MPH FROM THE DEMONIC, DEMENTED DEMS CONSTANTLY AND HE SEEMS TO MANAGE SO WELL!! HE IS TRULY, TRULY AN AMAZING MAN!! HE SURELY HAS MY VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTION. HOWEVER, THE MAN IS A BILLIONAIRE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT BEHEST HIM TO TAKE ON THE HUGE PROBLEM OF BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES....ESPECIALLY FOR NO PAY!! IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD BE SPENDING MY TIME ON THE BEACHES OF THE WORLD AND FORGET ABOUT FIGHTING THE DEMENTED DEMS. HE DOESN'T NEED THE MONEY AND HE DOESN'T NEED THE AGGRAVATION AND PROBLEMS BEING PRESIDENT BRINGS. I LOVE THIS MAN FOR GIVING HIS ALL TO AMERICA!!!
I DO BELIEVE YOU ARE A FRAUD...TROLL   But I see you are a New Yorker,,,so I guess that's why you're so deranged...poor guy.

I LOVE YOU
I Like How You Are Rulling Your Country, Trump
I SAY THOSE WHO DON'T MUCH CARE FOR THE WALL GO AHEAD AND LEAVE YOUR DOORS AND WINDOWS UNLOCKED...
I TOTALLY AGREE. AND THEIR STAFF TOO.
I WILL BE VOTING FOR TRUMP IN 2020! BEST PRESIDENT!
I admire many black people I do not admire the ones just like the white dinner anti-america
I adore reading all the pro-Trump posts and noting all poor the grammar and spelling. Don‚Äôt forget, all you pitiful fans of the dope, that Trump openly said he LOVES the uneducated. LMFAO  And there you go, he LOVES you. Hope that thought pays your bills! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
I agree
I agree 100
I agree Build The WALL send gun choppers down to patrol our Border and warning shots to stay away from our Borders. Call up their President and Mexican President and start charging fines. Change the Tampered Language Obama , Clinton‚Äôs, Pelosi, Schumer changed to make it open Border to allow Mexican, Middle-Easterners and Central Americans Ect. All to enter the U.S.A. Stop allowing so many in , or to come here at all Crime is rampant ! Rape then murder, it‚Äôs appalling! We are only one Country get them out of our Government they are tearing our Country to pieces. Be more like Poland . No  strangers are allowed to mass invade and come in on their families and citizens to do them harm by diseases, rape, murder, illegally/ or other wise unvetted. Traitors speaking against us the American people we will not give up our guns to protect ourselves with, we will not submit to or obey an ideology that goes against our Christian Beliefs they should be deported out our Country . No to Sharia Law it is incompatible with the Constitution of the U.S.A. Mc Carran-Walters Act 1952. Thomas Jefferson V. Muslim Pirates.1800s.
I agree Sherri
I agree it should be
I agree l be praying
I agree we need to defend our borders and at first I was all for the wall but now that it‚Äôs hurting so many people I think discussing an alternative like placing our troops along it enforcing a no enter at all zone or you can fine Mexico. Mexico should be the ones stopping their people from coming or be fined. Americans that work and Veterans should not have to go without a pay check. The economy is going to suffer as well as people voting for you next election. Sit down and discuss another alternative to the wall and get these people back their pay please.
I agree we need to have secure borders but get the government open so people get paid. Granted people should plan with emergency money put aside but the reality is people spend what they make.
I agree with President Trump 100%
I agree with border security- but get rid of all the specialty visa‚Äùs and stop allowing wealthy people from around the world to come here for 3 months and have their anchor babies as well - it is a very multifaceted problem - chip away at the loopholes.
I agree with u dear president, best wishes‚Äî-a Chinese guy who is eating watermelon.
I agree with you Mr. PRESIDENT!  But how do we convince the unreasonable Democrats? CNN is a bunch of Lying Scumbags!
I agree with you Mr. President.  Wholeheartedly.  But please don‚Äôt attempt to divide God‚Äôs Land, Israel, in any way.  West Bank, Jerusalem, or any portion. It belongs to God Himself.  Peace plan or no peace plan, help to keep Israel intact.  You‚Äôre doing a great job Sir, but please STAND with an INTACT ISRAEL.  God bless you, your family, the USA, and His land Israel.  JERusaLEM jerUSAlem üá∫üá∏‚ô•Ô∏èüáÆüá±
I agree with you, Mr. President!
I agree!   If WE don't  defend our Nation, then WHY bother with  anything else!  üò†  It will not matter anymore!     They all say SAFETY FIRST>>>>>>>üôèüëä
I agree!  MAGA 2020!
I agree!!!
I agree, President Trump is trying to do this inspite of the DEMOCRAT'S.
I agree, but it is also being destroyed from within.
I agree. A country without borders is just open land. Build that big, beautiful door Mr. Trump & let's maintain ownership of this great nation. I support you
I always felt that protecting our borders was No.1 on the list of government jobs. It about time! Get it done!
I always knew you people literally worship Trump as a god
I am a TRILLION PERCENT BEHIND YOU!  That is Your primary duty, and You do it Excellent!  Don‚Äôt budge even a little; or they will know You can be intimidated, just like all the Presidents before You!  Tell Linsey, ‚ÄúTHANKS, BUT NO THANKS‚Äù!
I am an African and I supported of Donald J. Trump from Day one , I was called a fool, I asked why and I was told " Donald J. Trump Policies are nationalist and not globalist" and I asked won't our country be better if we have Trump like as a president, when has taking care of family first before pleasing the public becomes an evil?
I am for the wall, but the longer it takes to make a decision and to act on it knowing the left will never approve. It will also take time to physically build it why aren't we considering that. Time is of the essence .
I am getting concerned about some of the government programs that are necessary for life in our country. Like WIC and food stamps, especially for single mothers. Please don't let them have problems. You can solve this problem with Congress ... just think ,, what would Jesus do in this situation?
I am maybe from Czech Republic but i am grateful for you Mr. President Trump. Yuo are fighting for the entire Christian world. Dont stop, keep in your way.
I am ok without a border but do something to make them pay taxes just like me. I wish I could get paid in cash, tax free for working my ass off.
I am so proud
I am so proud of you!
I am so tired of people bitching about the shut down. If its a problem for you all, call you congress, Senate and tell them to get off that high horse and protect America. Maybe if enough people complain they will do what is right for America and quit acting like a bunch of idiots. Mr. President do what you have to do. Protect America.
I am standing up with you you are doing the right thing for our country
I am very proud of my President... Waterbury Republicans for Trump. Right-through!
I am with all Trump voters who will vote for him in 220.:-)
I am with you let's make American great again
I am with you on this!  Stay strong and force Congress to do the jib they promised Reagan if he would grant amnesty to 11 million illegals! They promised absorbing 2006 but failed!  STOP PAYING CONGRESS UNTIL THEY GET THE JOB DONE!
I am with you.
I am!! Trump 2020!
I appreciate your defending us.   We‚Äôre up against people who actually want us to cease to be a nation.  They refer to us as ‚Äúnationalists‚Äù, using the term (which I consider to be patriotic) disparagingly.   They loved Barack Hussein Obama ‚Äî he was a citizen of the world who bowed before Arab princes.  These people are our enemies.
I ask the President of the United States of America to intervene immediately in Iraq and kill the clergy and kill the Communist Party and the coup to the military or royal and liberate the people from their control and open a bar and night club everywhere and I hope to have a relationship with Israel and open them an embassy in Baghdad
I believe I‚Äôve paid enough federal taxes in the last couple years to pay for the wall. Go ahead with it.
I believe in the power of ‚Äòno‚Äô üòú
I believe only you and God can save our nation.
I believe our President need's to stop paying congress and put the real worker's back to work. Our congress is a joke! Please dock their pay for not doing their job. Put our American worker's first.Drain the swamp and replace all congress officials with term limits.
I believe you took an oath to uphold the constitution...have you read it yet?
I believed The President Trump.
I bet every Angel Mom would go without a paycheck in exchange for having their child back!
I bet your farts smell like cheese and artichoke heart üò£
I c u not paying the other wall the coast guard
I came here for the comments. (Was not disappointed) I find it halarious that everyone needs a voice on social media instead of a hobby in real life... maybe everyone should go outside for a bit...  The government has been shut down for how long? And the sun still goes up and down every day. Something to think on there
I can not believe Beto said he would abolish the Constitution today! He said no one follows it anyway! If that is NOT a verbal acknowledgement that the Democrats are trying to eleminate our laws.. Which is TYRANNY!  That verbal statement shows that we are fighting a domestic enemy! These people slipped through our system that failed to prosicute these people for their self confession of taking out the constitution! Why arent you people holding those accountable for stating this is their agenda..  And they sit in as a member of congress who are allowed to make laws and change them.. And no one is doing anything about it? Why? We demand answers!
I can tell you the most important thing he did for me he lowered my corporate tax rate from 37% down to 21 he got rid of that useless Obama Care mandate he made it possible for employees to buy health insurance through other companies in across state lines and that's just a couple that I can think of that changed my life my business has never been so busy since I have been in business everybody I know is hiring looking for people every corner you turn there's a help wanted sign unemployment is at its lowest rate in decades Beverly you should head down to your local government and apply for support pet you can get a chicken and put it on a leash and you can take it everywhere you go to the doctor to the supermarket to the gas station and when you're feeling down and out you can grab that chicken and give it a nice hug and it might help you with all that anxiety you're having
I can't even imagine what our nation would have been like under Clinton!  So grateful for President Trump!
I can't wait until you cease to be President.....
I cannot wait until your term is over or you get impeached. You're sick.
I cant believe that many cant understand this
I cant wait till this trump movie is over and he is not our president any longer ..
I can‚Äôt believe Carl Ostenderp is still peddling his leftist lunatic tripe.  LOL.  SO funny.
I certainly want to hear the State of the Union Address, so don‚Äôt let Pelosi intimidate you, and deny this to the Patriots of the USA.
I completely feel like you have NO IDEA on what you're doing anymore.
I concur. When will TERM LIMITS be on the ballot????? We insist upon it.
I didn't get paid but don't let that stop you president Trump keep fighting for the wall I'm behind you if I lose it all. I can always ask for the freebies if American citizens are eligible.
I disagree with both of you. I believe the Democrats did shut down the government. I don't believe they did it over 5 billion dollars. I believe they did it out of defense for our American values and ideals. America is beginning to look a little to much like a prison. Guns in churches and schools, metal detectors in hospitals, court houses, and government buildings, and now a wall and security wire around the border? What's the difference between our nation and a maximum security penitentiary? We are becoming a little to harden. President Roosevelt feared declaring war for this very reason. He reasoned that the people would become to hardened and that the mentality would replace mercy and forgiveness. Fundamental emotions of all human beings. Defending our country's most sensitive beliefs is worth every loss we will incur during a lengthy government shutdown (showdown). Our virtues are worth defending. It is more important now, in the state our country is in, than it ever has been in America's brief history! Do you really want our values to go extinct? It's about more than border security. It's about more than 5 billion dollars. It's about who gets to determine the nation's system of beliefs. Do we believe in welcoming our neighbors, protecting the weak, sacrificing for the poor, or do we believe in a nation of walls, hardened schools, guns in temples, a nation that is so afraid of its own citizens that it needs metal detectors at the courthouse and even worse at the hospital! I'm for border security but I have to stand against a wall and what it stands for. There is just so much more at stake than a mere barrier between our nations.
I disagree with the President canceling the military flight for Pelosi ..I would have waited ..Then canceled the return flight. üòÇüòÇüòõüòõüëçüëç
I do not see anything wrong by securing our borders.  Entering LEGALLY was and is always an option.  God bless you MR. President.  Hold your grounds in Making America Great Again.  Looking at Europe's current crime crisis from illegal immigration only praying that wall will be built and built soon.
I do support the border wall.üôÇ
I don't care about a wall or not.... I care about the people that are working without a paycheck and as president trying to get your way over those peoples back is just wrong.
I don't know Him Much Let Him do the right thing.
I don't mind adding the DREAMERS to the WALL NEGOTIATION but I want the PRESIDENT to up the WALL price to $50 billion so it can be DONE RIGHT the first time, so we DON'T KEEP GIVING AMENISTY every FEW YEARS for ILLEGAL ACTS with the SAME ISSUES and maybe he should be ADING IMMAGRATION REFORM with the DEAL also to further stop the LOOPHOLES.
I don't see any problem of having a border wall at all, it is important, it is essential and it is necessary to have it. Those illegal immigrants digging a hole under or climbing over  are criminals. If my country has problems other than war do I illegally run away  to the neighboring country ? No.
I don't trust William Barr.
I don't understand what the Democratic Party is about anymore, Protect our Nation!!!
I don't understand why the Democrats are more concerned about illegals than the people who pay their salaries!!!
I don't understand why we didn't vote to secure our borders when the Repubs had the majority !!
I don't want Trump impeached. I want him to resign in disgrace or have his flabby ass kicked out in 2020. Either way, we're gonna see another Blue Wave in 2020. :) He's such a slimy loser.

I dont know if u r the real Donald J. Trump but good job! I wish I had even the slightest business smarts you have to grow my company!
I dont see why we need to have the wall us Americans are making the drugs now ! He's demanding way to much money for the wall and taking money from workings family's and their food stamps how is that good for our country he's attacking us
I don‚Äôt care about getting paid and providing for my family and my two year old daughter who needs food. But I know if my president wants to protect our nation then it‚Äôs ok.. it‚Äôs ok if I starve and my family. It‚Äôs all for GREAT cause right? Trump is always looking out for me
I don‚Äôt care what the rest of the world thinks of our president. They probably did love Obama because he wasn‚Äôt  for America.
I don‚Äôt get it.....  CANCEL. ALL.  FREE. Handouts. To. The. I‚Äôllegals.......  we could build 10 walls.......
I don‚Äôt know why US President Donald Trump does not allow his followers and supporters to protest against these perpetrators of violence to prevent such disruptions. Mr. Trump's opponents have set a new record in shamelessness and impudence and they have spread the violence widely. It is really unbearable! üá∫üá≤Ô∏èüá∫üá≤Ô∏èüá∫üá≤Ô∏è
I feel like this picture of him was photoshopped, something seems off
I feel so sad that you Mr. President have to take so much from the CORRUPT and EVIL Dems, but I THANK YOU for Putting Our Country FIRST !!!!
I feel sorry for trumpsters they are like a battered women They never want to believe the truth . Every bruise and black covered up. They continue to lie to cover his crimes. As  the  walls close in on individual one which slide of history will you be you be on ? Im guessing there will be alot of you feeling like fools when it all goes down. Trump=treason
I feel you about the wall if they dont want to help you when they seek your help veto everything and show them how it feels but please this government shut is hurting millions and no one seems to care. So when they call upon you for something give them a whole cup of veto juice Obama did in till he got what he wanted .
I found this post from a California resident giving his version of what's happening in CA.. "It doesn't matter what color we vote, The Dems have rigged the elections in California.. An illegal gets a driver's license and is automatically registered to vote.. He then gives his absentee ballot to a ballot Harvester Who votes blue and turns in the ballot..Voter ID is not required in California.."
I fully agree! Please don't give in Mr. President. üá∫üá≤üòé
I get that but taking food stamps peoples pay checks and so on your creating chaos people will steal for food and be living on the streets put troops at the border give men jobs wall is to expensive unreasonable
I give tRump this much; for a man at his age, at his height, with bone spurs, to be able to get on his knees and get his mouth lined up just right with someone as short as Putin.... that's GOTTA be physically difficult to do. But I saw it. Right there in Helsinki.  #PutinsCockHolster #StateOfTheSovietUnion #TreasonousTrump Winter is Here Mueller is Coming
I got my facts at: www.humantraffickingsearch.com which confirms this horrible epidemic ‚ù§Ô∏è
I guess from my perspective,  I see that immigrants illegal or not work their asses off and some are good at what they do, but. The some folks that have the privilege to be here in the US  think they dont have to work or as hard. MY OPINION!! No recourse needed.
I guess that is why you are a draft dodger! How are those Bone Spurs? ROFL!
I guess the wall will magically be built overnight
I guess those 240 year before you showed up don't count.
I guess we have not been a nation from day one.....hmmmmmm
I guess you didn't see the latest in the senate, as they tried to block a removal of sanctions against a Russian Oligarch. Or his comment, that Russia was justified in the invasion of Afghanistan, or his taking and hiding the translator notes from his talks with Putin, or....etc etc. Your description of mainstream media as garbage indicates you, yourself, have a raging case of Coprophagia. Wise up, Mr. Green. The hour is late.
I hate selfies  are people to lazy  to say what they mean  just put a picture
I have a MUCH easier solution.....get rid of all the illegals AND the liberals and we don‚Äôt need a wall!
I have a dream of being a President of the World who will be a Good Leader of all the Presidents of the Countries to all over the World @South Africa
I have a question, you are require to give congress a state of the union address but Representative Pelosi has stated that is her house and because of security reason you can give it. (It's Americans house but we won't go there for now). Why can't  you address the other chamber of congress? Send her the address on paper like she wanted but give the address from the Senate floor.  How can she stop that.  She doesn't control that.  If she wants to be left out it's on her. Heck let her go on her trip then
I have a question: If, as Trump claims, the border wall is a "national emergency", why is it that the Governors of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas have failed to declare their own emergencies, and called up the National Guard in their states? I have not seen or heard of any action taken by the states, so it seems absurd to me that the border issue constitutes an emergency.
I have an idea better than the wall that will not cost taxpayers one cent. But it is too easy so nobody listens. Mr Trump, just ask me.
I have an incredibly kind heart. I hope they all make it into America ...LEGALLY. You can't properly vet an illegal - you just can't. Fund the border wall and everyone gets paid. It's that simple. Every LEGAL American wins that way.
I have only voted once in my life, and I voted for Mr. Trump, we were needing a big change, the government is so crooked and we needed change, Not saying that Mr. Trump can get this place cleaned up but it is  a start.
I have the view of the US soap opera from outside. And can't believe how pathetic and ridiculous this country has become, tks to the 45th. U guys have no shame? The whole world is watching. üëÄ
I have your back Mr President !!
I heard the liberal Read it in small print with large glasses that they couldn't find!
I honestly don't think you even understand what it is that makes us a nation, which is why you will never be considered a great president. For everyone else, though, here's a reminder: http://constitutionus.com/
I hope our president never gives in.  He is trying to protect our country.  God bless you President Trump.  You have my vote again in 2020.
I hope that united states of america be peace
I hope trumps punishment for treason is public hanging on pay per view... Use the money to build him a wall
I hope you are taking down walls in your home, leaving your doors unlocked and taking illegals in. Come on, where‚Äôs your hearts??
I hope you see the walls of your prison cell soon.  Who will piss in your hair then??
I just hope the Wall isn't meant to keep US in.....LOL
I just read these pro trump comments and it really is just amazing, hook  line  and sinker
I just want President Trump to be wise and intelligent.
I kind of feel with those who aren't getting paid, like there being punished for the acts of people coming over to USA. It's all sad
I knew Nancy Pelosi would eventually pull her penis out to show Trump who has the bigger one.  She is disgusting.
I know it  You know it  Everyone I know understands it  But ask yourself this , how do you get democrats to pay for it ? Offer to step down and they will give you $100 billion plus . They just don‚Äôt like you because your doing a great job witch includes smashing their agenda
I know why the Democrats are against President Trump.  The is keeping his campaign promises and it is making them look bad.üá∫üá∏
I know you didn't mean that statement literally. Ignore the ignorant word police.
I know you read these, Mr President so you should know we support you and WE WANT THE WALL.
I like Trump but he's screwing up like Nixon did......
I little bit mistake it was
I live by the border and this is the huge waste of money ego ploy.
I love Donald Trump
I love President Trump!i will vote for him again
I love You somuch Daddy Trumpüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπüåπ

I love my President!!
I love my President!!!
I love my President.
I love our President and First Lady
I love you
I love you trump  I am indian
I love you trump.
I mean Bigly Mac!
I mean.. in what metric do you mean failing?  Greatest job numbers ever, largest stock market numbers... ever, lowest unemployment, low gas prices, The Korea peninsula talking?  I mean.. What is the failure you're referring to?  You don't like the guy, that's fine, but the results are quite measurable.
I need 5 minutes of your time... Mr Trump... 5 minutes... MAGA
I need my food stampsüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I never said income taxes. I said taxes. Everything they buy here, they pay taxes on. Just like you or me.
I notice everyone who says a wall is useless, senseless or stupid has walls in their homes. Some even have giant walls or fences around their perimeters.
I pray over you Mr. President  It's a shame you have these crazy Democrats..all they are are kids who wasnt ever punished in their youth.. May God lead you with His hand and deliver you from evil,  and the Democrats who think they are all powerful.. I pray you smite them all and show them who the Real Boss is..In Jesus name.. To God be the Glory forever and ever.. Democrats...you are not In control of anything... but The all mighty God.. Blessed be the name of the Lord
I rather like President Trump. He is a straight talker. He does what he says he is going to do. In other words he gets the job done when other Presidents just talk about doing it because they are afraid of the outcome. What‚Äôs wrong with that. He is a little rough around the edges, but gets the message across. He has brought respect back to this US of A from foreign countries because they know he is not kidding around. I don‚Äôt care about his private life or who he did or did not have an affair with. I don‚Äôt care about any of this stuff just as long as he does the things he promised in his election campaign. If you think I‚Äôm wrong, just look at the total mess Europe is in and for that matter the rest of the world. We should be lucky to have a person like Mr. Trump who wanted to take on Washington and work for the people of this great nation.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
I rebuke you in the name of jesus liar!!!! This is not how things where supposed to be!!!
I refuse to vote for a pathological liar. Why would you?
I remember when Hillary  was involved with Russia!
I said this before with all the jobs auto and candy makers in Mexico that country should be a boom town for jobs   Oh I forgot Uncle Sam has FREE Aid while WE the tax payers have to fight tooth and nail for help
I salute you sir
I say just shoot them as they come over. Or you could build the wall like trump wants.
I say the same thing! BUILD IT!!!
I see the trolls are out in force to try to negate the amazing accomplishments of President Trump.  Trump 2020!!!!
I sgree
I stand 10.000%  Mr. DONALD TRUMP,  President of the United States of America !!!!
I stand with President Donald Trump.
I stand with President Trump BUILD the WALL
I stand with President Trump! üëçüëç
I stand with our president ...our number one priority is our nation's safety especially from the illegals invaders and muslims...
I still can‚Äôt get over this part: Michael Cohen paid the tech company for its campaign-related work with nearly $50,000 of CASH STUFFED IN A BAG.  Classic mob move.üôÑ
I support Trump 110% I agree on legal immigration but the ones coming across the border are draining our schools are cities or states God Bless America
I support the wall! But it is time for ALL of them to come to an agreement!! If not!!  STOP ALL OF THEIR PAYCHECKS!!
I support trump but this wall is the dumbest waste of money I‚Äôve ever heard of.... come on. It‚Äôs 2019.... the wall will do nothing except get ripped down in 20 years
I support you 100%.  However, if you have the power to declare national emergency to get this done and resolved and hundreds of thousands of American workers can get back to work, please do so and stop playing into Pelosi's hands.
I support you Donald Trump and pray for this country daily....Thank you...
I support you your excellency
I support you.  I want the ‚ÄúState of the Union Address‚Äù.  Give it to them!
I support you... in fucking yourself!
I suppose Old Man Trump knows Just how much Racial Hate He stirred up In the bloodpot of human hearts When he drawed That color line...  Woody Guthrie 1954
I sure am.  Thank you.
I thank the President for being the tool we the people use to push the corrupt and greedy into the spotlight.  We want a wall, politicians been promising it for years, THIS President is willing to stand firm, obdurate in the face of slander, lies, innuendo and threats from our corrupt institutions, media, hollywood and academia.  AGAIN,       THANK YOU Sir!
I think 20 people from Main Street could work out a immigration plan. PELOSI TIME TO DO YOUR JOB!!!
I think I will re post this every day just for youüòÇüòÇ
I think he's awesome
I think it's good for the wall because I can see that the people who do not have a respect because they say that it goes to the good and the bad, and I think that when a person wants help, please ask, not so rebellious, and I think that the democrat only wants to see the people who are below.
I think it's hilarious all you people are calling Paul delusional it's you liberals and democrats you people are delusional ones take a good look in the fucken mirror it would do yourselves a big favor to Just shut the fuckup
I think it's time Judy goes to a retirement home. She clearly has Alzheimer's.... js
I think its time to change the channel on Celebrity Apprentice. A government can not be run like his TV show. He should return to NY while he still has a business to run  with all the swamp he brought with him .
I think mr president should just penalize and fine everyone who doesnt want the wall‚Ä¶ u know just  like Obama did to everyone who didnt want that worthless obamacare
I think that is what the left wants
I think that this isn't best shot with that corner piece of the flag üòÅ
I think that's why the bill that the house passed, the senate did a voice vote with 100% support, and YOU agreed to sign included $1.6 billion for border security isn't it?
I think the Shutdown and the border wall are a *hypocritical* and *vicious distraction* from Trump!!!  Remember, Trump opens all borders for Putin (Syria, NATO, Afghanistan ...)   The border with Mexico is distraction !!!  I don't know from what?   But the Wall Money could help Trump with whom or whatever? !!!   Trump is a Madman
I think the military should be deployable to defend our borders.  Those laws should also be changed.
I think we should all sell our souls to bend over for Nancy Pelosi!
I think when we have a shutdown we should take the Congress and the Senate pay check off also and see how fast they come together
I think you can build your wall ... just in your dreams
I think you need to take a closer look at what you‚Äôre important duties are for this country. First of all it is to unite the people of this country! Something you failed to do since day one. Second of all it is to work across the aisle to ensure the safety of this country and by shutting down the government is certainly no way of doing that.  you have endangered our country even more by your actions. Second of all as a veteran I have serious concerns about our troops. When I was in the military we did not discuss the president. I served under Ronald Reagan. We did not discuss the president we did not discuss politics we did not discuss political parties. We had a job to do and that was defend this country. We did not need division between troops. We had to be there to protect each other the only person that had my back it was the man standing next to me. I had to be able to trust him with my life and he trusted me with his. We never discussed political parties we never wanted any kind of division in our battalions. So politics it was never discussed.  I‚Äôm afraid things have changed in the military today. And I see our troops been divided. That is the biggest danger to our country right now our biggest threat! Our president needs to unite our country and our people and our troops and stop dividing everybody! It is not us versus them it is America as one! Do your fucking job Mr. President you like the people of this country and make this country truly great again! Get off your ass and stop being an egotistical fucking freak only concerned about himself and care about the people of this country for once
I think you should being asking Paul Ryan & the rest of the never Trumpers in the Rep. party that question    President doesn't write laws
I think you would need alchemy or something for that not a wall
I think you're thinking of the last person to occupy the Oval Office.  He's the one who went around bowing and apologizing to everyone.
I thought it was my little pushy disturbing me here in Uganda. Mr president bravo #donald j trump. I wish you became our President too
I thought that to be a "great nation"  We have to take care of our veterans? I guess i wrong.......
I thought you defeated isis and we have more terrorist threats?
I totally agree with wall; we MUST protect our borders.  How about Congress and President going without pay until there's a resolution.  I bet that would hurry things along.
I urge moving the "State of the Union" Address to Independence Hall Philadephia, we need the Rock Solid visual of a Republic, at its Founding, and the back drop Story of those Events, this is a fight over the role of each branch of Government, no place surrounds those Ideals like the Home of the Founding Documents, our birth as a Nation, and the hope for We The People every where in the Wider World. Folks each American knows the story of Independenc Hall, and the Founding Fathers, with President Trump's skills in weaving in History, Events, and the Crowd, he can Hit a Home Run Speech likes of which has never been seen, the one liners will reverberate for years...
I used to joke that the best evidence the President is not an asset of the Russians is that his policies have been so pro-Russian that even the Russians would tell him, "slow down, you're being too obvious.‚Äù  But the damage done to our security is no joke, and demands an answer.
I voted for DJT because unlike the ‚Äòothers‚Äô he RETAINS !!!!! his OATH of OFFICE !!!!!
I voted for Trump and he has fixed a lot of lingering problems and done a lot of good BUT...it is so easy for us who are not Federal employees to say "Build The Wall" while some are losing their homes and going to food banks because they cannot even buy food right now. There has to be a better way of doing this than causing such good hard working people with children to suffer greatly....:(
I voted for Trump and will again.  He is doing what we elected him to do.
I voted for Trump as a Puerto Rican resident of the State of Washington and had quite a few disagreeable moments with some of my  Liberal  friends and relatives but I held my chin high and said: "He will prove you all wrong!" And he has! I will vote for him again in 2020! üëçüá∫üá∏üáµüá∑
I voted for Trump because his policies are for women, especially unborn women.
I voted for him and will vote for him in 2020.
I voted for the guy, but I've worked construct for 25 years and every Hispanic I've talked to over two decades, all came over on a plane.   90% of the world's heroin originates in Afganistan,  a country we control with a very powerful military.  So if f16's, machine guns, an ocean or two cant stop the drugs, how the hell is a wall going to? ü§î
I voted for you Mr Trump and felt you have been awesome but right now hearing on the news people who work for the government like coast guard are not getting paid I don't understand how making the little n poor people suffer will get the Senate n Congress to back the wall they are not suffering they still collect their pay the don't care about the less fortunate step on Congress toes take care of the lil peeps üíñ
I voted for you in 2016 and will vote for you in 2020. Keep up the good work !!  We are behind you.
I voted for you, and you are doing exactly what needs to be done. PLEASE KEEP IT UP!
I want a poster like this one.
I want chicken nuggets on a sliver platter
I want to see professors of Texas A&M in jail.  That bullshit i was attacked with an electronic arm it could do you hear into your mind voices o noisy it happend me in the university of texas at austin  I was attacked with an electronic arm from i was doing a postdoc in physics department at texas university at austin. They followed to mexico, the night before came back i was attacked and tortured into my mind during all night. I remind i went for a dinner to a small restaurant after i went back to hotel i started to heard voices of women and men talking all the night it looked how if they were outside of the hotel room. I couldnt sleep but my mind was damaged now but i had courage to left austin so i took airplane and flied to mexico. I arrived to mexico at night so i accomodated at hotel because the first idea comes to my mind perhaps i am sick so i hope to go with a neurologist to check my brain tomorrow. But that night in the hotel in mexico was worst because in the night started to hear voices again but now they laughed of me and talking during all the night thay they were from police that night i couldnt sleep. The story is long now my mind is quiet and after ten years i understood they just say stupid things. How did it begin? It started in the lab where i was the phd students started a game very strange so in the building of the university everybody knew me and i just took a couple of weeks. When i saw the behaviour of phd students were anormal i talked with them: i said them: you all have a problem with me and they answered that they had not troubles with you jesus. So i forgot everything. But they went on with the same: i dont know how they knew about all i talked with my family by cellphone. The had information about my activities in the university that was dangerous said myself. So i had to talk with my postdoc chief and i said : i think the phd students are doing something very bad very bad because they know about my cellphones. He answered: i dont think so perhaps it is a bad understood. Twice times i said this to my chief he always gave me the same answer. If you want a proof there is a call phone i did to my Banorte bank for changing my credit card because i found the phd students talking about all i talked with my family in mexico. The story is longer but it is truth, phd students in the physics department did this to me one day heard two students fight about how they had to go back a lot money .. the professors guilty are alex lozanne morgan berg frank rijka alfred lee neliza brito ans student called bryant.
I want to talk in English on messenger or any others. It is very important for speaking as a conversation. If any one interested, please add me and we carry on regularly conversation. Thanks.
I was at the game. I swear that Bundy was short of the goal line on that last TD. They should have had instant replay back then. Bundy would not be the legend he is today if there had been instant replay to show he did not score the winning touchdown in the final seconds.
I was until he went anti gun.
I will also vote for him again in 2020.  The only person I have ever voted for just for the fact that he is not a political lobbyists pet.  He is doing his job.  Never gets credit for what he has done and accomplished, but gets criticized for every move he makes.  Proud to say he IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
I will vote for him again in 2020 also!
I will vote. Trump 2020 üíØ%
I wish - actually not so much 'my' - Chancellor Merkel would understand this.  Much love and support from Germany. If you do this and they'll see it works they will have no excuse here as well. This project is important far beyond the US. And that's why they fear it. So good luck my brothers and sisters in the US.
I wish Bush had addressed this right after 9-11. Our southern border is only part of what needs to be done. We also need to protect our northern border, our ports, our air terminals and cyberspace. All of these are access points which need federal protection.
I wish Facebook would do their job and protect us from YOU.
I wish I could take credit for this but I copied it from another poster The US Southern border is approximately 1935 miles in length, however a physical wall/fence is only feasible on approximately 1600 miles. Recently (2018) the GAO issued an estimate that was similar to a 2017 Brookings Institute study on construction of a US Southern border barrier estimate of $20 million per mile in easily accessible areas and where there were no land/property acquisition issues and would take over 7 years to complete. The construction costs per mile for difficult to access some areas is estimated to run $70+ million per mile.  Regarding private land disputes (land usage, access and eminent domain) along the border area the legal costs for the US government could easily exceed $10 million per disputed mile per incident and take decades to resolve. On top of the legal fees, there would be annual lease payouts to the private land owners estimated at $1-2 million per mile or one-time purchases of approximately $10-16 million per mile. Some Texas land owners have previously petitioned for and received special border barrier access portals because they own and operate agricultural/farm/ranch/oil/gas land on both sides of the border that cost approximately $3 million each to construct and cost approximately $300K annually to operate and approximately $100K annually to maintain. There is precedence regarding Eminent Domain on the Southern border stemming  from the Secure Fence Act of 2006 signed into law by GW Bush 43. Any Eminent Domain assertion is challengeable in court and historically those court challenges have ended projects or stopped projects from starting and or progressing for decades. Previous federal Eminent Domain attempts along the Texas border have led to more than a decade of court battles where the federal government has so far lost practically every case.  Estimates for total annual maintenance and repair costs on a mixed concrete and steel barrier were estimated at $1 to $12 billion annually depending on age, needs and damage.  Bernstein Research estimated the easily accessible area construction costs at $17 million per mile and did not estimate costs for difficult to access areas and or legal disputes.  DHS estimated the construction costs at $13 million per mile and did not estimate costs for difficult to access areas and or legal disputes.  You can perform the math to project the total cost for each possible scenario.
I wish that was true Tony I can use the money!!!
I wish we had a president like that
I with you, Honey.
I wonder what unpaid TSA workers think when they hear "defense of our nation?"
I would LOVE to see Trump grow a beard. It would make him look more DISTINGUISHED and AUTHORITATIVE! Then the entire world would take him more serious. The Liberal Left radicals would go insane! ü§£
I would expect nothing less from my President. Thank you for your strength and commitment.
I would hold the SOTU address in the White House and invite key Senators and Congresspeople.  And ignore Pelosi and her minions as if they did not exist.
I would like to see a bill introduced that would take all pay checks from elected officials in the event of government shut downs. I mean ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS, from county to nationals. Also they forfeit them days of pay so you don't get it back. This would get them to the table quick. The people we elect hurt us so it's time we reverse the favor.
I would love to see a "fireside chat" on TV, with only the American people. No press, no Congress and definitely no papers sent to Pelosi ahead of time.
I'M WITH YOU ON THE WALL... MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN. PAY HOMELAND SECURITY NOW.!  THE USCG WORKING WITHOUT PAY IS A DISGRACE!
I'd ask you what he is saving the country from.. but then you would list a bunch of proven wrong talking points from FOX news or Rush Limbaugh. No point in arguing with a brick.
I'd live here, anyway. Wally West
I'd love to have a president who can spell :(
I'd rather us cease to be a nation than have you continue to "lead" it. Cuz youre gonna end us anyway.
I'll bet he would open the government back up if all air traffic controllers go on strike. Hint.
I'll leave Will Hurd right here...Republican Rep.in Texas...ask him his view...it's been well quoted.
I'll pay for your ticket so you can deport yourself to Cucklandia above us.
I'll take "Worn out Strawman for 200, Alex"
I'll take the border patrol's word over CNN.
I'll vote for Donald a 2nd & a 3rd time if I neef to.The Dems are trying to destroy this country.
I'll vote for Donald. Nobody else has any references! Check that out?
I'll vote for that man in 2020 also! BUILD THE WALL!  And anyone that doesn't like the wall or the idea of it should go live on the other side of it
I'm behind you100% Mr Trump sir
I'm glad Trump has accepted full responsibility for the shutdown of the government.
I'm guessing you don't live in the EU. Here everyone has open borders and every country is full of immigrants. It's fucking awful
I'm just waiting for it to be legal to shoot people like you.
I'm not a american and i dont live in america. But D.T is the best in this world
I'm out here already boy, & a wall ain't gonna stop us from finding jobs and a better life over here, trust.
I'm praying for you Mr. President! I know the Lord will give you the strength you need to keep fighting for our country!  God Bless you and your family!
I'm so proud to call you Mr Trump my President...youre hitting Pelosi right where she needs to be hit..in the wallet !
I'm sorry but you need to take care of the thousands of workers that are not being paid. I voted for you Mr President but having my husband work for over a month now with no check well that's just not right. Please get the government back opend
I'm standing with the President. Let Congress work for a change. They seem to have lost their way and can't speak their own minds They are afraid of their shadows. The American People have a right to representation and our boarders should be protected. It's ridiculous for Pelosi to send a letter regarding the State of the Union. She could careless about the people affected by the partial shutdown. She only cares about herself. Maybe more people should thinks for themselves as well.
I'm still Working and Getting  Paid. Don't know what y'all  are B**ching about! Lol üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I'm tired of one party trying to dictate their agenda to the rest of us. I'm talking about you, Democrats. Contrary to what you might think, you don't run this country alone. And you never will. No matter how many illegal votes you try to import over the border. It won't be the first time America said no to tyranny. You might not care for the President's policies. But there are those of us who don't care for yours either. If you're not compromising...guess what...you're dictating. Now get your sorry asses to the negotiating table and work out a deal with your fellow Americans to end the shutdown before the situation escalates any further. Trump may have let you off the hook by taking ownership of it. But many of us haven't. You say elections have consequences. Well this is yours for losing in 2016 to a candidate who ran on building a border wall. The people want secure borders and immigration reform. This begins by physically halting illegal activity at the border and curtailing exploiters. But you already know that. And are doing everything humanly possible to prevent it. You can't seem to get over the wall I like to call the plain, honest truth.
I'm voting Trump loud and proud
I'm waiting for you to cease being our president!
I'm with him 2020 baby
I'm with the Government shutdown. It sucks but the Dems are to blame. With you 100% Mr President.
I've just realised. President Trump could apologise for all the things he's ever done "wrong" in the eyes of the left, post it on Facebook and people would still react with that laughing emoji
I've never seen a leader come under so much fire for putting his people first.
IF THE BORDERS ARE NOT PROTECTED THERE IS GOING TO BE AN INVASIVE INMIGRATION!!!!!!
IF WE DON"T TELL THE TRUTH WE GO TO HELL BYE BYE FATTY!!!
IMBECILE
IMO, Putin's puppet, djt, is 'not cooking on all four burners'.......just sayin‚Äô! https://shareblue.com/experts-trump-human-trafficking-excuse-wall/?fbclid=IwAR0I_rtDOYQpl0cnO69TOlTBZkX1Yl890CziZaAOgH48YwAJ_bT6q-Z1wgI
IMPEACH THE MOTHER FUCKER
IMPEACH TRUMP!
IMPEACH!
INVITE A FEDERAL WORKER OVER FOR DINNER~  Trump is telling people who live paycheck to paycheck to "make adjustments" to live with no pay because he wants a wall.  You can‚Äôt adjust what you don‚Äôt have. One of the only good things to come out of this shutdown is that Trump is showing how out of touch and indifferent he is to the lives of ordinary people.
ISIS DEFEATED MISSION ACCOMPLISHED SYRIA BIG BOOM AMERICANS DEAD
ISIS is not coming through the southern border... they are attempting to FLY in... Let's build a ceiling !
IT DAMM SURE NOT THE DEMOCRATS!
IT SHOULD & MUST BE!  Thanks my POTUS.
IT SHOULD BE! that is the main thing as a country
Idiot
Idiot stfu
Idiot!!The U.S has always defended its border.Stop making a crisis out of nothing.
Idiot.
Idiots come out of the woodwork
If America & President Trump is such a laughing stock then why in the hell do we waste money on helping everyone else all over the world???? Cry babies wouldn't survive that's why y'all need us more than we need you so stop calling us !!!!
If Americans can't defend themselves in their homes our borders won't matter! In 2016 you pledged to defend the 2A and now support Red Flag laws and an anti-gun AG! We'll remember this in 2020! #CONVENTIONOFSTATES
If Americans of all "democrat" don't respect their own country, they can't demand respect from others!!!
If I as head of the household don't defend my home then we cease to be a family.
If I may make a suggestion Mr. President, take action in the face of the Democrat's inaction, call for an emergency to fund the wall, end the Gov.shut down on your terms.
If Mexico stopped sending drugs to America because of a wall, Americans will dig tunnels to Mexico
If Pelosi wants the SOTU address postponed, just go live from the Oval Office!
If Russia determines who our President is, then we Cease to be a Nation.   Many people are Saying so, very strongly and powerfully, believe me!   Bigly!
If Serbia does not defend its borders, then it ceases to be a nation. Kosovo and Metochia is Serbia. So president Trump, please defend also Serbian borders.
If Trump really cared about us, he's resign.  Anyway, Mueller is coming for you, orange maggot.
If Walls don't work, why do I have to have one around my Pool? Why are Walls around Schools and Day Cares? Why did Disney put one around their lakes? Why do Over 55 Communities have Walls and Guard Stations? Why does the Democratic Party have one around their Building? Get the point? President Donald J. Trump, if you have to shut the government down in order to get our Wall that will provide the safety and National Security that All Americans are entitled too, do whatever it takes! How many more loved ones do we have to bury before the Democrats do their job? My family buried an 18 year old American girl and her American 20 year old companion is a double leg amputee. Oh, the criminal illegal immigrant that is supposed to be deported at the end of his prison term(originally 17 years) will be out of prison in 2021 (2 yrs for a life and pair of legs), do you want him in your neighborhood? Here‚Äôs the Senate switchboard: (202) 224-3121. Call your Senator. Tell them you stand with the President. Demand the wall. #BuildOurWall
If a militia of armed American patriots traveled to the border and shot any illegals or migrants crossing into the US, what would be the penalty? Certainly it wouldn‚Äôt be murder as they would simply be protecting the country from foreign invaders and stopping a crime in progress?
If all is said and done and the political arguments are passed again and again, more fluently each time, like a complicated classic dance, the Potus has the ultimate responsibility for US security: "Buck stops here". That said, a compromise is always to be advocated if both parties want that. (some guarantees for "Dreamers" in exchange for funding the Wall. That wasn't perhaps a bad idea.Like in the Agent Starling/ Hannibal Lector scene: "Quid quo pro Doctor".)
If all presidents were that way over the years we would have had that wall long ago, both parties have been kicking the can down the road until now, Build the wall and about 3 days after it's started hold a news conference to announce it and stop the shutdown and put those people back to work. Blame it all on the Democrats for all the stalling and costs to the taxpayers, it's a win win for you on both points.
If are putos is compromised he becomes a Russian puppet
If boarder security was that important you would ensure DHS was funded no matter what!!! #paythecoastguard #paydhs
If feel he is holding this country hostage because he‚Äôs not getting his way. I try to be opened minded but not on this wall issue.
If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
If he builds a steel wall he's just wasting our money.
If he is such a joke then why do so many countries want to make a deal with him?  The joke is on the Democratic Party. This is the first time in a long time our country looks and feels strong. The weak spots in our country are in the Democratic Party.  They care more about their political party than they do this country. We are all seeing clearly each and every day. Schumer, Pelosi and Warren will hand the election to President Trump because they hate him so bad they get nothing done.  Voters are watching them and laughing. Like Warren drinking a beer is going to get the Southern vote... That was pretty lame.
If he uses executive order....the first time a Democrat takes office they'll knock down the wall. In the same way President Trump has already reversed EVERYTHING that b!tch obuma did.
If he would come to El Paso and speak about how "Hold the Line" implemented by former USBP Director EP Sector, former US Congressman, Reyes, it would be a great positive proof about how the "Wall" has lowered crime exponentially.  He has statistics and Facts to prove it.  Ya know what? Perhaps this is why buses of caravan invaders were dropped off in our city. Perhaps to undermine and chang those statics in favor of the Democratic false narrative.   Oh, those sneaky snakes. üêç
If it was so important why did you not fix it when Republicans had complete control. I'll wait on an answer for that!
If it weren't we wouldn't have an Army or the oath of office.
If it‚Äôs ‚Äúdefense of our nation‚Äù and not deterrence from our nation, just authorize lethal force. A lot cheaper than a barrier. If someone enters illegally, neutralize them. Soon word will get around and the invaders will find somewhere else to play.
If not a wall, US Military troops will stand guard.
If only the Dems would admit the truth about border security.
If only the democrats could see this. Or perhaps this is what Thay want.
If our borders are not protected then we have more of the criminals, drugs, gangs, killings! I live in Texas as many relatives do!  It is unsafe and we need the protection from the walls!  You democrats who have never been to a border state or know of the dangers are Spewing vitriol just like your fake news and leaders.  Friends in NewMexico and Arizona are going through the same thing! Calif. has become ‚Äútent city‚Äù and border towns are Wanting the protection also!
If our president is a russian asset then we cease to be a country
If our president is in the pockets of Russia, we cease to be a nation.
If security is top priority DO NOT DIVIDE ISRAEL!
If sheep could vote, they'd probably pick the guy that feeds them.....Even if it's the same guy that'll slaughter them later..
If so important why didn't you do something two years ago instead of that tax reform.  Because it was not important until you created a humanitarian crisis.  You the Liar!!!!!!!
If so, then stop the shutdown and MAKE A DEAL !
If that dip sh*t Pelosi & her caucus are so worried about people not being paid, she would park her Liberal a** in a chair in a meeting with the President ready to compromise. The reality is she does NOT care. She ONLY cares about making sure President Trump doesn‚Äôt fulfill his promises to Americans. üò°  It‚Äôs time President Trump had a ‚ÄòCome to Jesus Meeting‚Äô with Pelosi & Schumer to remind them of their job descriptions & remind them who is the President of the United States of America. Those two dingle berries have forgotten their place! üò°
If the "defense of our nation is my highest and most important duty" said a pathological hypocrite and there is no waring body threatening the US on our Southern border but one entire arm of our defense system, the United States Coast Guard, for the first time in history is not being paid, and screeners protecting our airports are being forced to look for paying jobs and calling in sick leaving the most vulnerable point of entry open for penetration what kind of DEFENSE is he providing!  A diversion from his real crimes is the only answer for subjecting the US to real danger.
If the President does not defend our borders who would then mr/mrs Democrat?
If the Russians controlled the President of the United States‚Äî what are things they would want him to do:  - shut down the U.S. Government   - ease sanctions, particularly key Putin associates   - undermine and propose pulling out of NATO  - disrupt U.S. allied relationships  - start disruptive trade wars   - discredit U.S. intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial systems   - fill the Government leadership with people who have no relevant experience, give them a mandate of dismantle and neglect, and throw in a healthy dash of graft and corruption  - pull out of Syria  - pull out of Afghanistan   - turn our back on the Ukraine   - turn our back on the Kurds   - support extreme white supremacy groups   - support Brexit and disrupt the EU  - undermine the free press  - undermine the U.S. electoral process  - destroy all records and keep secret the content of discussions from 5 in person meetings with trump since being elected   What else??
If the U.S. can build hundreds of miles of wall to protect Jordan why can't we build one here?  I'm pissed.
If the defense of our nation is so important to you then why did you shut down the government and now disgruntled TSA workers aren‚Äôt doing their job correctly therefore endangering the lives of hundreds of Americans. Democrats are just as much to blame as well. And trump supporters are so dumb they only blame them and don‚Äôt see that trump has as much blame. You people are dumbasses ü§£
If the defense of our nation is your highest and most important duty, END THE SHUTDOWN! Then we can have a civil discussion about border protection.
If this Buzzfeed story is true you‚Äôre done, Donnie.
If trump would go back to Hell. We might have a country
If we are a good nation we work with other nations and not shut them out
If we can avoid a 5.7 billion dollar monument to Donald Trump, we could actually increase our border security!
If we can‚Äôt defend the constitution we cease to be a nation. Resign!
If we do not get rid of you and your cronies America will become a fascist state.
If we do not get this treasonous lying piece of crap  out of our government we will no longer exist as a free nation!
If we don't defeat Pelosi we cease to be relevant.
If we don't defend our constitution from YOUR fascist attempt at dictatorship, we shall cease to be a free nation.
If we don't defend our country AGAINST YOU, then we cease to be a nation. Traitorous LIAR!
If we don't defend our country because of you and your corrupt administration, we are dead!
If we don't get our boarder completely secure, our country will be taken over and then it will be to late to do anything.
If we don't get rid of Trump, we cease to be taken seriously as a nation.
If we don't have an OPEN government, we cease to be a nation.   OPEN the Government.    NOW....................
If we don't hold Hillary Clinton accountable she will fly around the world on her private jet calling Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and tell them everything she wants them to do to obstruct Donald Trump until she can run against him again in 2020. Oops
If we don't impeach this crook, we cease to be a nation!
If we don't impeach this imposter, we cease to be a nation.
If we don't pay our employees and contractors, we're Donald Trump, the businessman.
If we don't pay our employees this country could pile on more issues!
If we don't protect our children, our seniors, our citizens from polluted drinking water, toxic air, harmful food and provide them medical care then we cease to be serving, defending and representing the people...you are a traitor to America.
If we don't remove the dual citizenship people from Congress,  we can kiss the US goodbye.
If we dont care for our citizens we cease to have humanity
If we dont defend our democracy, we end up with a white nationalist dictator like you. RESIGN-do it now, get yr pardon and GET OUT of the people's house!!
If we dont protect our endangered species then we wont have an earth to live on. You are destroying their protection. I voted for you, but you have signed away protections for jobs. Jobs are not everything, there is a balance and you are incapable in seeing that. Look up rulers and the consequences of their actions when it comes to the destruction of their environment or protections. When the bees are gone, what is your family going to eat? Everybody knows money isnt everything. There is a balance, you in business should know that.  I'm for the wall, for tariffs that have been extremely off set, I am hoping there will be someone running that is a business man AND AWORLD WILDLIFE MAN
If we dont stop doctirs doing genocide on organs and also frauding our nations tax insurance murder morphine we dont need a wall we need bridges yo ger away from Congress bullshit laws which herd us to genocide plants   Drink only water if you trust your water. No straws and .wake sure you dont let humans poop chenicals that eat your flesh. Brain especially. All products with brain flesh eating can get you shot by a rescuer because you are uncontrollable hallucinating abd in a danger to public   Anheuser Busch liars thieves abd murdering organs  and Pepsi co been told to stop wounding stomach pancreas.
If we don‚Äôt build the wall it it is a open invitation to all drug dealers , human traffickers, violent gangs , diseases not to mention expense
If we don‚Äôt defend America against you, then we cease to be a nation.  If you cared you would open up the government!  But, you sir can careless.  Lies, corruption and a traitor. Your future looks bright. Till your exit,  we true Americans will fight for ‚Äúour‚Äù nation and it‚Äôs people!   You‚Äôll be a dark ugly spot in History. And nobody knows better about ugly darkness then you.
If we don‚Äôt defend our borders, then we cease to be a nation.  If we don‚Äôt defend our Republic from those who do not enforce and uphold their Oath of office. They should resign as per the House committee on Ethics.
If we don‚Äôt defend our borders, then we cease to be a nation. THAT IS THE LEFT'S GOAL!
If we don‚Äôt fix health care, poverty, gun control, and inequality, we cease to be a nation. Much more important than Southern border, where illegal entry is already at all time low. Why does our President focus on wrong issues??
If we don‚Äôt have people to defend our nation, a wall is just a wall
If we don‚Äôt pay our employees, then we cease to be good people.
If we don‚Äôt pay our working people we cease to be humanitarians and weaken our economy
If we don‚Äôt restore decency, compassion and competence to the Oval Office, then we cease to be a nation.
If we don‚Äôt stop them at the border, we‚Äôll be stopping them at our front door.
If we don‚Äôt take care of our veterans who is going to protect the nation?   Why don‚Äôt you fix that first instead of a wall the majority don‚Äôt want.
If we elect a Putin Puppet, we cease to be a nation
If we elect a Russian asset then we cease to be a nation too.
If we elect an Immoral, Dishonest, Narcissistic Sociopath to President, do we cease to be a nation too???
If we go to other country we can't go in the way these caravan want to come in we have to go the right way thats why we need the border
If we have a President who works for Putin, we cease to be an independent nation. You want to defend our nation, start with defending it against Russian influence.
If we keep Trump as president, we cease to be a nation.
If we keep you in office, the country goes into the shitter. You should be the one going into the shitter, face-first!!
If we sell out to hostile leaders like Putin we cease to be a country even faster traitor.
If we sell out to russia and ignore trumps collusion we will cease to be a nation.
If we started a go fund me page and everyone who wants the wall donated at least $20 the wall would be no problem
If we the people dont get your treasonous  clan out of the peoples house . There will be a russian flag flown on the capital lawn!
If we won't defend ourselves, then we cease to be human. That goes for all of you who sit back and allow the corruption in the government to continue. We need a change and it's not another president we need another leader. Who can format a better system, that doesn't rely so heavily on money. Yeah that'll still be a currency, but there's so much that should be free. Instead of having to pay for food and water people could volunteer time to work. It's natural resources people grows from the ground that means it is free. Stop allowing them to charge you to live here.
If you believe trump, you deserve whatever comes from him.
If you can't defend your own borders, stop defending other countries. Charity begins at home.
If you don't defend the constitution we cease to be a free nation Donald Trump you have turned your back on the very people who voted you into office and your oath to uphold the constitution. You promised no legislation would be passed infringing on our 2nd amendment rights. Your support of the red flag laws is the biggest infringement of our rights in our lifetime and now you support an attorney General that supports these unconstitutional laws. Red flag is illegal imorral and unconstitutional and needs to be abolished. We have a right to due process for a reason.
If you don't get rid of the corruption from within your nothing more than a phony.
If you don't stand for ALL your citizens, (calling democrats traitors), then you cease to be a "precedent".
If you don't, who will? üòè #Trump2020
If you dont open the government we have no nation.
If you dont pay the army you cease to be the president!
If you dont pay your workers...you're an ASSHOLE.
If you don‚Äôt get the hell outta office.  There isn‚Äôt gonna be a America or government
If you don‚Äôt open the government we will cease to be a nation. You are completely incompetent and negotiate like a toddler who should have had a nap two hours ago.
If you don‚Äôt pay American Federal Workers & they suffer, it‚Äôs on you.  Very sad...
If you don‚Äôt pay your employees you cease being human.
If you hyper-militarize one land border while ignoring the MAJORITY of the ways undocumented immigrants and drugs get into this country, and you destroy democracy, people's health and well-being, and the environment, then we cease to be a nation.  Asshat.
If you keep your government in shutdown, then it cease to be a nation yo!
If you shut down the whole government, we will be Russians and China will own the Whitehouse. Wile E. West
If you spent more time on policy than conjuring up MEMES, maybe you wouldn't be well on your way to impeachment... No, you'd still be a ruthless, spineless traitor.
If you want money for the wall you should declare all Military flights by. Legislators Dry Flights.  Nancy will come to the table faster than the Road Runner.  No wonder she is still here. Alcohol is a preservative.   .https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosis-in-flight-food-and-drink-costs-101000-2010-1
If you'll kindly stop spewing these chaotic defecations of reality about the border from your grass hut skull we can get to the higher priority of protecting our constitution from you,  Mr. Russian Asset.
If you're a Democrat you are fighting for your own demise. If you don't believe me just keep an eye on the news the next couple months or so.
If your God blesses a self-described "pussy-grabber" and an adulterer, then your god is not in heaven but in hell.
If y‚Äôall hater don‚Äôt like the President. Go live with Obama And or  Bill and HillaryüòÇ
If ‚Äúdefense of our nation‚Äù is your highest priority, then YOU ARE FAILING!!    You stopped paying the TSA, the Dept of Defense, the Dept of Homeland Security, and a HOST of other agencies!! Stop the temper tantrum.  Reopen govt, MAGA=RESIGN
Ignorant ass
Ignore the haters, Stand strong! This is why we hired you. For the last 60 years,. we have watched. One Republican after another cave. As our country slides into socialism. You are our last hope!!
Iies and propaganda.
Ijeoma Amaka repent
Illegal immigrants are trespassers, I don't see anyone allowing strangers moving onto their property and squatting to live....why should we allow them into the country to do the same? It's ok because they're not at your house?
Illegals are getting BILLIONS of OUR tax dollars from the IRS. If this doesnt infuriate you, I dont know what will.   üá∫üá∏ BUILD THE WALL!!!   https://www.wthr.com/article/tax-loophole-investigation
Illegals are the  Dems new black voter's.  They want need Black voters once the LIBS give Illegals free healthcare, housing, education.
Im canadian, please tell me what I dont understand. Are you starving your people because you cant build a wall?
Im here and waiting for service. Ready to make Australia great again with your support Sir.
Im just very curious,im not rep or dem! But i would love to understand how the fck is a wall ever guna hold anyone back from coming to US did we forge they can also come threw ocean or tunnels?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i really don't understand gow this stupid wall is guna change anything

Im the best player here and left end!
Imagine if #Trump fined everyone who didn't want the Wall. Just like #Obama did with ObamaCare...ü§î #thedoublestandartisreal
Imagine if TRUMP fined everyone that didn't want the wall. Kinda like OBAMA and Obama Care.
Imagine if Trump fined everyone who didn't want the wall. Kinda like Obama did with Obamacare.
Imagine if Trump fined everyone who didn't want the wall. You know, exactly like Obama did with Obamacare.
Imagine if Trump fined everyone who doesn't want the wall. Kinda like obama did with obamacare.....
Imagine that, a US president taking his oath of office seriously. It's about time. So glad we don't have the apologizer-in-chief any longer. More US politicians need to do the same.
Impeach Nancy Pelosi.
Impeach Trump
Impeach the mother f*cker! #JustDoIt‚úÖ
Impeach the sorry Bastard.....
Impeach this Russian owned traitor ~
Impeach time! You are nothing but a traitor to this country Donald.
Impeachment is coming.
Impossible to make everyone happy but thank you for trying to protect everyone.
In September 2018 trump submitted his budget requests to Congress for the year 2019...in it he asked for $1.6 billion dollars for 'border security", which Congress approved.   Not my opinion, the congressional records tell the tale for all who want to know that truth of what really happened.  Trump came back 4 months later with new demands, was told NO, and is temper tantruming because that childish strategy has always worked for him before.  Mean old Nancy Pelosi however, has decades of experience dealing with old white entitled rightwing males and young children.
In Syria? Run away.
In a dictatorship world....looks like you've pulled the wool over a lot of Americans eyes....your all a bunch of fools if you can't see your government is in turmoil. Rise against the machine and take your country back. Don't let rednecks rule the world....lol
In all reality it should be all the crime happening in the United States you‚Äôre worried about stuff that hasn‚Äôt even happened yet
In looking through all of the comments it makes me think of that ole saying "Try as you might...You will never make everybody happy" Going Back to the comments....90% of the posts are pro-trump so I would say he is on the right track!
In my itchy bitchy teeny winnie polka dot opinion, President Trump should give the Executive Order to Nancy Pelosi, Schumer, and all democrat and republican politicians to work WTIHOUT PAY during this Partial Government Shut Down Period......To use their pay to pay all 800,000 federal employees working during such period. Furthermore, No back pay must be pay for them!
In order for the US to be safe, you need to resign. I'm tired of you running this country like you ran your bankrupt casinos.
In order to protect us against terrorist, Mr. President, I would strongly urge you to expel their leader Nancy Pelosi . . . and her sidekick, Chuck Schumer.
In that day the song will be sung in the land of Judah; "We have a strong city, He sets up walls and ramparts for security."  Isaiah 26:1   We need walls for out protection.....Heaven even has walls.
In the Illuminati Secret Order Of Society Satanic Worshiping Group Contract, it says Congress is the almighty powerful that they are so powerful, they will take every penny then can from the tax payers and vote themselves a raise for doing it.

In the last election I don't see how anyone could have voted, the people were not given an adequate selection of candidates yet, forced to vote for what they think is the lesser of 2 evils, sad neither side can still get anything done,.. Years later the same thing is happening thus proving the systems broken. Yall think its going to get better you are sadly mistaken
In this picture, I bet you were pointing at a senior aid and saying "You... leave the room. I have to talk with Vlad privately."
In today‚Äôs news: Individual-1 spouts same old rhetoric, but doesn‚Äôt actually do anything but keep various branches of government (one of which is primarily responsible for protecting our borders) shut down and unfunded.  You can‚Äôt make this stuff up, folks.
Including the influence of Russia. Stop posting pictures of yourself!!!
Indeed
Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!

Indian Opposition Leaders learn from this by Criticizing Modiji in his pursuit to Make the Defense of our Nation impenetrable u r doing harm to Nation‚Äôs Security
Indigenous people supposed to talk like this rather than a president from immigrant background.
Individual 1 is unfit to be a president. He talks politics to the troops and Boy Scouts. Both are apolitical organizations. #Donthecon
Individual 1 trashed Comey for being a good friend of Mueller which is not true. Comey and Mueller did not socialize, they had working relationship. What is true, his AG nominee, William Barr, admitted that he has been a friend of Mueller for 30 years. #Donthecon
Infidels
Informed people know about President Trumps 289 accomplishments in his first 2 years, people that trust the fake media, not so much.
Instead of a wall why can‚Äôt we build a canal stretching from Texas to California instead? Just a different idea idk!ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Instructing people to lie to congress is a fun way to be remembered.
Interesting picture, reminds me of the Stalinist posters.
Is Agree
Is Nancy Pelosi Afraid to let president Donald J.Trump address the nation from the Peoples House? Her safety has been guaranteed by the Homeland Security Director.
Is Russia doing the propaganda photos here?  Very nice.
Is freaking Sad and embarrassing that we have someone who act like a little two-year-old little snot-nosed  Brat
Is giving me my fuckin tax return...bitch
Is that a real name?
Is that one your headache
Is that photoshop? Lmao
Is that why Homeland security and the TSA aren't funded right now?
Is that why you collude with Russia? Is that why you've lifted sanctions to make sure your masters get paid? Is that why you speak to your boss Vlad in private? You're a traitor and one day soon Americans will know all the details, that's if Bill Barr doesn't hide them for you.
Is that why you're not paying the TSA and Homeland Security?
Is there any better entertainment than pathetic crying libs?
Is there not some way of removing Nancy p and chuck as part of them obstructing national security and causing a risk to all in America
Is this a Jojo reference
Is this a common Paranoia for people with small penises?
Is this ever going to end this I getting way out of hand for everyone we need pray for a miracle to happen
Is this just another Russian post or has Trump learned how to di it too???   I hear Vlad is a good teacher!
Is this the PHOTOSHOPPED photo everyone is talking about? Making your waist look smaller (not possible with all that fast food you eat) and making those baby hands look BIGGER?
Is this your ideology on all nations or just yours? Cause you kinda have your garbage (military bases) in so many nations.  America with walls would not have allowed your ancestors in from the ghettos of Europe. Trump is a fraud!

It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...
It amazes me how democrats are so unwilling to see any good in Trump even when he mimics all their favorites from the recent past. Some who want to run for President against him are truly dangerous. Beto wants to eliminate the constitution and others are willing to institute sharia law
It appears someone has read our constitution and understands THE security and safety of the United States citizen IS the #1 priority for the position of The President of the United States of America! üá∫üá∏
It is also the sworn duty of members of Congress. How do you intend to encourage them to do what they swore to do?
It is and paying people is your job too! U can open the government  and work on BORDER security.  U don't need to be a baby about it when nearly a milluon people  aren't getting paid
It is funny all this started when you started is you are doing the same thing they did in the 50 and 60 trying to keep people afraid
It is news when Trump doesn‚Äôt lie.
It is not normal to hold 800,000 workers‚Äô paychecks hostage. It is not normal to shut down the government when we don‚Äôt get what we want. It is not normal for public servants to run away and hide from the public that they serve, and it is certainly not normal to starve the people you serve for a proposal that is wildly unpopular among the American people. Trumps shut down of the government is something we are ALL going to pay for.
It is only a wicked father who refuses to protect his family, and it is only a wicked mother who prays that her God given family be scattered, the  husband and children be killed or their blood be sucked . Is there anyone not supporting the border wall be built, if there is anyone like that,  such  a person wants America, Its Citizens and humanity terrorised. I can see Chuck and Nancy don't care to know how America is doing. Democrats  are the cause of Government shutdown, President Trump wants them to support the building of the border wall to keep America and Its Citizens safe.
It is sad that our previous commander in chief did not concider this a sacred duty of the president.
It is sickening  to see people giving  fake news that they made up & giving opinions on it...all for money.  One day when your country doesn't look like it once did because of your lies, you will reap what you caused! Lacey üôè
It is so nice to have a President that loves America and wants to put the American people first for a change
It is the responsibility of the Commander in Chief to protect our National security against all foreign and domestic threats.   Pelosi is a domestic threat.   President Regan spoke to America for 4 min. from the Oval Office after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in place of giving the SOTU address.  President Trump, if necessary, ought to speak of our National Security Emergency also from the Oval office and forgo addressing Congress, and ridiculous Pelosi's antics.
It is time for President Trump to cut a wall for dreamers deal. It is also time for our Congressman to stop embarrassing themselves by not making a deal
It is tyranny from inside instead of outside if we don't. We have to much of that already, Donald J. Trump.
It is why I call him "Mr.Triumph"!!
It like saying why do people have gates around their house....to protect people who don‚Äôt belong on their property!
It looks like Sphincter Pelosi takes the Birdbox Challenge every time she puts on her face in the morning.
It really is.  If your country is not secure, anything bad can happen to it.  Thank God for Pres. Trump.  He puts the country first.
It seems to be doing fine compared to the US.
It should be Pelosi's too....but she wants to go off on a nice trip to Egypt....must be nice...ON YOUR TAX DOLLAR...while Americans aren't getting paid because she doesn't care about their safety or future.
It should be a priority of all elected officials.  Guess pelosi and Schumer have other priorities like catering to illegals instead of Americans.
It should be defend another
It shows, he is just winging it and if it goes bad just blame the flag or this wall
It takes a strong man like pres tump to help our country n th   Deal with those idiots
It the President, Any Presidents Main Job. Protect Americans 1st, everything else later.
It was the Republicans who fought to free blacks from slavery and amended the Constitution to grant blacks freedom (13th Amendment), citizenship (14th Amendment) and the right to vote (15th Amendment). Republicans passed the civil rights laws of the 1860s, including the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Reconstruction Act of 1867 that was designed to establish a new government system in the Democrat-controlled South, one that was fair to blacks. Republicans also started the NAACP and affirmative action with Republican President Richard Nixon‚Äôs 1969 Philadelphia Plan (crafted by black Republican Art Fletcher) that set the nation‚Äôs fist goals and timetables. Although affirmative action now has been turned by the Democrats into an unfair quota system, affirmative action was begun by Nixon to counter the harm caused to blacks when Democrat President Woodrow Wilson in 1912 kicked all of the blacks out of federal government jobs.
It will only cost $5.7 billion to open the government back up! DO IT!!!!
It will slow them down for sure. I can't figure why the Dems were all for wall when OBAMA was in but not now. Why didn't Obama fix it OH BECAUSE HE WAS TO BUSY ON AN APLOLOGY TOUR ,FAST N FURIOUS,4 AM TARMAC MEETING SPENDING 65,000 ON PIZZA & HOTDOGS,AND FUNNELING MONEY .THIS GUY GOT RICH QUICK AND CLINTON BOUNCED BACK AFTER SHE SAID SHE WAS BROKE.
It would be far cheaper and save alot of Money to Just Build the Wall...
It would sound a lot better, if you were not a spoiled crook,  liar, cheater,  corrupt , vindictive thief.
It would take a really Stupid person too believe Trump would be anyone's Agent or Puppet , Trump not as a Business Man and for sure not as the Most Powerful Man on the Planet , You leftist morons need to think before you Type , Speak or even breed !  Trump Has a Big Ego , Oh Trump's A Puppet ,   Trump Stupid ""  YET Trump  is worth 3.5 Billion dollars and Liberals are only good and taxing other Americans !
It's Pelosi and Schumer ' s least important duty.
It's a TRAP !!!!!!! üòà
It's a common sense statement, don't know why everyone is so upset about it. Any normal idiot locks their car when they park and you all lock up your houses at night. Why wouldn't you do it to your own COUNTRY? Dumb asses everywhere, it seems.
It's a crisis, build the wall
It's a distraction and a waste of money.
It's a shame that people are so ignorant that the president has to tell them this!
It's about time we got a President that actually cares about  his countrymen/women.
It's also supposed to be the job of Congress. Even Democrats!
It's called "objectivity."  "Rational and critical thought."
It's incredible that so many can block the president's every move - and get away with it.
It's incredible to see someone fail so miserably...
It's nice that Putin allows you to speak freely  lol
It's now the highest priority of this president to  fund the border wall...a country with an open border is not a nation.. It has to have a border wall to protect the citizenry.from harm and to preserve its sovereignty.against tyrants.
It's ok if you don't understand politics just don't spew your stupidity around
It's ok to defend everyone else's borders but not our own. That's pretty damn messed up.
It's sad how much power all u white fucks have in this world and enough just isn't enough when will you all be tired of hating the world u live in that's why you all age so badly u are very wicked people and his only option is to start war and we will only fail and the leaders of the world will tuck their tails run and hide ur not scaring me u evil mother fuckers it was u who God mentioned in the bible it will be you who will start war and fail our economy it's u and those who hide behind those big white walls with your secrets and your lies God mentioned u and the 7th seal will soon be open and all leaders of our world will meet their judgement day
It's sad that race always has to be brought into this,  a President should be elected on his abilities, I don't agree with everything he says, but I respect the position,  and he has made major changes even though he has been attacked from every side. When will people realize that a divided society will not stand, we are destroying ourselves from within,  this has to stop, we are a joke fighting between ourselves.  We must become the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA again. Maybe you can be a voice Sheldon Satchel! #WAKEUPAMERICA #DIVIDEDWEFALL #BUILDTHEWALL
It's that simple!
It's time to build the wall without Pelosi. She's not going to move on this and we need the wall with all the other immigrants coming. I think declare an emergency and get it done. Yes, there will be a court fight but that's going to happen if you wait to do it too, better to get on with it.
It's to late
It's true. All persons defend their house borders.. it's the same. Not sure for democratic, They think.. not in my house but in my country yes.
Its amazing that we lasted 245 years without borders, but now "we will cease to be a nation" because of it
Its amazing what this country turned into! Just because the dems dont like my president that is doing a great job they refuse to give him anything. In my mind this is the worst case of treason ive ever seen dems should be in jail unreal! Keep up the good fight mr president and ty for all your dealing with to try to save our country!!
Its called gather as much cash before you're locked up. POS POTUS
Its funny how so many are flipping to being common sense Republicans. And so many Democrats are losing base..
Its just common sense ,any leader in any country their primary duty is the defence of that country and its citizens
Its now being reported that 2000 Hondurans rushed the Mexican Border last night and made it through and the activist Alfonso Ulloa stayed...‚ÄùGringos we are going to invade you just like you invaded us‚Äù  It‚Äôs time for Trump to declare a National Emergency!!!
Its obvious what the dems are doing, I'm quite tired of the BS, its time to take back America!! Who knew it was our own holding America back. Truly a sad sad time in life. Glad to know who our enemies really are.
Its sad that the demonRATS hate for Trump out weighs their love for America
Its seems elementary, but its seems half the country wants to stay in Kindergarten for a lifetime........üôà
Its so sad that a person would use their politcal power for foolery.  America is the biggest shitshow circus right now and Donald Trump the leading clown.  I blame your parents for not whipping your ass when you caught a temper tandrum over Leggos. If they did you probably would reconsider this stupidity of a wall. ALL FEDERAL EMPLOYEES SHOULD UNITE AND WALKOUT! What is a wall going to do if you dont have any federal employees guarding it?
Its working great in HEAVEN! The only open borders lead straight to Hell! I have noticed no prisons having issues with walls nor the Vatican or any of Congress! Ask Obama he sure built a big ole wall around his place! Hypocrites. Gotta love'em ha!
It‚Äôd just a campaign promise to your base.  Keep it up your base isn‚Äôt enough to get you elected in 2020 .
It‚Äôs Mueller timeüòÜ
It‚Äôs amazing how idiots don‚Äôt understand that.
It‚Äôs nothing more than your rhetoric kremlin has your number
It‚Äôs the president right and is his first responsibility in his job to keep our home land secure for the safe of his citizens. Build the wall you are doing what they push you to do Mr president Donald trump. Keep strong and build the wall we all want the Big and safety Wall.
Ivan Flores Just like you just said brother
I‚Äôll volunteer for a Years duty patrolling our southern boarder
I‚Äôm behind you Mr President!
I‚Äôm excited to vote again Mr. President. Trump Train üöÇüíïüá∫üá∏üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶üá∫üá∏üíØ
I‚Äôm giving you a FINAL WARNING https://youtu.be/ToOFtvvFGGo
I‚Äôm gonna tell you fascists You may be surprised The people in this world Are getting organized You‚Äôre bound to lose You fascists bound to lose  Woody Guthrie
I‚Äôm not looking for a scapegoat Cecilia. I‚Äôm looking for security at our borders. There‚Äôs a legal way to enter our country as opposed to the mobs that are trying to enter. Also for security against trafficking, drugs and crime that are proven to be an issue at the border.
I‚Äôm so proud of our President!  I‚Äôm right with you in 2020. Thank you for all that you do!
I‚Äôm sure you Christians are just fine with this, eh? Pro lifer? Hardly  ‚Äú"Vance County Schools has announced that beginning Jan. 21, the school district will begin to provide students with ‚Äúminimum level‚Äù school lunches to conserve funds in the wake of the federal government shutdown.  State nutrition officials say the directive to cut back on school lunches didn‚Äôt come from Raleigh."
I‚Äôm with Trump
JL Schermerhorn OUR MILITARY IS BEING PAID!! YOURE WELCOME!
JL Schermerhorn no its the OTHER ADMINISTRATION'S THAT everyone cheered and gave wall money to....who LIED AND DID NOTHING!! Where is your blame for them? Oh thats right the liberal paid media only Trump bash 24/7 for over two years BECAUSE THEY ARE PAID TO BY THE DNC/HILLARY CLINTON! Because she lost.....TWICE!! Maybe we would not be in this situation if they walked their talk....but Democrats just talk the talk! That was proven with 8 crap years of Obama!
Jack Gatty trolls just hear what they want to hear. Fake news.
Jack Gatty.he didn't get north korea to the table.  That's a big lie.
Jackie Lewis yeah because hes a Republican yet are you saying dems are not patriotic?
Jackie McHugh Neither he nor his administration has submitted ANY form of legislation addressing the specifics for his vanity wall or a larger immigration reform plan.
Jaimie McCammon You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress. Can you think of a reason he didn‚Äôt do it when he could?
Jajsjsjajaj
James Boose me too! I pray everyday that Jesus Christ Our Lord, will take Trump to Heaven during his sleep!
James Boose right...... lol and the dems didn't have any resources to do the same thing! In fact that is why Hillary was so shocked! ü§£
James Campbell I am sure he will take advice from a Walmart cashier right away. I am sure you knowledge of the world has led you to your esteemed position in life sunshine. Hopefully you wont be drug tested today.
James Campbell ISIS the military force is defeated. ISIS the idea lives on, and the idea is what the radicals are loyal to. Expect to see a lot of sleeper cells popping off in the coming days, as they run out of options with their supply chain and leadership destroyed and default to "blaze of "glory"".
James Campbell Why? So Chuck and Nancy can turn this country into a socialist/communist country? Wake up and learn some history.
James Campbell calm down. They have found a cure for TDS!!  Hold your breath for 30 minutes straight and you will be cured. Have a wonderful day sunshine.
James Campbell remember when they busted them in that lie about all 17 supported that? üòÇü§£
James Campbell wonderful comeback!! I can tell you will be shift manager soon!! Well, as long as there are no suprise drug tests you should be fine.
James Darren Ratcliff because the other choices, so far, are a woman who claims to be black but is actually Native American/Jamaican, a man who can‚Äôt keep his hands off young women, a woman who already lost the presidency once and seems to have severe health issues AND Trump is actually doing a good job for America
James Hindle plus...you‚Äôre Canadian. What a joke
James Hindle shut up, boomer. Your generation screwed up America...let it heal from your cancer
James Kenney   Wind Bag
James Kenney And now BLOCKED...Bye Bye
James Kenney And where do ILLEGALS fit into your delusional List ??!!!
James Kenney Dude stop trolling. The man has billions. I‚Äôm quite sure he has a better grasp on numbers then your petulant self will.
James Kenney Obama sure did.  Thank goodness we have Trump.  MAGA 2020!!
James Kenney WOW...You really are DELUSIONAL..Hope you are Wealthy or soon you will be on the DOLE like the ILLEGALS !!!!..It amazes me that you can't see that the CORRUPT DEMS want a One World Order will CONTROL of us all, and while they get RICH we will be told what , how, when we can do ANYTHING....Take a look at Venezuela DUMBASS !!!
James Kenney please know facts before posting. Trump's father gave him $1 million which he turned into $4 billion.  No flunky.   He is one of the most elite entrepreneurs in US history and an amazing negotiator.  Art of the deal -playing out for us since he stepped into the WH
James Kenney thanks James.
James Kenney the faceless facebooker. Someone who makes a billion from a few million is a dummy. Ok. What does that make you.
James Kenney ya he's a billionaire that's can't add lol
James Kenney yes but a new car and expensive cell phones are not a necessity. Like I said people spend what they make. There are ways to save and make cuts. Each person is responsible for their expenses. I realize sometimes expenses come up that aren‚Äôt planned. I am old school and if you can‚Äôt pay for it you don‚Äôt buy it. I know people have to have a home and I am not talking about that.
James Kenney you are a comminst agitator alias a traitor
James Walker What side is better, right or left side?
James Walker name calling. Typical. Fake polls by who? According to Cohen...that was Trump.
James Walker oh that's right. Paid vacation. I forgot.
James Walker the Senate voted on a spending bill 100-0. The Democratic House passed that same bill. Now all we need is for Mitch McConnell to pass it and we're on our way to funding the government. Trump is throwing a tantrum for a vanity wall which the majority of people don't want.
James Woodruff you‚Äôve been brainwashed
James only got 9? friends Maybe you could send a friend request to leave and you to Homo‚Äôs can make out
Jamie Hammack I‚Äôm not belittling anyone.  I asked a fucking question, grow up.
Jamie Hammack also, check out the responses to my question.  People are insulting my family, including my dead grandmother, a few cousins (who I might add have struggled with weight issues, and one who is somewhat ability impaired), and my sister.  You wanna talk about belittling, address those from ‚Äúyour party‚Äù who think that behavior is acceptable.     INSULTING MY DEAD GRANDMOTHER.  Let that sink in.
Jamie Hammack read my original post.  This is about Trump editing his appearance to appear more fit on social media.  I‚Äôm sorry, but his entire existence is mired in falsehoods, and his social media team editing his appearance to make him more attractive is yet another way of manipulating people into thinking he is something that he is not.    So by my asking the question of why he feels the need to do that I‚Äôm belittling others who are overweight?  That‚Äôs a stretch bro.  By ‚Äúmy party‚Äù I‚Äôm assuming you mean ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù.  Nah man, keep trying though.
Janice Bradford Who are you to tell other Americans to leave "our" country? Because I have another opinion? Well, it looks like you have a mental problem.
Janice Bradford Wrong, Trump and his supporters want the stupid wall. America doesn't need it.
Janice Bradford, Right! I will be watching for this fake and she will be exposed every single time. Always for Trump!!

Jarrod Williams I would reply...but you‚Äôre obviously a Nancy.  Good day
Jasmine Simpson  At your age , why wouldn‚Äôt listen to your left wing analogy , lmao , talk to us in 30 years ,  When you grow up , a lot !!!!!
Jasmine Simpson little girl you have no idea about the real world. Do a little reading, you might learn something...If we do not secure our borders, you don't have a country.
Jasmine Simpson we need the wall especially in California
Jason  he looks like he‚Äôs just about the unleash [The Wall] on everyone who opposes his stand.
Jason Erhardt is that a CNN poll/stat üòÇ
Jason Jindo we can have it all
Jason Jindo we need walls not just for Russia üá∑üá∫!
Jason Martinez your ass should be put on a bus back south
Jason Mills walls and fencing works! Ask Nancy & Chuck. They have them around their palaces to keep people like you out!
Jason Rush I live on the border. Miles and miles of open desert, most illegals don't show up at the gates, DS.
Jay Boogie Boogie Woogie Roogsky?????
Jean Lavoie Black people are just as susceptible to stupidity, advertising, subliminal influence as anyone else. You just have to learn to spot it for what it is. Unfortunately, republicans have never learned this which is why so many of them support Trump in spite of all the evidence of wrongdoing by his campaign team and Trump himself. You're fans, not thinkers.
Jeanne this isn't The Apprentice, he can't fire anybody in the Congress.
Jeannie Hill , Finally every Vile Hypocritical Dem came out of the closet.  Openly Embracing socialism MARXISM AND COMMUNISM.  While supporting And Electing to the House of Representives Sworn in on Qurans and Arabic Shariah Islam Tists wives who Kill Gays Transgenders Lesbians their own daughters wives and children and women of all races.  Dems also hate hard working educated Non Shariah Islamists who support Capitalism Freedom and America.
Jeff An June Carnahan, please post a link of the missiles flying our way that trump stopped. Apparently the fake news media hid this story from us and only you can prove it.
Jeff Ersland can't say much for your looks either. Eeeeewwwww
Jeff Gibson can you explain that statement or you just here to hurl baseless insults?
Jeffrey Brown you must be referring to Pelosi and Schumer!
Jenn Eccher maybe some mydol would help you cupcake. Obviously the woman is a non essential employee and should look for a job where she is actually essential instead of working in a job she isnt needed.
Jennifer Byars White  I will propose the armed forces keep our sovereignty, not the proposed wall.  For example, Constantinople had magnificent walls, for a thousand years, but the fell as gun powder came into use with cannon.  In 1456.
Jennifer Knapic  Yes!!!  BUILD IT BABY!!!
Jennifer Myers  Get a job Commie and enjoy the benefits of OUR Great President, you're a commie obviously.
Jennifer Myers his verifiable completed campaign promises to his voters says otherwise and proves you're only using your own hate/bias as your facts. :)
Jennifer Myers very untrue
Jennifer Myers you and what army? The traitors are the Dumbocrats/liberal/socialist/communists! You must be one!
Jenny Reisner it is so pathetic!
Jeramy Felton Hargis He is the one working while the Democrats vacation.  Love you President Trump
Jeramy Felton Hargis, why is it anti Trump people can‚Äôt even see the noses on their own faces? You have this idea a wall is only a physical structure, but with seismic instruments, drones, and other technologies, it becomes a smart wall. Of course there are still other areas to address, but a wall is a good beginning   As far as homeless and flint goes, doesn‚Äôt Pelosi have 54 billion in discretionary expenses? Why not send some of that money to those concerns?  Also, Trump is asking for about 1/60th of the annual interest that accrued on 22 trillion in debt.   Talk about anti Trump people not having even the insight God bestowed on even a pet hamster.
Jeremy Stephens   You mean like "Mexico will pay for the wall"? Oh wait, that's right, the new NAFTA deal will pay for it! LOL! Still chuckling over that one!
Jeremy Stephens   it is going to come out--- he is corrupted in every way-  Its people like you who are brain washed to believe his lies--A wall come on-- 2 years and did nothing but spent $210 million to send  troops to the border when he could have spent this money on a wall  if he wanted to when he had full control of the house.  He is sucking people in like you.
Jeremy Stephens From leftist communist is what he saved this country from.  Old elitist and idiot ghetto queens are the only democrat base...all communist
Jeremy Stephens I am Gods WITNESS and at the same time I posted this i was given a sign. I will pray for you Jeremy.
Jeremy Stephens I support the Presidents policies of standing against the slaughter of the unborn, traditional marriage as the Lord ordained it, protector and supporter of Israel ect.   I do not support his language or his behavior from time to time but I have no stones to throw because I‚Äôm not perfect either, ask me if I care what u think of me.
Jeremy Stephens I would guarantee every bit of your hate for him comes from liberal media outlets and their lies. Who has proven what wrong?? You don't want to debate because a brick could prove you to be a imbecile.
Jeremy Stephens North Korea, the country that made nuclear threats towards the USA. But obama never had the guts to start a dialogue with them. CNN never told you that.
Jeremy Stephens before bashing Fox can you post any stories that Fox had to correct and make a public apology? do you know of any Fox News Host that have been fired over #fakenews?  has Fox News ever been sued for #fakenews and lose as CNN has? " with court documents to prove it? "  case in point: https://www.scribd.com/document/339701870/Davide-Carbone-v-CNN  ( i'll wait )
Jeremy Stephens he promised y'all a wall and promised Mexico would pay for it. Explain that sir
Jeremy Stephens wow, talk about delusion. Ohr testified a lot of things, some of them back to mueller. It's getting very interesting. Do you realize just how many investigations are ongoing at this time into the abuse of fisa court and abuse of power? Guess not.
Jeremy Stephens wrong...he's letting the dimwit demolibtards know he's not going away and standing his ground for the best interest for the USA. TRUMP 2020!!
Jeremy Stephens you got nothin.
Jeri Hendren Guess you never went on strike on a company you work for. Like 92days!
Jeri Hendren yes lol they have about 10 better ideas than a wall. Read up.
Jessica Manoo . Women‚Äôs March tomorrow. Look up locations in the city

Jill Earnhardt Go and read Michael Cohen‚Äôs tweet, honey.
Jill Travassos  bump stock ban and his attorney general is against guns
Jill Travassos Call 1800 344 8082 press 1 to Demand THE Wall
Jill Travassos I‚Äôm just so frustrated people don‚Äôt see the logic in this.
Jill Travassos how many of her campaign staff have been arrested and convicted of dealing wiht Putin SNOWFLAKE?
Jim Cavo Gaff theres 33million undocumented illegals you and I support, and not by choice!
Jim See And What happened to that wall in Berlin?
Jim See Like I said read up on that! Because you are wrong! An estimated 5000 escaped into West Berlin! 327 were killed! Again,like I said do some reading on it & then get back to me instead of spouting ignorant nonsense!
Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Jim Villella they should feel LUCKY not to be Canadians! It's about SOVEREIGNTY You MORON!
Joan Bentivegna I think he may have needed as many as 10 votes since George Soros‚Äôs puppet John McCain was out almost the whole time
Joan Clapp Hillary by a landslide!
Joan Clapp What the heck kind a poll  are you looking at? CNN again?? He‚Äôs at 67% nice try   Ps That is the Quinnipiac poll
Joan Clapp crooked media, just look at the support he has in the comments. Keep believing cnn type poles taken by asshole dem sympathizers.
Joan Clapp=TDS patient
Joani Pakula , it scares me how many are not aware of that document, or do not take it seriously. They are well on schedule with the plan. Populous MUST wake up before it's too late!
Joani Pakula is not my problem that you love to wallow in the lies of Trump.  You believe a well known liar like Trump and then have the audacity to call someone else naive. Don't be a fool.  Read something outside of your comfort zone.
Joani Pakula you are a fool believing what Trump said.
Joani Pakula you should provide some data which demonstrates that there is a security crisis at our southern border. After you realize that the evidence doesn't support that crisis rhetoric,  you should think critically about the true nature of this demand for a wall (campaign gimmick) and the fact that there was bipartisan legislation passed by the Republican Congress that Trump refused to sign - after he said he would,  which shut down the government.    Is it rational to support and believe a well known liar?  Is it rational to blame Democrats for a shutdown that Trump promised if he didn't get what he wanted?
Joanne MacEachern trump should also be fined triple that. He started all of this
Joanne MacEachern, people CLAIM Donnie "doesn't get paid." Where's the proof when he's NEVER shown his tax returns? What's he hiding?
Job one !  And helping us in protecting our nation from  Rouge  Democrats  who swallowed the socialist rotten bait   hook line and sinker !  And  the damn bobber !
Jody Powell finally someone with a brain. Thank you for posting this
Jody Powell.  Haha. It is now Snowflake!
Jody Radtke Vie   Then why do we have so many illegals?
Jody Radtke Vie -WAKE UP...  Annual cost of illegal immigration: OVER $84 BILLION. Yet Democrats will NOT spend 5 BILLION to keep Americans safe & stop drugs. Wake up Taxpayers! #BuildTheWall üá∫üá∏
Jody Radtke Vie If you live in a border state you would see what is happening
Jody Radtke Vie Never have said we have never been safe. 4000 deaths due to illegals is not safe
Joe Nash 20 years from now he will be remembered as the worst and the first criminal President in the White House.
Joe Nash Glad to see you are in love with the traitor in chief...idiot
Joe Nash I read your recital.  The only problem with it is has no connection to reality whatsoever.  But your confident assertion of these prescribed lines precedes an inevitable resignation and probably some violence because people like you are confused.
Joe Saladino amazing commrnt
Joe Salvatore Carollo Demmocomunists seath with hatred for #TheBestPresidentInOurLifeTime I can't wait till #MAGA2020 becomes their new reality! Thank You Mr. President!

Joel Bernardini , demented demoncratic snowflake. At least he's still the man to all kinds of things your likes celebrate.
Joel Bernardini Funny that is your liberal reply ! Don't focus on need for a wall . Just sad .

Joel Bernardini u r a sad person to be wasting you time on here with this remark'- I suppose if your child had been killed from some one illegal - u would be more respectable.
Joel Bernardini why are you such a bully??? Daddy issues or mommy not love you, better yet lacking in the lower region?? It‚Äôs easy to be an asshole (as I‚Äôve just demonstrated).
Joel Bernardini yet he kept the umpa lumpa orange.  How Malania deals with that ... oh for the money.  The first hooker to become 1st ‚Äúlady‚Äù.
Joel Bernardini you are a worthless liberal.
Joel Bernardini, Look at your family picture. FFS.  I detect trolls.
Joel Bernardini, really? THAT is what you see? There are more important things to look at.
Joel Bernardini, who freaking cares! I could care less if he looked like Chris Christy or weighed 90 lbs. What I care about is agenda and that we have a stronger economy! So, please go ahead and attack MY cognitive dissonance! üôÑ

John Galicia i am praying for you
John Gardner Omg don't you Dems have other talking points. You definitely have RDS.  Boring as hell.
John Gardner stupid comment
John Hamrick Yet two things of note ... 1) illegals apprehended at the border are at the lowest point in nearly 40 years and 2) less than half of our illegals come across that border.
John Hancock who are you to say what God's plan is and where he/she is working with ppl lives..you yourself are just a man.your not made nor will you ever comprehend the plans of a creator when you are just a creation..that would be like you painting a picture and the picture understand why you created it ..or better yet an ant understanding your purpose when your working in your yard..
John Hancock you're completely fuckin stupid!
John Howard exactly President Trump should just push through the wall and sign an executive order that fines everyone who didn't support the wall, just like Obama fined everyone who didn't sign up for his  unaffordable Care act that he shoved down our throat after shutting down the government for 17 days.
John Mudri what lies?!
John Rigazio Frames.
John Ulsh yes and if I enter Canada illegally, am i breaking your Canadian laws or not ? Also , do you have any idea what it requires to immigrate legally to cabana ? FYI
John Westley Clark We the Deplorable solemnly swear to be loyal to our President, Citizens, Country, And Constitution!  Move to Venezuela, betrayer!
John Wild there is no strategy with Congress.  They have play with peoples lives for years.  Trump is one president who they can't make  a puppet out off. Now I ask you what is your solution to border security?
Jokes on you and your PM hoser.
Jon Chiusano you were dancing on rooftops in jersey on 9/11 weren‚Äôt you Juan?

Jonathan Schremp   Can you people find a little something more original to say than God Bless Donald Trump. That seems as though it‚Äôs about all you people have to say.  Find some reason why God shou
Jonathan Schremp  Speaking of defense-Trump‚Äôs choice of lawyers was bad. He would have been better off with Frito Pendejo.
Jonathan Schremp  do you think it‚Äôs strange that Trump didn‚Äôt get the wall funded over the last two years when the GOP controlled all 3 branches of the government? Now that he lost the House, now it‚Äôs a crisis. Don‚Äôt you think that is strange?

Jordan Ozzy DeLage, murder?? Talk about someone being triggered! You aren‚Äôt just a fool but a damn fool.   When you actually believe a president, former or current will ever see one second of jail, much less be executed, you really need to visit your proctologist so they can properly evaluate your level of brain damage.
Jordan Ozzy DeLage, overdosing on fool pills again?
Jordanian Border Wall BUILT USING $500 BILLION U.S. TAXPAYER MONEY BUT WE CAN'T HAVE OUR OWN WALL?  "GOP AND DEMOCRATS FULLY FUND A BORDER WALL -- IN JORDAN By Neil Munro, March 22, 2018  The 2018 omnibus provides just enough funds to build 33 miles of fencing on the Texas border ‚Äî but it also provides $500 million to help Jordan build a wall and defense line against jihad terrorists trying to cross its 287-mile border with Iraq and Syria. The omnibus budget says on page 394:  SEC. 9011. Up to $500,000,000 of funds appropriated by this Act for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency in ‚Äò‚ÄòOperation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide‚Äô‚Äô may be used to provide assistance to the Government of Jordan to support the armed forces of Jordan and to enhance security along its borders.  On page 375, the omnibus says:  For the ‚Äò‚ÄòCounter-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria Train and Equip Fund‚Äô‚Äô, $1,769,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2019 ‚Ä¶  That these funds may be used in such amounts as the Secretary of Defense may determine to enhance the border security of nations adjacent to conflict areas including Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Tunisia resulting from actions of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria:  The U.S.-funded, $500 million, 274-mile Jordan-Iraq border wall was described by Vice.com, in a 2016 article titled ‚ÄúThe Great Wall of Jordan: How the US Wants to Keep the Islamic State Out‚Äù;  The wall, which began as a $20 million project in 2008 to erect a set of surveillance towers along a 30-mile (50 km) stretch of the border with Syria, has since expanded into a program costing half a billion dollars, according to defense officials who spoke to VICE News. Called the Jordan Border Security Program or JBSP, the wall is ostensibly meant to stop weapons of mass destruction from getting out, but since 2013 has refocused on detecting Islamic State fighters and arms smuggling, as well as refugees, on both sides of the border ‚Ä¶  The first phase of the JBSP, the erection of the towers, was completed in September 2009. Phase 1B, the beginning of the fence, was completed in March 2014. Phases 2 and 3, the building of a fully integrated and networked fence running along a 275-mile(442 km) stretch of Jordan‚Äôs borders with Syria and Iraq and costing some $300 million, are scheduled to be fully operational this year. Further phases will extend the fence along the entire border and improve surveillance and detection gear. Mobile surveillance stations and quick reaction forces will be stationed at vulnerable points or emerging hot spots.  It‚Äôs all paid for by the United States taxpayer."  https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2018/03/22/gop-democrats-fully-fund-border-wall-jordanians/
Joseph Hart ... they all get paid, dumbass....
Joseph Hart You'll get paid every cent brother. That being said, if this shutdown prevents you from feeding your kids then you are a fucking loser. ...or were you just using a catchy phase to sound profound?
Joseph Hart first of all I  a disabled vet myself and have the utmost respect for any service member. Secondly, chill out buddy. You will get your pay. If you are in financial troubles after missing on paycheck then obviously you aren't very good with money and acting all badass calling me a keyboard commando sure doesn't make me shake in my boots.
Joseph Hart military is still funded you idiot
Joseph Mellone  Donny is sealing his fate as a one-term president!  Bwahahahahaha!!  Talk about obvious statements...EVERYONE agrees we need border security.  What we don‚Äôt need is his cost-ineffective wall.  Donny needs to agree to the bipartisan deal already passed by Congress so his shutdown does not completely destroy our economy.  Just give it up now and reopen our government!!!  Trump doubles down on border wall, as polls show voters turning against his shutdown strategy  https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doubles-down-on-border-wall-as-polls-show-voters-turning-against-his-shutdown-strategy
Joseph Mellone You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress.
Joseph Mellone right on
Joseph Mellone you do have a point uugghh
Joseph Mellone you must have a paycheck coming in.
Joseph Mellone you must like children a lot
Joseph Mellone your president needs you immediately Volunteer for the wall protect our borders give him your money Go go
Joseph goebbels would be proud
Josh Binder   thinking would be nice too
Josh Binder Trump won 37 states to 13. Trump won 304 to 224 electoral college votes. Currently 76% of Americans want the wall. #Trump2020
Josh Binder he's way smarter than you are.
Josh Binder you are free to move! Real patriotic Americans support President Trump and respect how he is restoring America from all the damage caused by obama
Josh Gr , no, that was Hillary, giving 20% of our Uranium to Russia. Don‚Äôt you have enough to do in Canada having to deal with Trudope ruining your beautiful country?
Josh Gr Are you seriously such a sad person that you are still blaming Russia for that L in 2016! What a loser haha
Josh Gr Ignorance
Josh Gr PROOF?
Josh Gr Russia is hoax perpetrated by the far left and fueled by the msm
Josh Gr Russia what.
Josh Gr Ummm ... like what about Russia??? Oh, you mean when HC sold Uranium to Russia?? Or maybe you mean when Russia was used in this admittedly fake dossier ?? üòÇ
Josh Gr no proof of collusion..... thank you, next!
Josh Gr why you worrying about the USA when you are not even a citizen,
Josh Gr worry about your own leader cupcake.
Josh Gr yeah we can talk about Russia 2.5 year long investigation with nothing to show for it aside from wasted money...but a wall is wasting money and republicans can‚Äôt do that. Only dumbass‚Äôs (Democrats) can waste America‚Äôs money.
Josh Lancer SAD!
Josh binder  You must want the  Secret service showing up at your front door to arrest your ass  You really should be careful about the words you use towards president trump
Joshua Snyder  Simple Trump wanted to make the DEMOCRATS the bad Guys.
Joshua Yang Lol they are. Look up on how and actually read it. They can't give us a check for it, we'll get it another way.
Joshua Yang Thanks To President Trump, the Asian workers have the highest job rating EVER!
Joshua de Perrodil and just what was that???
Joy Z Cohen  CNN is notorious for staging their broadcast! If this is true it‚Äôs truly sad that this person did not have even 60 days in savings for an emergency!
Joy Z Cohen  Childish snowflake
Joy Z Cohen -a federal employee without health insurance? Very odd!
Joy Z Cohen does that include your man?
Joy Z Cohen joy, but she will still pay for her I phone cable tv that‚Äôs more important. Complain to Nancy and chuck.
Joy Z Cohen so what you're saying is God won't forgive him for things that he allegedly did in his past, but anyone else that did something in the past will be forgiven??? That makes no sense to me.
Judy Feinberg Qualls The Senate passed a spending bill (with no money for the wall) 100-0 in December. The Republican house rejected it. Democrats took control of the House in January and passed that same bill. Now Mitch McConnell isn't even bringing it up for a vote (new session, new vote). This shutdown could end right now if Mitch McConnell wanted to. Trump isn't doing anything to help bring this shutdown to an end.
Judy Goebel , your right about hanging in there....the noose is tightening.
Judy Goebel Donny is sealing his fate as a one-term president!  Bwahahahahaha!!  Talk about obvious statements...EVERYONE agrees we need border security.

Judy Goebel goebbel
Judy Goebel we are counting on trump to be in prison soon!!! Then the round up of all you traitors will begin!
Judy Goebel you are thanking a man who stopped the pay and pay for 800,000 government employees and forces thousands of critical air traffic controllers to work unpaid. How do you sleep at night condoning such self centered evil?
Jul Cox https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/trump-says-theres-a-crisis-at-the-border-heres-what-the-data-says  Feel free to offer up your personal anecdote.
Jul Cox perfect so we can show Donald J. Trump the door anytime now...
Jul Cox there's no security crisis at the southern border. Read the preponderance of the information rather than believing a liar.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/trump-border-crisis-speech-not-fixed-by-wall-shutdown-2019-1
Jul Cox why?  You clearly ignore facts to support the man under investigation for talking and behaving like a Russian asset.
Jul Cox you don't know? Are you naive or indoctrinated. Do you think there's a national security crisis at our southern border like Trump said?
Julie Showers And you know this how? Keep screaming at the sky! üôÑ
Julie Smith  Lol who the hell cares? Happens all the time Never a crisis ever!
Julie Smith  Re: three caravans, I was not aware, nor do I consider them a threat.  Why should I?  You must be aware that we have the largest and most effective military in the history of the world?  What threat to you suppose these or any of the billions of other migrants might pose?
Julie Smith so what. It‚Äôs not illegal to apply for asylum.
Julie Smith yes but we need to warn them.
Just  do  an  executive order  and  stop  this  nonsense.    It  is  not  fair  to  the  people  who  depend  on  their  salaries  to  exist.    Stop  this  government  shutdown.
Just Bob no Bob he is not my President, he is a con man, corrupt, liar, unfit for the job.

Just exercise your right to exercise a national emergency.  Build the well needed wall and move on.! Stop the war between Pelosi and you!  Serve the American people!
Just give him the ok for the damn wall. So government employees can have pay
Just keep doing what you're doing President Trump!!
Just like Putin. We want this in Norway too. Unfortunately our Government is run by NWO FAKE POLITICIANS, WORKING FOR THEIR OWN FAME AND MONEY. Disgusting to witness norwegian msm as propagandists for these unworthy politicians selling our wealth out to sArabia and the NWO EU an UN.
Just like when you go to a hotel you stop at the front desk to get your Room no other country let you just walk in the door and make yourself at home why should we
Just remember France ! Damn Black Forest!
Just say no to open borders.
Just say whatever you think will get you votes!
Just took 2 years to get around said duty
Just wait
Justice has fallen in the streets and truth has turned away backward, pretty well describes where our congress has finally struggled and has reached.  From the Bible.
KEEP PRAYING TOGETHER  One Nation under God. Prayers, Praises & Faith. May God protect and guide our President! MAGA 2020

Karen Myrick You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress. Can you think of a reason he didn‚Äôt do it when he could?

Kathleen Scott I would have to agree with that.
Kathleen Scott agreed
Kathleen Scott our guy Dan Crenshaw is an example of the kind of congressman all of your states should want. He literally refused his pay check until other government workers get paid. That's integrity.
Kathleen Scott their salary from Congress is nothing compared to the money they get from their corrupt doing with lobbyists.
Kathleen Scott, Everyone, contact your representatives and email all of Congress to support ‚ÄúNo Government No Pay Act of 2019.‚Äù Bill , to stop congress from getting paid in a shutdown going forward. They are the ONLY ones that should not be getting paid!.
Kathleen Scott: Now you see just what has happened since we were reverted from a Republic (small less restrictive form of government) to a Democracy (large restrictive more expensive form of government that chisels away at or freedoms), which was not the original intentions of our Founding Forefathers.  Our Founding Forefathers gave us a republic and warned us, "If We Can Keep It".
Kathleen Towns Grimsley i have called my representatives offices about this and at first we have a great connection, but as soon as I mention term limits they can't hear me then hang up üò¢.
Kathleen Towns Grimsley sad but true, we really just need to scrap Congress and start over with TERM LIMITS
Kathryn Walker Emanuel you mean dividing the country and showing how little negotiating skills he really has. He couldn't even get his own party to agree to pay for his stupid useless wall!
Kathy A Norton Really???  It takes two parties to talk and actually make a deal to solve a problem.  I don't see the Dems doing much talking.  They were just partying it up in Puerto Rico, on a get away paid for by political lobbyist.
Kathy A Norton and how many of those lies have they publicly corrected or have been sued for?  " if they're real and really matter there would be court documents "  like we see for CNN and many other liberal media outlets like the one you're using as a source. üòÇ
Kathy A Norton did you forget hillary started that mess?
Kathy A Norton everything else you stated is complete political bs.   please link these stories if they're real?
Kathy A Norton i like real facts. PRO TIP: media headlines are not facts...
Kathy A Norton keep up with your fake headlines with zero proof... it worked out well in the last election. i'm sure Trump thanks you for his 2020 support. :)
Kathy A Norton thats difficult when one side dousnt want to do anything the other does hardly
Kathy A Norton why do you keep defecting and not posting the stories you say are out there? you keep trying to change the topic when called out to prove something. üòÇ
Kathy A Norton why have you not listed these stories yet? making bs up?  can you prove any lies? i have not seen one lie to turn out to be true in over two years of research. most people just try to use the complete BS on the NY Times like the " definitive list of Trump lies " that's labeled an opinion piece so they don't get sued for FAKENEWS like CNN did and LOST.    but i'd like to see what makes you think he is lying to his voters. his completed campaign promises to date kinda prove otherwise.
Kathy A Norton wrong, the Democratic party refuses to talk so Pelosi is causing the shutdown. Trump has been waiting in Washington DC while Pelosi went to Hawaii and the Democrats went to Puerto Rico to party.   Get you facts right before speak.  Democrats want to protect illegal immigrants over the security of the American people.  DEMOCRATIC SHUTDOWN..
Kathy A Norton yeah, let's take data from a biased anti-trump network that has been busted for lying many times.   love your logic and source of facts. they match up well. :)
Kathy Bezner why don't you pay up and build one and quit telling everyone that a wall is needed. The Trump had three years to fund the wall with a Republican dominated H.O.R and Senate and he didn't do anything. Now all of a sudden we Liberals and Democrats are being blamed for no wall? Let me remind you that he promised Mexico would pay for it and he couldn't force Mexico to pay up. So NO WALL!!! WHATSOEVER!!!
Kathy Finley Hayden do you know what it takes to immigrate legally to Canada ? My Lebanese family , applied and they had to pass a French test , a medical test , wait 10 whole years before their papers arrived then they only had one month timeline to land in Canada ... illegal immigration is not allowed in Canada or in any other country in the world ! Stop with the hypocrisy ! Why should illegal immigration be allowed in the states ? Love your country more than you love your party guys and stop finding excuses to illegal behavior ! Shame !!
Kathy Lee the platform was Mexico was going to pay for it and you sheep probably thought that was going to happen. Damn sheep everywhere
Kathy Solomon the land of the free hand out is over
Kathy Werbicki dumb ineffective wall to climb or fly over, swim or boat around, tunnel under, blast or cut through. Pure ignorance, from ignorant play president. He wants a government shutdown to golf more. Lazy crybaby babbling incoherent corrupt conman prick.
Kathy Werbicki, the man baby doesn't know what work is! In less than two years he has golfed and vacationed more than our last president did in 8 years! He has done so while profiting off of us tax paying Americans, by staying and playing as privately owned Resorts and golf courses. He is a con man. The Democrats have said every day for him to re-open the government! That there are other ways to secure our border other than an ineffective wall!

Keep fighting President!
Keep fighting for what we need, Mr. President. This could be our last real chance to get the wall that we need and start doing things right at our border, which is best for all. The folks missing pay now will eventually get paid. This goes beyond that for so many reasons, like our children‚Äôs future. Don‚Äôt give in. That‚Äôs what the Left is hoping you‚Äôll do, but you can‚Äôt. üí™üèºüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üôèüèª

Kevin Lake Again, its not a vacation. There are people being threatened with eviction, people who could have their services shut off, and people who can't get medication all because they don't have their money now. How is that so hard to understand? Again, if Trump thinks these people aren't essential why doesn't he just fire them and show us who he doesn't care about?
Kevin Lake If trump holds your values, Pleas feel free to ‚Äú love all over him‚Äù....Fo myself and  those I respect we will not as his values are not....
Kevin Lake Maybe some viagra would cure what ails your pathetic azz.
Kevin Lake Then why doesn't Trump just fire those redundant people? I'm sure we'd all like to know who he doesn't care about!

Kevin Lake how about you run your ignorant ass to my Coast Guard unit and tell my 42 member of an armed service that didn‚Äôt receive their paycheck to move along cupcake.... DM for the address and you better bring your big boy pants..cupcake...
Kevin Lake its not vacation for these people. There are real life consequences of Trump throwing a tantrum over his vanity wall. These workers aren't getting paid. Some people are being forced to work without getting paid. I would call that slavery.
Kevin Lake man you are in a roll, I can‚Äôt wait to see you tell that to my units face, and my families. Facebook commando, keyboard hero, bet you keep your mouth shut in real life #paythecoastguard #paydhs

Last 4 Presidents have wanted the same thing ..   so I'm not sure what the big deal is
Last I checked, Mexican border has remained the same since the 1850s, and we've seemed to get by. Illegal border crossings have steadily declined since the 1970s.  I'm trying to understand why now we have an "emergency", or "crisis"..  I thought healthcare was a crisis, that was going to be "so easy" to fix, and was going to be fixed on your first day, what happened??  Seems the great negotiator,  you're NOT!!!   You have said many, many times over the years, that a government shutdown is the president's fault, it shows their lack of ability to negotiate.   WELL?????
Last time I checked, we did not have open borders.  There are guys in booths checking ID's, agents with guns, bomb and drug sniffing dogs, lots of stuff!  Federal govt. employees not getting a pay check, please identify yourself.  The rest of you do not have a dog in this fight.
Last year more people died from gun violence committed by American citizens than all the murders committed by illegal aliens over the last decade.  True story.  There were nearly as many mass shootings committed by American citizens last year as there were days in the year.  True story.  If you want to clutch your pearls & cry over a genuine crisis, look no further than the next shooting.  No one thinks border security & illegal immigration are not important issues that need addressed.  True story.  Representatives from border districts from both nations, border patrol officials, military officials, citizens from both nations who live in the border region all agree that a wall is a bad idea for numerous reasons.  True story.  The wall is a 18th century idea that simply doesn‚Äôt work in a 21st century world.  More technology, personnel, & an end to ‚Äúthe war on drugs‚Äù policies are common sense & widely accepted solutions.  Additionally, have you wondered why this is happening now?  The GOP had control of congress & the white house for the past two years & did nothing about this ‚Äúcrisis.‚Äù  Why now?  Everything I‚Äôve stated in this post is verifiably accurate & I‚Äôll happily provide you w/ sources if you‚Äôd like.
Latest Trump Approval Poll Reveals: His Base (Cult) Is Turning on Him  On Thursday,the results of a recent NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist Poll were published showing that Trump‚Äôs approval rating is currently 39 to 53 percent. This means the president‚Äôs approval rating has gone down seven points from December when it was 42 to 49 percent.
Latest poll data: The president also faces some significant headwinds for re-election in 2020. Just 30 percent of registered voters said they will definitely vote for Trump in 2020, while 57 percent said they will definitely vote against him.
Latest polls show support for his wall is just shy of 35%. Half is a bit of an exageration.
Latonya Risinger most of the drug enter by mail and in vehicles at points of entry and must illegals just overstay their visas. A wall, which u already have, will do crab to d problem.  Use your brain!!!
Latoryaira Schnell Peoples Also, something like 80% of the girls taking the journey from Central America to the US are raped along the way. Who knows how many died along the way. I guess you don't really care about them either. I also figured, you don't care much about the angel families who has members killed by illegals, just and Nancy and Chuck who would even meet with them.  That's surely very compassionate and putting America First (not).
Latoryaira Schnell Peoples If you want to keep bury your head in the sand, sure. Here's just one study in Arizona:  "This data do not rely on self-reporting by criminals. Undocumented immigrants are at least 142% more likely to be convicted of a crime than other Arizonans. They also tend to commit more serious crimes and serve 10.5% longer sentences, more likely to be classified as dangerous, and 45% more likely to be gang members than U.S. citizens."  https://crimeresearch.org/2018/01/impact-illegal-aliens-crime-rates/
Laughable. Then you should have made it a priority when you had control of congress for 2 years. More LIES from the pathological liar!!! üëé
Laurette Reiff how many times did u edit you're dumb post.  girl please hypocrite

Laurette Reiff looney
Laurette Reiff you are such an angry idiot.
Laurie Dunco THIS...
Laurie Dunco They are taking care of the illegals with our Social Security money. Years ago in Obama's first years they even sent me a letter telling me not to worry how they would support the illegals as they were using Social Security money. It made me sick.
Laurie Dunco and the REPUBLICANS are spending like crazy
Laurie Dunco since you brought it up since trump refused to fund the ACA which actually benefits millions of Americans and works  and is cheaper than a wall that doesn't work, how can anyone claim this is for our safety. BTW illegal immigrants don't qualify for any social programs. Never have never will. That's some Jim Crowe era propaganda there.
Laurie Dunco so you just sit there looking (and sounding) stupid as you make stuff up?  Lol
Laurie Dunco, and that's because it doesn't benefit them.

Lee Grant   My moms dead and I‚Äôve been working and living on my own for a around 15 years now üôÇ
Lee Grant  And you're a fool, or a bot. Are you so stupid that you think the rest of the world isn't affected by your country's activities or your mentally retarded President? Get a life, idiot!
Lee Grant  Anne Crossway Anne dont you love the koolaid drinking trolls. Good old Lee here has a Facebook account joined in Dec 2018....ü§£ü§£ü§£ so much for Facebook monitoring their own site for fake profiles.
Lee Grant  if the Nancy thing was referring to something else I would love for you to say it....rather begging for you to say it because it would prove you are just as worthless as he is
Lee Grant  just another piece of eurotrash.
Lee Grant  you are obviously a trump cocksucker.... if you mean the current speaker no not a fan but I wouldn‚Äôt support trump because he could careless about you or me trust me I have seen his 20 plus years of destruction from AC to Fort Lauderdale so don‚Äôt come at me you little cocksucker..... I served my country unlike the draft dodger üñïüèª
Lee Grant or maybe I'm saddened and sickened by the fact that kids kill kids and noone seems to care, especially idiots like you
Lee Grant well bitch I replied so go f your self
Lee Grant whether he's right or not I still feel how I feel I still feel we should build the wall Democrats in anybody else that don't like it the live on the other f****** side of it not for nothing but I work my ass off to send my kid to college and now immigrants get to come here and go to college and s*** for free so let me ask the people something that don't want the Wall.. if us Americans went to their country do you think that they would honestly give us what we give them, food, housing, health Insurance, and now free college education! BULLSHIT!
Lee Grant your delusional. Obviously your getting a paycheck. Ask the 800,000 not getting paid about becoming unhinged.
Lee Grant...congratulations! You have just gone to the head of the Trumpkin Bumpkin Class of Stupidity and Delusion! When Humpty Drumpty is thrown out of office...of that there is NO DOUBT....there will be rejoicing in streets across the nation and you illiterate, brain dead Trumptards will be wailing into your China made MAGGAT hats!
Lee Mcclelland maybe you should get a job and put your moms basement
Legalize cannabis you can build that wall.
Leif Menzie I went to the food bank, I went to donate food for those that need it, instead of complaining on social media maybe you could do the same thing! PS in case you didn‚Äôt now trumps decision on the wall is now up to 63% approval rate you know that has to include Democrats
Leif Menzie lucky to live in America where there is help. Time to make sure we can keep it that way!
Lenny Anders  You know this how?  ü§•#45 whisper in your ear?
Leslie Battee Andre MILITARY IS BEING PAID! YOUR WELCOME! Did you ask Congress why they are getting paid? Nancy? Chuck? Nah....they were vacationing lol
Leslie Kirscht-Sutton Holker lol, I probably know more about your country's limited history to understand that Trump as Presidents go is nothing short of a joke..and I'm here because your comment was funny..the thing is you and the rest of the world are likely to need some prayer because he is an incompetent menace to not only Americans but to the rest of us..you do realise your country is the one believed to be the biggest threat to global peace. That said.. Clinton was shite too..for the so called, self given 'greatest' country on earth you lot are clueless. Go read some books and educate yourself.
Leslie Reyes I think they used too long of a needle when they injected her Botox... accidentally injected her brain.
Let him do his job! He is protecting all our interests!
Let me explain, Angel Moms are the mother's of children murdered by ILLEGALS. 100% of these children who were murdered by ILLEGALS Were murdered by ILLEGALS. And yes, more children are murdered by citizens than non citizens but that doesn't negate the fact that illegals are murdering children in the USA. If liberals really wanted to stop the no 1 cause of murder in this country they would help Americans overturn Roe V Wade.
Let me fix this for you: If we allow foreign assets to govern this country, then we cease to be a nation! #Resign
Let me get this straight... Nancy wants the president to delay the State of the Union speech ‚Äúbecause of security concerns‚Äù BUT she‚Äôs totally okay with NO security at the border! What a narcissistic bitch!
Let me know how that turns out for ya.
Let me put it into numbers you might be able to understand. Chump supporters equal about 1/3 of the voters 63,000,000 about 35% of those supporters want a wall about 22,000,000. All voters equal roughly 235,000,000. Now that means about 9.5% of the voters want a wall. No you dont have the people behind you.
Let the Border Security Workers decide how to spend the 5 billion. Then it wont be Trumps Wall-it will be the people on the front line deciding where it is best spent!
Let the Immigranfs pass, but must go straight to Canada, and collect two hundred to help them stay. No more wall just guidance and everlasting to.
Let the traitorous opposition further sink.  Speak to us citizens, that know that to stand is the only way forward, if our nation is to be saved.  God bless and guide our President, and America!
Let this man do his job,he is wonderful at it!
Let us be crystal clear about 1 thing. Trump's reasons for wanting a wall have nothing to do with border security. Trump only wants the wall for the same reason why he still believes The Central Park Five are still guilty years after being exonerated (look it up), he believes our first black POTUS is not an American citizen, & why he & his father refused to rent apartments to POC during their real estate days. He believes America is only great if it is the Whites-only, English-speaking only, Christian-only, etc. country that it supposedly was before a man of color had the audacity to run for & win the Presidency twice!!!!!!! He only wants the wall because he is a childish, immature, infantile, narcissistic, petty, spoiled, whiny, vindictive, man-baby, mob boss of a POTUS who believes that the entire world revolves around HIM & HIM ALONE because his rich daddy/parents always made everything work out in his favor with their connections, lawyers, & money rather than properly disciplining him & laying down the law that he will NOT look down on people who are different, he will NOT shut down anyone & everyone who says things which hurt his feelings, he will NOT threaten people & call them childish names & hurl childish insults at them until he gets your way, etc who only got Russia involved in the first place because, since he already had business interests in Russia, & since Putin is a dictator & Russia is a dictatorship, he knew that Putin was the only person & Russia was the only country that he looked at/sat in/test drove when he was shopping around for countries to assist him in getting his own way yet again by stealing the 2016 election who wouldn't automatically tell him to go f*** himself & stick his malignant narcissism where the sun don't shine (up his ass)!!! He is going to have to learn one way or another, & he WILL learn one way or another that the world does not revolve around him & him alone, & that he doesn't get to hold American workers & their paychecks hostage until people give into his little babyish/childish/immature/infantile temper tantrum & give him his wall like a spoiled child whose mommy won't buy him his favorite cereal at the grocery store!!!!!!
Let's build the wall then send Democrats to the other side to inspect it... and don't forget to call the Mexican federales.... then the democrats can learn first hand how immigration laws work..
Let's cease to be a nation!!! Make America MEXICO Again'
Let's defend our borders  Trump all the way I stand with Trumpü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
Let's do it
Let's see your husbands cheat on you,  then turn around and say "well you're not perfect either". Lol let's see how much sense that makes then
Lets build wall!!
Lets exterminate the cartel Mr President
Letting in illegals. Hammering the taxpayer with billions in Medicaid costs, court cost, prison costs, border policing is the Democrats Schumer and Pelosi (won't give $1 for the Wall) "solution" they been using for 40 years. The WALL is the solution. Once build it's a low cost low maintenance very efficient use of taxpayer money (but wait hold on that's the Democrats and Schumer/Pelosi main objection they can't get their hands on endless amounts of taxpayer money their non solutions have generated for decades) The Schumer's NYC there are 3 million illegals 35% of the 8.5 million population of NYC. If immigration Plan Schumer translates to the US it would mean 112 million illegals in US. White Europeans are now the minority in NYC and NY state had the largest number of it's citizens of all nationalities emigrating from it of any State in the Union meaning it has the poorest standard of living in the country. Schumer has risen to the top of the Democrat party not because of talent but because NY is a one party state since the 1920s and Calvin Coolidge. . The Democrats could run a dead rat for Senate and it would be elected in NY State-which would actually be an improvement since it would do less damage then Schumer. Things would actually improve without Crying Lying Chuck monkey wrenching the economy of the state-tax,tax,tax and let's add a Green something or other tax and more illegals to support
Letting the liberal socialists gain a foothold is also a threat to our nation.
Let‚Äôs defend our country from this clown.   Traitor
Let‚Äôs have an isis birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi the Muslim lover
Let‚Äôs hope he takes the SOTU to a friendlier venue and fills it with real patriots
Levi Col√≥n illeagal Mexicans should contribute 0% percent of the total crime in this Country. They should recieve 0% of this Countries budget.

As the new Federal Dipshid once said..."GET IN THEIR FACES!", CALL them NON-STOP!, HARASS THEM EVERYWHERE YOU SEE THEM!

Liberals want more power but America isn't big enough. They're hoping for world domination so dissolving America is their first step. Of course the borders and the constitution have to go.

Linda L Hopkins having a president that really is doing what he campaigned on is a mistake?   289 accomplishments in just 20 months for his voters, he must be a TRADER...  with a statement like yours, I'm willing to bet money, you couldn't name two of his completed campaign promises...

Linda Vera You've already said good bye to your freedom. You voted for Trump who is selling America off to Russia. You've already lost your freedom because you have to arm yourself against your fellow Americans and bolt yourself up in your house because you're guarding your 'stuff'. You've already lost your freedom because you live in gated communities and can't walk alone at night. America is not free and not brave. If you were, you would get that nutcase out of your White House and put in an adult.
Lisa Golden I think it‚Äôs not a bad idea for sure. For the life of me I just don‚Äôt know why he didn‚Äôt get this in the works when he had all three branches of government.
Lisa Golden You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress. Can you think of a reason he didn‚Äôt do it when he could?
Lisa Helvey Poole that will require one hell of a lot of prayers
Lisa Hertel I‚Äôm American though. And Casey is right. Trump posts this multiple times a day.

Listen up. It is written The wall is necessary to secure our borders and protect the Nation of United States of America and its population.  Sir, excellent decision. Lets finish the wall necessary to secure our borders and protect the Nation of United States of America and its population.  Israel re-built there wall in 52 days during the Bible OLD Testament time with no modern tools as we have today in the 21st Century.  Nehemiah 6:15-16 New Living Translation  The Builders Complete the Wall  15 So on October 2d the wall was finished‚Äîjust fifty-two days after we had begun. 16 When our enemies and the surrounding nations heard about it, they were frightened and humiliated. They realized this work had been done with the help of our God.  Definition of enemy plural enemies 1 : one that is antagonistic to another; especially : one seeking to injure, overthrow, or confound an opponent 2 : something harmful or deadly alcohol was his greatest enemy 3 a : a military adversary b : a hostile unit or force  http://biblehub.com/nlt/nehemiah/6.htmbiblehub.com

Luis Arboleda what a damn SHEEPLE. Believing all the DemonCrats lies. Say good bye to YOUR freedom and anything you own if you IDIOTS continue to vote Dem.  You'll be living......or NOT living like the people in Venezuela. It amazes me you Dems are THAT DAMN STUPID!!
Luke Wade, killing and beheading teachers?  In Mexico?  Are you sure you aren‚Äôt confusing Mexico with Afghanistan?  Even if it was actually Mexico that you speak of, its a Mexican problem.  Not ours.    I don‚Äôt care if 333,000 people are ‚Äúrushing‚Äù to change citizenship when Canadians are the greater share of illegal immigrants.    I‚Äôve also never met a lazy Mexican.  On top of the fact that I thought they were ‚Äústealing our jobs‚Äù,  or was that a lie?  You can‚Äôt have it both ways.  They cannot both be stealing our jobs and simultaneously refusing to work.  They do jobs that you or I would only do as a last-ditch effort to stave if homelessness at best.    They also DO pay taxes!  Just not federal income taxes.  They pay sales taxes on everything they buy.  Where‚Äôs the outrage over major employers choosing to knowingly employ these people anyway?  There is a creation of an attractive nuisanice in ignoring that kind of illegal employment.  But, again, why waste that kind of money on a wall that won‚Äôt stop drugs or gangs?  Especially when we are facing a record budget deficit.
Lying about immigration and shutting down the government is the same as defending national borders?  Only on Fox and Friends.
Lying ass !
Lying scumbag, whipping your dullard followers into a froth-mouthed frenzy over a mere administrative issue. You're a damned disgrace.
Lynda Birch Jeffs  The majority does NOT want the wall. You are wrong "Sweety".
Lynda Birch Jeffs So when border patrol says we need a wall, then that's the majority? Please give me a break and who told you that I am NOT from "here"?
Lynda Worden  I politely disagree that we need the wall.  For what?  I wonder.
Lynda Worden we need President Trump too!!!!

Malignant liar.
Man you fake trolls are out there in full force but you are not the voice of the people, you are scum cowards hiding behind phony accounts! How‚Äôs the weather in Russia or is it China or in your Mom‚Äôs basement? Build the wall! BTW, your irreverent comments just unifies us even more and makes us stronger so knock yourselves out!

Maria Gambrelli it's called adaptation, glad you have a sense of humor gonna need it when the Truth is revealed. Rudy will probably screw up again and admit Trump and Family knew everything!
Maria Lopez Not even one of your friends say ,you are smart
Maria Lopez we care, just come here under due process and Support America. We really don't care where a person comes from, however we do care that they come here to join America not to change it suit their ways.
Maria Shafer secret service should visit you!!!
Marie Foster thank you
Mario Salerno Obama created policy that protected Americans from 5 most dangerous countries. Trump opened the boarder to them. Obama created policy to modernize the wall. Trump caged babies. Never forget 9-11 16 terrorists were Saudi. They were Saudi trained. They were Saudi financed. ZERO were Mexican. Zero arrived from Mexico. Zero would have been stopped by a idiotic wall! This man tRump and his son-in-law just sold $billion weapons to the only people, the Saudis, who've attacked America. Trump and GOP just allowed the Saudi Prince to murder and dismember Khashoggi. Makes you think.
Mario Salerno definitely saving it from the Democrats trying to destroy it
Mario Salerno he‚Äôs destroying this country! Trumpets are such idiots
Mario Salerno saving how?
Mario Salerno yeah, Russia!
Mark Butler aw are you trying to spam me with all the :) and >:( come on.
Mark Butler have fun looking at my page and just don't forget 6 MORE YEARS Trump 2020!
Mark Butler:  I know but, it sure would make them wise up and do the right thing for the American people as a whole and think of our country rather than their own self interests of just not letting Trump win because they despise him so much.  Over 327 million human lives versus 1 that is hated.  Odds should be in the majority's favor. wouldn't your think?ü§î
Mark Hack  https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/tv/fox/ Here you go. And a bunch of other half truths and lies!
Mark Hack And those "conversations" he had with the OTHER lunatic were just a photo-op, a handshake to appease his ego... Coz in reality he was PLAYED, BIGLY! https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/north-korea-secret-missile-site-upgrades-satellite-images
Mark Hack Apart from THAT, it's common knowledge Hannity and Orange have a night call where they make up their daily "news" for you to gobble up... BTW they're BOTH  under several investigations... https://www.thedailybeast.com/report-trump-and-hannity-have-a-bedtime-phone-call-most-nights
Mark Hack But what are you saying, that there AREN'T 17 investigations into Orange? Coz i tell you, there really ARE... https://www.wired.com/story/mueller-investigation-trump-russia-complete-guide/
Mark Hack YES, Fox was sued for constantly spreading lies, back in 2004. Fox won because it was registered as ENTERTAINMENT so they could say whatever they wanted to without being liable. YES, you are watching an ENTERTAINMENT channel... https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/1/14/1620475/-Fox-News-Is-NOT-News-Network-s-Own-Ads-Label-Its-Programming-As-Entertainment
Mark Hack anything not spoken by trump or conservative Talking Heads is a lie according to trump brainwashed cult followers!
Mark Hack did he bring HIS and his families businesses to the USA?  NO, they are still in China and other Asian countries!  But don't worry NONE of them are on the Tariffs list! Did Mexico agree to pay for the Wall?  Did Hillary go to jail? Did he sue those women who said he sexually assaulted them?  But trump followers don't care! They think they're making more money  , and money is all they care about!
Mark Hack https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/5340060/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-summit-russia-meddling
Mark Hack so you STILL believe the pathological liar in the WH??
Mark Hack what lie? The over 7,000 verifiable lies that Trump has told?
Mark Hack you're correct, FOX ENTERTAINMENT news has never retracted the "Pizzagate" story or "that Obama wasn't born in the USA" or "that Obama was coming for your guns" or "FEMA camps"! FOX is NOT a NEWS program the CEO of FOX said "they are an ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAM!"
Mark Hack you're joking right?  He put sanctions on Russia, closed two diplomatic compounds and also expelled many Russian diplomats.  Trump? He believes Putin over our intelligence agencies, removed some sanctions and also has taken his time putting on Congressional sanctions.
Mark Parsons - what about them Mark?  ICE reports most illegal drugs are being smuggled at ports or through tunnels under the walls in towns.  The Chinese are becoming a problem as well with their smuggling at sea ports mostly with  fentanyl.
Mark Parsons typical Trump supporter response. Conspiracy theories and name calling. By the way none of those terrorist crossed over the southern border. Planes fly over walls
Mark Parsons yeah right. I guess that's why your boy Manafort is getting ass raped in prison right now.  Military traitor Flynn is singing to Mueller at a very high decibel level to avoid giving up the booty.  Jared and Don the Con, Jr are next, then the retarded kid.  Keep denying.  Anyone that supports this crook is also a traitor.
Mark Warren How about talking to the Border Patrol, they are saying they need the wall!!!!
Mark Warren talk to the Border Patrol, their saying they really need the wall!! Their there every day not us or politicians!!!!
Mark said after 30 days of shut down they can cut some stuff interesting times
Mark van Beek , why do wealthy politicans and movie stars have walls and gates surrounding their homes.
Mark van Beek Just Trump imitating one of his Russian heroes.
Marley Dee  you keep telling yourself that! Trump is the best President Ever! Build that wall and secure our country! Vote Trump 2020! Do you realize Nancy is what‚Äôs wrong with our country! She wanted the wall once until Trump promised the people the wall! Now she doesn‚Äôt because she doesn‚Äôt want Trump to make good on this promise to build the Wall! Problem solved if Nancy was dismissed! She‚Äôs going to far! Government could open if she cared about the people! Hey Nancy open your doors and fence your friends are coming!

Martha Pickens  Yes, he couldn‚Äôt get enough votes to get this ridiculous piece of egoism passed when the republicans held both houses. What in the world makes him think it will happen now?
Martha Pickens FAILURE AND THIEF !
Martha Pickens I am. It's 100% more believable than a verified pathological liar.
Martha Pickens here we go again. Just have to mention Clinton and Obama. Nothing better to come up with I guess! The defense of our nation should not be dependent on a lying, draft dodging con man. He would not know how to defend our nation nor does he have the mental capacity or intelligence to learn. You can‚Äòt say that about Clinton or Obama. Funny how we are always less safe when it is a Republican President with the scare mongering! Last time I checked 9/11 happened under a Republican. Oh and Clinton and Obama were not in bed with the Russians!
Martha Pickens then not now.
Mary Dios T Ama   Our government is SECULAR nor a theocracy.  This, deciding policy in the name of God is not allowed.  These are the same rules that ensure you will always be able to  worship as you please.  God did not elect Trump...unless you feel he also elected Obama.
Mary Lewis me too, he's a real leader and loves our country!

Maybe ??? Give a LARGE Portion of the US Military Budget to US Law Enforcement AND have them Create a More Secure & Safer  North America, Central America & South Americaüåé
Maybe fund the TSA so every boarder is better protected?
Maybe the Democrats should pull their head out of their ass!
Maybe trump should start fining people who don't want the wall, like obama did with Obamacare. Funding would be available fast...
Maybe you are on drugs ,then make sense your comment.
Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Maybe you could end this childish shutdown so the people who defend us can get paid?
Maybe you should build a army base at the border & patrol from there ( guess the Congress would be opposed to that also)
Maybe you should just invade central and South America then, you pathological lying fraud.
Maybe you should talk about trump and his orange hair, his fake tan and his lack of intelligence !
Me I Will vote For Trump in 2020
Me me me!!
Me to √≠ voted for DONALD TRUMP as Hispanic woman I love you My president
Meanwhile, hardworking Americans are starving while their life savings are dwindling down to nothing, all over petty political stubbornness on both sides of the aisle. There's nothing to celebrate here.
Meanwhile, the airports are more compromised.  From the "stable genius."

Michelle Helderman  I absolutely love this! And if you read in revelations, when the world goes as  one nation the anti christ will rule it. We are given a choice to stop it!
Michelle Helderman If that scripture were referring to a person then trump would have a capital T. You are just grasping at straws. Also, God would never condone the actions of this man. The fact you think he would makes you a fake.
Michelle Helderman You are a nobody, same as I am. You witnessed nothing. You saw a little thing in your book and latched onto it with all you have, with the hopes it would explain to your practical mind, why your spiritual mind thought voting for this highly immoral person was the best choice for America. I don't mind being prayed for, as I will pray for you as well.
Michelle Helderman and if you use the Bible, remember it says not to commit adultery like trump, don‚Äôt steal like trump, be a righteous man unlike trump, love thy neighbors unlike trump, be humble, help the sick, help the poor, etc etc.
Michelle Helderman he is coming soon for those who are looking for his appearing
Michelle Helderman stop letting your  faith lead you so blindly, use you head not a bible
Might wana check Pelosi for a UTI..she talking crazy.
Might want to stop the government shutdown then, so we can have the needed employees in the Airport, where the real threats come from.
Mik Dundee my wife worked at a hospital and didnt receive a raise for 5 long years because of illegal immigrants not paying their bills. That's how.

Mike Kizy id rather have a tax cut for whomever makes under 100k
Mike Lee Limmer how many test have NK done since 2016?
Mike Maynard That is not true at all. No Democrat ever has called for open borders. Republicans just like to say that's what Democrats want. But no Democrat has ever said that. If you do not have a social security number you can't vote in the US. So no illegals can vote for Democrats or Republicans. Democrats win more often then Republicans, because they show human compassion more often then Republicans. The vast majority of the people in this country want that from their leaders more then the strong arm approach. You don't have to agree with me on the surface. But just think critically as to why the last three Republican presidents only won the electoral college and not the popular vote, while the last 3 Democratic presidents won the electoral college and the popular vote.
Mike Maynard ask the local businesses who hire if they care...lol...they don't and won't unless you string a few up every day until they respect you...lol...that's NOT going to happen... Businessmen are toooo greedy...plus you are subsidizing their workers very nicely...and they have lowered their taxes so you pay even more...you're the fool for thinking gov isn't helping business...

Mr President  , tell sneaker Pelosi  (yes sneaker) to take a long walk off a short pier and you intend to expose the liberal agenda for what it's worth in the State of the Union.
Mr President God Bless you.
Mr President I agree with you however there are people working without pay meanwhile Congress an Senator's are still being paid so who are you out to punish the American people who voted for you I hope that isn't your intention we love the work you are doing just please don't punish us.
Mr President PLEASE use this and spit in the Demonrats faces and have the State of the Union anyways!!!  https://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A2Sec3.html
Mr President please build that WALL.
Mr President please have the SOTU address where every don,t let her get away with anything, the American people want to hear you. Good bless your North American Indian Brother.
Mr President the outcome of this government shutdown will be more harmful to ur governance and might make new history in America for the President being removed from the office
Mr President we know you are  fighting demons just know God the Father is the One with Power. Let them bring it on!  ü§ò
Mr President why did you lie when you said the 2nd A mendment would be safe with you as long as you were President .You think the 5th amendment [due process should not be held up] Red flag laws violate the 2nd and 5th amendments, now I am sorry I voted for you.
Mr President you have my support one hundred percent. As the great grand daughter of immigrants who came here the right way.....by right way I mean they didn't sneak or try to push their way in....I say kudos for taking on this fight and not simply whimping out and passing it on to the next administration .
Mr Trump the correct Nazi salute is with the palm flat. a wall to defend the US is a wall on the northern border next?
Mr Trump....Tell it to Mrs.Merkel
Mr president  Human trafficking is going on right new in Iowa and Illinois. And the police are apart of it. There churches in America are supporting them through organizations that help relocate women and children. What there doing. The cities that have large churches. that give a lot to missions. Is how the raise money. Then they ship the illegal immigrants to another city. Where the coyotes cartel are waiting for them. I saw it at the church I was going to.  And yesterday I over heard a police officer talking about. A case of a woman stabbing a man. Both here illegally. The officer said that the federal government told him to go to the Catholic Church in town to get there name. I told them that this is called human trafficking. They looked at me like I was crazy
Mr president Trump the great üëç
Mr president üëç
Mr trump all due respect ‚úä perhaps you can stop the nation from paying taxes until this boarder is resolved
Mr trump just stop being childish and build that fuckin wall with your moneyüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Mr trumpo  we are all nations in America..   that is how we become  Americans.   Yes we need security.  From corruption.
Mr.  President Donald J. Trump please take note. Dale Jelinek said and I agree 100%.    "Trump/Sarah Sanders should have a sign always at hand that reads something like:  "For the xxth day in a row, the White House invited Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to a working lunch today to discuss the border security and government shutdown. They once again refused to attend. The invitation was extended to lunch tomorrow as well." The daily press briefing should start and end with that message. Mr. President Donald J. Trump  should say it whenever a microphone is shoved in his face.  For myself Mr. President Donald J. Trump, I stand behind you 100%. The Union should be standing behind their workers with a fund for strikes shutdowns etc.  It's not like this issue isn't threatened 2x a year every year for the last 22 years.  If they don't have catastrophic events coverage for their members they are not protecting their members in the spirit of what a union is supposed to be for.
Mr. D. YOU Rock!
Mr. PRESIDENT,  You are not alone, You do what GOD sent you to do, and "WE THE PEOPLE" are 100% with you since day 1,   we will obey what God sent us to do in his word ( 1 Timothy 2:1-2) to pray at all the time for those in power , you, and your administration, and all those in authority, pray   for wisdom, protection and strength. You will overcome in the name of Jesus, if we understand what 2 Chronicles 7:14 says " if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."  WE THE PEOPLE WILL SEE THE HAND OF GOD, how will destroy all this barriers ( " enemies") that are in the way in the name of Jesus . Amen üôè God bless you  and God blessüá∫üá∏ America üá∫üá∏‚ù§üá∫üá∏
Mr. President Donald j Trump . Why can‚Äôt you‚Äôll meet in the Middle an make a decision about the Boarder Wall or Walls Security. An open back up the GOVERNMENT PLEASE.....ENOUGH IS ENOUGH...
Mr. President I am with you all the way. Executive order It's time!
Mr. President I thank GOD you are the Commander
Mr. President as soon as that next caravan hits the US Mexican border declare a national emergency!
Mr. President how the House and Senate vote overwhelmingly for $716 Billion military budget to finance any future unwinnable wars, and when it comes to a very national security small budget, it was denied?
Mr. President i am from Philippines but I salute you for what you are doing.
Mr. President in addition to the wall being built please cut the Federal budget by the 400,000 non-essential employees that are not working now!
Mr. President thank you for all your are doing for our country. I have a solution how to pay for the wall don‚Äôt fight Pelosi all you have to do Tax the money sent to Mexico .
Mr. President you can do anything.
Mr. President,  Sir,  You Perfectly Perform  your Duties to AMERICA Above & Beyond the Call of Duty. You are a Righteous Commander & Chief.  GOD Bless you,  Sir.
Mr. President, I 100% support your position about the wall--it is needed especially with another caravan headed our way. As a forever Trumper, I would suggest calling their bluff in front of God and the entire country. Here is my suggestion on a dialogue for the SOTU message----You should reopen the government DURING THE SOTU MESSAGE,.You should say that "I have always stood for doing what is best for the American people, for their prosperity and their security and because of that promise to the American people and because I want to show my willingness to negotiate and work with the Democrats... They have said that we should we reopen the government AND THEN we can talk so I am holding them to their word. I will give instructions to reopen our government immediately and I want to say thank you to all the people who have hung in there with us. I will also instruct that all people effected by the shutdown receive their back pay immediately. BUT, tomorrow, I will request a bi-partisan meeting to keep the commitment of the left to enter into honest and open negotiations about the wall. If we cannot then reach a mutual agreement to fund the wall/barrier, I will have no choice but to take an alternate measure of action. Hopefully, with another caravan heading to our border, all parties will realize the need for this border wall which has worked in places we already have a wall as well as how it has worked in other countries. I will do my part and I hope they will do theirs". I think it is a win for you showing your concern for those impacted by the shutdown and now they would have to put up or shut up. God Bless you Mr. President---I will be 100% with you in 2020.
Mr. President, I know you were hoping that the Democrats would quit with their childish antics and start working for the people again that they were supposed to be representing in the first place; Sadly I don't see it happening. Just declare the emergency and get it built... They're not going to come around because they're losing nothing with the shutdown, they're just letting the people of this country suffer so they can blame it on you.
Mr. President, please consider the Senate Chamber to deliver the awesome SOTU address to the nation. It's high-time to bring Pelosi and Schumer to their collective soulless knees and force them to submit to wall funding.  You Are the Maga-Man!
Mr. President, stand your ground in order to protect our country. Americans are with you.  God bless the USA
Mr. President, the protection of our beloved nation ALSO comes through an honorable, Constitutional DOJ. Your nominee HAS TESTIFIED THAT HE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE 2ND AMENDMENT!   WE CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER BAD DOJ! Your time in office is too short and precious!   PLEASE PULL THIS NOMINATION AND GIVE US A STRONG CONSTITUTIONAL DOJ WHO WILL ASSIGN ANOTHER SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE THE TRUE CORRUPTION OF THE CLINTONS, AND OBAMA, THE FBI AND THE DOJ AND STATE DEPT AND HUD!  WE NEED CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF ALL OF THESE TREASONOUS CRIMINALS!  AND PLEASE DESTROY THE ILLEGAL DATABASE THAT OBAMA HAS ON US ALL!
Mr. President, your pick for Attorney General said he is for these unconstitutional red flag laws. Nobody should have a right to search your house and confiscate your guns without due process. What I mean by that is facing your accuser in court in front of a judge. Anybody that wants to get you in trouble or is just afraid of guns can make up anything. One of my neighbors saw me putting my shotgun in a case in my trunk and approached me and said she doesn‚Äôt feel safe because I have guns at my house. If we had red flag laws then I‚Äôm convinced she would have called the police and reported me. My gun collection is an investment for me. So if someone falsely accuses me my collection would worth a lot less when I get them back because you know the police aren‚Äôt going to take care not to damage them and if you read some of these laws they aren‚Äôt responsible for any damage. You promised before the election that ‚Äúthe attack on your 2nd amendment rights is over‚Äù. So far you‚Äôve have been worse than Obama in his 8 years in office.  These laws put law enforcement at unneeded risk. I know I won‚Äôt let them in my house and I‚Äôve always supported them. We already had one death in Maryland because of this law and I don‚Äôt think it will be the last. I was appalled that the democrats made Brett Cavanaugh prove his innocence and this law is doing the same thing to gun owners. I thought in this country that you were innocent until proven guilty not the other way around. The gun owners put you in office on your promises to have our backs and you would fight these anti-gun laws that do nothing other than infringing on the legal gun owners in this country. I don‚Äôt see any politician suggest we go after all of the gang violence where most of the shootings occur. The other thing is if you look into a lot of these shootings the person had weapon charges against him or her but they seem to always plea-bargain down to a lesser offense because the prosecutors feel this aren‚Äôt that important. I hope you take this to heart because you need us to win in 2020. Thank you and take care.
Mr.Donald Trump A Representative Of Democracy & Missing Pieces 2020 You Have My Support

My SON AND HIS HUSBAND voted for Trump!  Don't believe the democrats' lies!
My amazing man . . . xo
My family and I are standing behind you. God always has your back!!!! No weapon formed against you shall prosper. All the. evil talk coming against you and all the hatred can't stand up against God!!! God Bless you!!!! Heavenly Father please soften the hearts of the ones prolonging building the wall. I pray they realize the importance of our safety for our country and come in agreement with President Trump to build the wall. In Jesus name Amen.
My highest duty is to take care of ME then maby thee country if I feel like it maby
My husband is retired government, our daughter and a son in law, work for the government. Daughter is on leave, son in law is still working and being paid. Yes it is hurting some now, but everyone must pull together help those waiting for a pay check.  Stand firm we must protect our borders. We are behind the president 100%  Keep the borders closed until the money is allocated.  A guestion, what happened to the 50 billon that was supposed to be set aside in 2006 under the Bush administration, that Obama was supposed to use to build the wall?   Palosi, Hillary and Shumer signed it. They are hypocrites. I honestly wish that the Democrats could get a wake up from God. Even God in the Bible sanction walls.
My kids father was murdered by an illegal immigrant right here in the US. Build the Wall Mr. President! I still want to remain in this nation called the United States of America! No open borders!
My people were a nation... We were also freedom, for your kind... You stole that freedom and called it your own. we need a person from that nation to lead us if we want true greatness again... You are not it
My president
NATO HAS DEFENDED OUR BOARDERS FOR SEVENTY YEARS MOTHERFUCKER TRUMP!
NEED TO BUILD THAT WALL ON THE CA.-AZ.  BORDER, CA IS GOING TO BE A FORIEGN ENTITY VERY SOON...!!!
NEVER GIVE UP!
NO WALL EVER!!!!!!!
NO WALL NO JOBS BUILD THE WALL KEEP THE JOBS ..DEMOCRATES JUS WANNA GET HIGH AND SELL DRUGS...VULTURES
NO you swore to defend and uphold the constitution. THAT is your most important duty.  SMH!
NO, Sir!  Your highest priority is to hoodwink the American people, and pretend to be a human being . BUT, we are not as deceived as you think!  Look up, your judgment is coming and it will be very dire!
NO, it is not, Mr. man-child Trump!  Your highest and most important "duty" is deflecting attention to the growing evidence against your corrupt & colluding ways, and your abominable attempts at dividing our nation.  You, sir, are nothing more than a pathological lying deluded man-child.
NOT DEFENDING OUR BORDERS, IS THE SAME AS NEVER HAVING ANY POLICE DEPARTMENTS ON EARTH EVER AGAIN, SO YOU ALL COULD SUFFER DUE TO DEMOCROOKS NOT ALLOWING US TO HAVE THE WALLS!
NOW -----NO OPEN WITHOUT.......
NOW THIS:  BREAKING: Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, says he paid a tech firm to rig online polls before the 2016 presidential campaign got underway "at the direction of and the sole benefit of" Donald Trump.  FRAUD PRESIDENT ALERT!!!!

Nadine Weber no threat there just people travelling to and from work. I spent the last three years traveling around that area for work when I lived in Merced California.
Nadine Weber, do YOU live at the border that you can honestly say "how bad it is"? Seriously! You live in NEBRASKA!!   You people are caught up in hysteria for something that doesn't even AFFECT you. This "border crisis" was created by the man in the White House to deflect from the fact he has RUSSIAN CONNECTIONS!

Nancy Pelosi doesn't care. Keep the Shutdown in force Build the wall
Nancy Pelosi wants to thank you for voting democrat in the last election. She and 30 of her democrat coworkers along with 100+ lobbyists were having a lovely time in Puerto Rican enjoying that balmy weather, attending the play Hamilton and partying with the cast in the evening, while regular Americans are struggling to make ends meet since giving 0.005% of the $3.8 trillion annual budget for the wall is just to expensive!
Nancy Pelosi was planning to visit her real bosses: the EU cabal HQ, the Muslim Brotherhood HQ, and the opium production HQ. THIS WOMAN NEEDS TO BE OUT OF OFFICE, SHE'S WORTH 200 MILLION BECAUSE SHE'S A TRAITOR
Nancy Pelosi, as well as many other democrats have what the Bible calls a "reprobate mind," Calling good things evil and evil things good.
Nancy Pelosi, talking about someone told her about how she couldn‚Äôt buy her insulin because of the shut down, I‚Äôm thinking, well my god Nancy, why don‚Äôt you do something about it, come to an agreement instead of going to Hawaii vacationing. She don‚Äôt give a damn either about this persons insulin or her health. POLITICS.
Nancy Pelosi.
Nancy Pelosis phone # is 202-225-4965 call her and voice your concerns. I just did. I asked her if she would take a drug test....the phone went silent and then started beeping all weird. It's sad the way they treat you President Trump. Schumer could never do a deal like you and he knows it. Looked like a trouble teenager in the principals office the other day with you. Democrats cant get rich on their own like you did. They need to steal and lie to get anywhere. Schumer's a rat that needs to go to the nursing home or find a trap. His number is 202-224-7433 but he's too much of a coward to answer.
Nancy got TRUMPED! STAY THERE AND DO YOUR JOB!
Nancy has a wall around her house!  We can blame the Democrat politicians for the shut down!!!   President Trump 2020!
Nancy is going for a Coup de ta
Nancy is on the Tarmac could you send her an Uber?
Nancy pelosi wants president Trump to postpone the state of the union because she wants security for herselfwell what about America security Nancy call her out on this president Trump we need more people to go to the capital or to real news and tell their stories
Nancy wants protection for her. Trump wants protection for the whole country!
Nanzi pelosi wants to stretch the existing border fence to make it appear younger. A fence lift.
Nasty Nan doesn't want to fund the wall and now she is taking the word of 1 unknown person to tell the President to not give his SOTU address.  Both she would then use to claim he was weak and incapable to try to take the spotlight off of her for being weak and incapable.  She is a snake and her actions are why she has no business in office in Washington.  She is inept and incapable of doing anything but trying to cause trouble.  This country cannot function well on that agenda--as proven!
Natalie Halem pay attention mam... The Democrats are not going to give OUR PRESIDENT ANY SUPPORT ...THAT'S RIGHT HE IS YOUR PRESIDENT TOO!!!
Natalie Halem yea Nancy and the Democrats won‚Äôt open the government. 5.7 billion is a drop in the bucket for them! They rather give it to Central American dictators than use it at home.
Natalie Halem, is that all you've got?!  Nice try libturd.
Natalie Halem. 5.7 billion please!!
Natasha Bitter Russia
Nathan Teal you are mistaken, Trump doesn't love anything but himself and money! He hasn't been trying to open the government, he is playing politics for his vanity wall. He owns the shutdown, he said so himself.
National Emergency do it and stop talking about it..they will not budge so do what has to be done Mr. President.
National Republican Congressional Committee tell Rep.Pelosi to get out of the way because we know there are enough Representatives to vote the money for the wall.
National Vote. Lets get it over with already. There is no way 535 Ivy League people can't come to an agreement yet both Republican and Democrat civilians can agree on a national vote. May the best team win. That simple. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Navy Veteran Nicole Lauer tells CNN's Jim Sciutto: "The Coast Guard is the wall. They are the ones out there actively protecting the borders ... and they are not funded right now."  She says she and her colleagues feel "forgotten," as Coast Guard members will not receive a paycheck for the first time in US history because of the ongoing government shutdown.
Naziism at its finest.  Wake up people.
Need a wall between Russia and you and your cohorts.
Need to know a bit more about this border WALL
Neither do we. Just because he says it doesn't make it true.
Never Give In !!
Never been more prouder of a president of the United States than I am of Donald J Trump!!!! We need you!! Thank you for keeping us safe!!
Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
Never give in, never surrender! Build the wall
Never give in, stand firm and hold out for the wall.
Never give up
Never truer words.
News Flash, what the media and politicians haven't told us. The Syrian war is all but over, for the 1st time since 2011 the first President of a Middle East nation met with Bashir Assad, the President of Sudan, Omar al Bashir. All the middle Eastern Countries closed their embassies back in 2011. It's concluded Assad is the leader of the nation and has won the war. They will be letting Syria back in the 22 member Arab League . President Trump knows this, if we stay we will end up paying to rebuild Syria when their neighbors have agreed to absorb the cost. Politicians and the wealthy that all own stock in Boeing, Northrop, Lockheed, would love for us to keep spending billions on bombs. 2 Americans dying yesterday I Syria as we all know could of happened just as well in France or any other EU country or right here at home... Tell your representatives we're finished in Syria, I followed this conflict closely since 2011, I knew then and now Assad is the lessor of evil in that nation... The sad part of this war, he oldest know cities places like Aleppo going back to 3bc have been blown to pieces. These wars have erased much of structures and cities that have survived since man kind. Gone forever..

Nice picture president Trump
Nicholas, don‚Äôt hold back, tell us.
Nick Amato , they don't have open borders. I needed a passport and they questioned us when we visited. I couldn't just walk on over.
Nick Amato The question was when, not why.
Nick Baker  He has been trying to open the government back up everyday and Democrats are admit they don‚Äôt want a wall. I‚Äôm not going to sound like a die hard republican because I‚Äôm far from it but I do support trump because I believe he truly loves America. If the right democrat runs you bet I‚Äôll vote for them. I‚Äôm not trying nor will I sit here and argue. #unitedwestanddividedwefall
Nick Baker He will a soon as Democrats get off their ass and do what‚Äôs right for the nation
Nick Baker Kevin Lake thinks a government shutdown is a good thing. Hard to understand how one can rationalize that it makes our country safer.
Nick Baker but it was ok when Barry did it? Question why there are so many non essential employees
Nick Baker it is actually vacation for many of them. It is a paid vacation because they will get back pay even though most aren't at work.  The ones who are working , I respect and they should get the back pay but there should be some furrowed because the government has to many non essential workers.
Nick Baker maybe Nancy should start caring about keeping the country safe instead of caring more about liberal BS
Nick Baker maybe the non essential ones should go find another job.
Nick Baker quit listening to that fake news that CNN and MSN spew out . We the people elected Mr. Trump to build that wall. We the people want that wall for our safety , well being and the sake of our children.
Nick Baker tell that to President Nancy she will not give one dollar to the wall. Result shutdown.
Nick Baker there is to much redundancy in government. They need to thin the ranks and actually make people work.
Nick Birkin stupid limey

Nicki Michelle Literally not one person is saying the country shouldn't be secured... this is about nothing but an unneeded vanity wall... there are better ways to spend billions of dollars
Nicki Michelle Yes, you are correct...I‚Äôm hoping that taking the average of all the polls will be more meaningful...Of course the Russian collusion did have an impact....
Nicki Michelle literally no one is trying to "break in"
Nikolai Patrushev, Putin's national security advisor, has just threatened Ukraine with "loss of statehood." Is anyone in this administration still awake?
Nixon2 is coming..........
No ,U !
No I‚Äôm not for or against especially to protect crooked politicians , but what I am against is falsely claiming your patriotism is the reason you‚Äôre doing something when that billions of dollars of money could go to things that would immediately effect Americans daily life‚Äôs, and then to top it off thousands of people are being effected by something they can‚Äôt even control and may bit wvwn belive in all due to one mans agenda, I cannot call that patriotic or love of a country.
No border .. no country ... just take a look at Europe ..
No borders, no nations!
No building an idol for the deplorable.  Impeach the russian backed traitor.
No comrade Dave, here in this country we don‚Äôt allow the tyrant president to do end runs around congress.    We call that a coup, and we execute people for it.
No delay on the SOTU address! Americans want to hear from our president & not Pelosi whose agenda is political & anti/American!   The Pelosi/Schumer shut down has taken a toll on govt workers. Americans will not forget this come the 2020 election, as the Dems will be voted out of office! ALL Americans know they voted for the wall under Obama. Don‚Äôt punish Americans for wanting safety & security, just because they lost & Trump won!
No doubt.  It shows what kind of person you are.    Do you realize how many people around Trump have been charge, indicted, and plead guilty to a plethora or crimes, many leading back to 'individual 1' ?   Do you just ignore all of that, and somehow reason it all out?
No fraud. He's trying to enforce our Constitution and laws. Something the Democrats spit upon now!
No freebies, need more security, we love president trump koodos to him for all Americans
No if the pres doesn't stop pulling the crap he does
No it doesn't.
No it isn't.  Getting your way is the most important thing for you so you can put Putin first
No it won't, if they're carting them in vehicles, they're coming in at a border point.  That would require more staff to check more vehicles.  If they are coming by sea, no wall will stop that
No it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs how much can I grab before I‚Äôm ousted
No joke I thought this was an action figure standing next to the text haha awesome!
No one disagrees
No one is saying we should have open borders.
No one is talking about free anything üòÇ I just mentioned there are immaculate flaws with all.of these and you assume it means free. Amazing.
No one said your a democrat were just pointing out the obvious truth... democrats destroy everything they touch !! Mic drop!!!
No one says the border is, or should be, open. You obviously don't ever cross the border or you would know that.
No ones with you, Trumpturd is an incompetent fool and he‚Äôs a Russian stooge!  #TraitorTrumo
No other country has guns either and they have socialist healthcare. You still think "other countries" is the example you want to use?
No other country has open borders why should we
No other like my brother.
No problem right now president AMLO will help more to M√©xico.... Thank you for nothing.... And Good luck with CHRYSLER and GM automotive taxes...
No proof. Just mad
No reason we can't build our Wall, continue supporting our Kurdish allies in the Middle East, And investigate Nancy Pelosi (treason?) on why she would rather shut down our government than spend just 5 billion on Border Security!!
No she-it? No wall equals no nation? What is it, you got a team of monkeys thinking of these slogans?
No shock the religious ones are the type of hypocrites that support trump.    He needs a deeply uneducated easy to lie to base.    If you are an adult with imaginary friends, you fit the bill.
No the life blood of America is it people, all kinds of people
No they aren‚Äôt. He quite literally said that he would be proud to shut it down and would take credit for it. Try again
No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.   STOP hurting our own citizens - it is IMMORAL.
No two ways about it. God bless President D. Trump.
No wall no nation. Just like that toxic girlfriend.
No wall!!
No we respect him
No, appears your highest priority is getting your way.
No, dumb dumb. Just no.
No, making sure there are enough hamberbers in the Oval Office is YOUR most important duty. Just saying.
No, the people of the Great America need money to survive, we are talking about people who work, so do what is right, must not what you want, give these people a chance to survive ... I voted for you, but you have let me down ...
No, we cease to be a nation when we've forgotten our values and humility. We ceased being a nation the moment you became President.
No, you made making us the puppets of the Russians your highest priority, over covering your sexual indiscretions.  https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation?ref=hpsplash
No. Protect, defend, and uphold the CONSTITUTION is your highest priority.
No. The arresting and prosecution of judges and other officials that commit and enable these crimes by repetitively refusing to enforce the law is what should be you priority to "keep us safe". However, you and EVERY elected official REFUSES to do so in spite of our continued peaceful requests to do so.  Therefore, We the People hereby declare a vote of NO CONFIDENCE for the ENTIRE United States Government, including the states and local government entities.
No....you are wrong.  If we don‚Äôt show humanitarian acts the we cease to be a nation.  Border security yes ...wall no!!!!!!
Noble Loria I'm so afraid that you are right on this one.
Noble Loria not true if by open borders you mean any one can enter without permit from the country authorities.
Nobody will have nothing if not protected from illegal's killing innocent citizens and stealing what we have saved for us.   Our Social Security and our Families.
Nonsense
Noop!! but it will include Chiness great wall:)
Nor do we
Northern border is a really big threat to our security and safety, but you don't care about that...
Not a POTUS, just a POS
Not a penny for a wall! Do not reward chump dump for lying to America! Teach him a lesson!
Not a very smart statement!
Not enough shares of this post!
Not getting a check is worth it to me when it‚Äôs for a good reason  Trump /Pence
Not having borders is how we became a nation... üôà
Not me
Not me, not again. He has shown his total lack of regard for Americans. Keeping the government shutdown because he can‚Äôt get a wall. My husband is a federal contractor for the FAA and won‚Äôt be getting back pay. He isn‚Äôt doing anything to help us.
Not much winning so far.
Not one penny.
Not one service men and women would NOT clap for him todayüòÇ that has never happened before! Do you think its because he started pulling our troops out of Syria or maybe he has not mentioned the 4 service men that got killed with a suicide bomber or not paying for the coast guard with HIS shutdown? He defiantly won't get re-elected in 2020. Your little group won't have enough votes. THANK GOD! Nancy is a very strong lady and i wonder where he's going to give his state of the union address maybe the white house or his plane or maybe his bathroom.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Not only should we, but have a responsibility to secure our border from all that cause harm to our citizens. This does not mean that we ever refuse immigration. Liberals want people to believe that Republicans don't want immigration that is simply a lie.
Not only that the ‚ÄúGovernment Officials ‚Äú protesting the wall live behind walls to protect them from us
Not really.
Not sure how people can say this is about his ego when he is trying to keep ALL Americans safe.
Not sure why that's funny
Not the people?
Not true for donald though
Not your fault its in you're jean
Not!
Note your poll numbers are tanking and even suburban white men show an 18% drop in approval....You make all this love for you up so you feel OK about yourself....It isn‚Äôt working...
Notice how the mentally unstable cannot resist putting their nonsense in? Never even a hint of a reasonable explanation of their positions, just half cocked gibberish empty any Logic, Critical Thinking or formulated thoughts on the subject. this has become the mantra of the left, sniping without substance, It is exactly what Morons do.
Novoa  ! Go  crawl  back  under  Pelosi‚Äôs dress  .
Now Arliss when you "count" do you just use your fingers or do you take off your shoes and use the toes as well?
Now Playing Buzzfeed: Sources say Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress  https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/17/politics/buzzfeed-trump-cohen-lie-congress-moscow/index.html
Now THATs a laugh! Don‚Äôt let Vlad hear you say that.
Now is the time to put extreme intell and all nation allies to join forces to let Isis know no one is going to put up with their actions of destruction. Other wise they will hold our servicemen and  forces at bay while the border crisis is not get the attention it needs, and the Democrats are just trying for any little bit of control they can grab. Not really thinking of their country or servicemen dying and pulled away from their homes. Let Isis know we are pulling out but can joint forces against them if their action still detour the ways if the world. Destroy Isis not just send them hiding.
Now is time for national emergency Mr trump build the wall
Now it is ‚Äú no wall no country‚Äù  Dictator 101  Egomaniac 101  pick your poison
Now see if you can make a priority of the Dam ...sorry Dems
Now we know where their priorities REALLY lie.  Republicans voted to lift sanctions on a Russian oligarch while refusing to vote to reopen the government. They are #RepublicanScum, doing scummy stuff.
Now, who could possibly have a problem with his statement? People who don't care about their country...üò†
Number one duty of the President!  The Americans are behind you!  Stay with it!

Obama gives 150 billion $$$'s to IRAN and President Trump cannot even secure 5.7 billion $$$'s for the WALL/FENCE/BOLLARD - what is wrong with this picture?????  GO PRESIDENT TRUMP and stop NANCY and CHUCKIE.   üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Obama has a handler, Valerie J. Hilary has a handler, Huma A. Trump has A handler, 63+ million patriotic Americans. God bless America
Obama's legacy is welfare king. Foodstamp champion üèÜ Obama's programs failed! Solyndra scandal!! 4 billion dollar cash for clunkers failureüò≥
Obama's top priority was transforming the country into a welfare state with increased gubment control.  Thank you President Trump!
Obie sent it to his terrorist friends in Iran.
Obvious you don‚Äôt care about people not getting paid  It‚Äôs all about you Donny
Obviously a lot of those furloughed jobs are not really necessary for the country to function. I say, let them go permanently.
Obviously not talking about people.
Of Russian
Of all the nerve of them, taking a seven (7) day trip (excursion) in the middle of the shutdown they refuse to negotiate with the Pres. & gov. workers not being paid at that.  If they go anyway by (commercial flight) our  POTUS should declare a National Emergency !!!!
Of course take from the innocent children The rich will be okay But the poor people suffer People will start to rage you will we #throughout #fucktrump #wethepoeple
Of course you are perfect!!!!!!!
Of course-Any Country should have safety.
Oh I thought your campaign for 2020 was your most important duty. Your legacy will be that you made the lives of so very many Americans MISERABLE. You HATED on Americans. You DISCRIMINATED on Americans. You LIED to Americans. You COLLUDED with Russia. But, your ultimate legacy will be far different. You will always be known as the President that DIVIDED AMERICA. Imagine all the good you could have done. You were given the ultimate American opportunity and you squandered it on selfish goals. You could have been great but you just lacked the most critical skill. You lacked the ability to understand the whole of America. Your predecessors understood the importance of being a president for ALL but you missed that. You never stopped being that New York Realtor. What a waste. What a tragic waste.
Oh and dumbass, trump didn‚Äôt even win the majority vote.    The wall is even less popular than he is.
Oh gawd. So not paying our federal employees is good how? Your an idiot and need to jump off a wall. A very tall wall.
Oh get over it already!
Oh go suck UR own dick trump. U rich fucker can pay for that wall. U scared to pay for that wall ? Hum ! Yes !
Oh how cute, Michael H. Witte thinks Trump is going to be on the ballot in 2020, lol.  Adorbs!!!
Oh humpty dumpty built ass nigga
Oh look, another triggered snowflake
Oh lord are you one manipulative bastard, Mr. President. Talking about the defense of our nation when the very federal agencies that protect and prosper us are being shuttered or forced to work without pay.  Agencies within DHS include Coast Guard, Customs and Border Patrol (the very ones who‚Äôre supposed to be protecting our border), Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and even FEMA to an extent. Other agencies impacted within DOJ include FBI, DEA and Attorneys General. Not to mention the Department of State (including all the US Embassies and VISA and passport office), the USDA (which manages the lifeline for farmers) and the Department of Interior (which manages all Federal parks).  Now for USDA and Dept of Interior it might take only a few months to re-hire anyone that left. But for DHS, DOJ, DOS depending on clearance level it could take well over a year to replace someone who left.     How long, Mr. President, do you think all these people can go without a paycheck before they look elsewhere? How impacted will our security and safety be if it takes so long to rehire those in security positions? How impacted will our readiness be to prevent future terrorist attacks?  These are the questions NO ONE is talking about and you are ignoring completely or completely ignorant of. So please, sir, shut the hell up about how you‚Äôre defending us. Because: you aren‚Äôt.
Oh lovely,lam happy to hear this powerful comments by USA action president trump,sir,truly you are dependable,and can be trusted.
Oh no, owe know, current see currency flow, nay shun. Death algorithms, owl go rhythms, ssS5ss5Ssscream it all. President "ray gun", & oblivion claimed him, hem, hymn, in front of the herd, heard. mmm mm m
Oh ok, kNUTson. You're the laughing stock of Edmonton, Alberta :)
Oh please Donnie boy! Such a fraud!
Oh shut it down dumb ass, we‚Äôve a nation all this time with out your wall!  Quit saying defending borders because we do have border patrol
Oh this is gonna be good !!!!!!!!  Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen asserts that that he paid a small tech firm to rig online polls before the 2016 presidential campaign "at the direction of and the sole benefit of" Donald Trump.
Oh twitler,you're done for!
Oh wow is somebody threatening a war at the border
Oh yeah but the 150 billion those illegals cost oh that's not a lot, but by all means bitch about 5 billion
Oh yeah?  Where?  Where is the proof of this?  Stop eating the garbage that is mainstream media, you hack.
Oh yes
Oh, I'm sure that's proof of everyrhing you claim.  Hahahahahhahaha.  What a joke.   I'm positive, after two years being investigated by a partisan group of lawyers, they're just not reporting this collusion or defense of Russia to the nation.  Your side claims Donald Trump is dumb, but he somehow masterminded a betrayal of that size and scope.  Which is it?  Trump is a super genius...or he's dumb and every one of the professionals investigating him is incompetent?
Oh, and by the way, the USA DOES NOT have open borders, so you're stupid on that one too.
Oh, go grow one, Donald. Your most important duty was pretty null and void when you deferred . . .  what was it . . .  five times? What a useless excuse of a man!
Oh, yeah????
Oh... here's another one
Oh.....and having your personal lawyer pay a scum bag techie to mess with the polls
Ok I understand what you're saying Paul and I apologize because you have the right to your opinion just like I do mine. This doesn't change the way I feel about him but I will respect your opinion. However Lawrence I don't think you're all there yourself thanks and goodbye
Ok I went to your Facebook page to see of you are a fake account and in one post you said this, "when a person wants something be mindful they would say anything to get what you have. Listen to your instincts instead of their words". That's what you said and you still voted for Trump
Ok ok, it is a good idea President, holy duty
Ok so what about north border hey they are coming in from Canada...üòí
Ok you want Trump gone have Pence see how you like that
Ok, I do agree with him but I'm tired of hearing politics just declare a national emergency get the wall built and reopen the government and move on to other things that need attention. Like law, enforcement reform get more cops better trained and crack down on crime and violence. Make guns more readily available to able-bodied citizens and if you wanna go big dissolve the democratic party they serve no purpose to us and only damage our nation with hate and bigotry.
Okay Stephen. According to the way we elect presidents in the United states, we elected a president. This president's name is Trump. I don't care who or who doesn't like him. We, the United states of America, have a president. The people, according to years of tradition, have elected Trump as that president. Work harder at getting a viable democratic president.
Okay so lets be totally honest to ourselfs the wall will not solve all the human trafficing issues or prevent anybody from coming when clearly there are plenty tunnels that have been found is it really necessary to have ppl working without pay the same ppl that probably voted for you just so you can feel better about yourself get over it... I know at the age you are in its hard because your once again in your toddler stage your throwing a tantrum, Im a caregiver so I deal with ppl like you everyday sadly its a part of growing old
Okay then tell me what were we before all of this commotion and divisive rhetoric?
Okay, so why did you neglect Puerto Rico, and then show nothing but contempt for the nearly 3,000 people who died there??
Old fat man photoshopped to look less old and fat us a fraud in every way
Omg - just open the gov‚Äôt already you idiot
Omg.  How did America make it through the first half of its existence???
On December 12, Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in federal prison. At his sentencing, Cohen said he acted out of "blind loyalty" to Trump, adding that "time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds."
On point Mr. president. I love saying that.
On the Right Path Mr President. My President. My Pride.
On what grounds and with what evidence? Hurting your feelings is not a good enough reason.
Once again the one who are laughing ARE the domestic Enemies of America..................... God Bless theses United States
One can always tell when you‚Äôre lying because your lips move....
One of the best presidents I have ever seen ‚ù§Ô∏è DONALD TRAMP
One thing I got to say is mankind is one messed-up species I'm surprised we survived this long we are idiots go President Trump best president ever there's a reason why we are different religions we are different colors we speak different languages and we're Dems and Republicans so that we can kill each other and we will Idiots but that is the master plan and you can't get away from it 5 Seconds to genius

Only one party is trading Border Security for illegal votes. That's the Democrats. TSA isn't getting paid because Democrats favor illegals over America's safety. All for votes ...not for anything else either.

Our President Donald Trump is the best President ever

Our borders are fine.... worry about healthcare, jobs, and roads
Our borders arnt what make us a nation mr.president. We the people, together, form our nation. A once great nation before you "made it great again" ü§îü§î
Our country is better protected if there was no shutdown.
Our country is divided again.  Not north and south but by political party.  The Democrats are doing everything in their power to lead us toward socialism.  This will take away our freedoms and put us right back to where we were before 1776.  If you think the Democrats are creating these social programs for your benefit your are wrong.  This is bait in the trap.  Once our freedoms are taken away and the Democrats have complete control all those give away programs will end.  Look at other countries with a socialistic government.  I think the thing that bothers me most is the millions of men and women who gave their lives in past wars to protect us from this very thing.  Such disrespect...  When you are standing in a bread line hoping they won't run out before you get yours then you will understand why these men and women gave their lives freely to protect our country.
Our country's president, Mr Trump, needs to share that directly to Americans by giving his State of the Union address from the White House, NOT in front of disrespectful politicians at the capitol. You know that Pelosi will pack the place with federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay.  Congress is suppose to work for the people. State your case directly to the people and let them call and harass their congressmen until they give in to funding border security. Maybe the SOTU address could be delivered from the East Room with an audience of families who have lost loved ones due to illegals and drug overdose, along with any politician that supports your border strategy.
Our entire family supports you, President Trump. My Facebook profile is discreet, but I represent hundreds in our community who support all of your efforts. Please stay strong. Don‚Äôt believe the negative polls. We need your strength, your country needs your strengths. Bless you Sir.
Our family appreciates your strength and desire to fight for the people!
Our great President get‚Äôs it!! That‚Äôs why common sense hardworking Americans elected him-Let‚Äôs stay with & support him my fellow Deplorables üëçüëçüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Our nation has a stronger backbone than you would care to consider. If we only had a leader of the caliber she deserves!
Our nation isn't so weak that we need walls. Great Wall of China? Scared. Hadrian's Wall? Scared. Berlin Wall? Scared.
Our nation needs a defense from you!
Our nation went downhill from the moment you took office.   Hawaii was an educated bilingual and literate kingdom before it was annexed and it probably would have joined the Commonwealth of the üá¨üáß.  California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, Nevada, and Colorado were part of the Spanish empire and Mexico before our nation started a BS war just to take over land under manifest destiny.  This land was first settled by indigenous peoples, and your ancestors illegally came to this land, pillaged from the Native Americans if not killed them off through bloodshed and disease, only for you to prevent the INEVITABLE. The world is becoming smaller and technology is only making travel and multilingualism more common. You represent an obsolete America. You represent outdated practices. How can you lead the most innovative country in the world when you lack a single innovative bone in your body? You only got by in life because of your bombastic entitled attitude. You are unfit to lead this country and BELONG IN JAIL.   #AnyDemocrat2020
Our president is absolutely correct, if you guys don't understand what he said, or what the consequences will be without the wall, read his statement slowly, think about it imagine it in your mind, who's going to pay for all of these people, where are they going to live. And most but not least who are they? It's that easy folks, no wall, COMPLETE CHAOS, CIVIL WAR and the United States will never be the same again. In fact your constitutional  rights  will be gone. There has to be some control over this you're not all that stupid? Are you?
Our president is very very Wright
Ours too!
Out of all the issues in America he only focuses on this one smh moron
Oval Office SOTU. Problem solved.
Own it Trumpers.You got scammed by a New York con artist indebted to Putin and his fellow oligarchs. Don't let his shutdown distract you from his imminent impeachment proceedings.

Paul Burton stricken 2 my story gay @ that 2!
Paul Burton that's not what open borders means.
Paul Burton what was Muslim Obama excuse?
Paul Burton whatever from the mouth of a gay- bald Peewee Herman- could possibly not be true?
Paul Chiplock, let me ask you a question about this immigration on the border being at a decline. If immigrants are crossing into America undetected in the first place, then living here under the radar, how can they be calculated? Therefore by what logic can a decline narrative be created and be even somewhat accurate?
Paul Chiplock, that‚Äôs the point! How can any entity create a statistic when the premise itself means one would have to include immigrants that came in undetected? How do you account for someone in a statistical way you never saw or otherwise discovered after the fact?   Why do you think there is such a big range in calculating the overall cost of illegal immigration? It‚Äôs from a low of 54 billion to a high of almost 175 billion. That‚Äôs because no one really knows! All of it are estimates based upon supposition without facts. It‚Äôs based on an estimate of 14 million, but if they are in hiding, how does one really know?
Paul Chiplock, then why do some portions of a wall exist today? That means it had to be an issue before? Why not today?

Pelosi & Schumer.. politics as usual!
Pelosi and Schumer‚Äôs plan
Pelosi didn‚Äôt you take an oath to protect the American people (not the Mexican cartel).  I took the oath to protect and defend my country and even though our pay was delayed because the military wasn‚Äôt always given their minute raise we were still at our assigned post.  What makes you any difference?  Oh yea, you‚Äôre STILL GETTING PAID while other aren‚Äôt.  President Trump Homeland Security has support this security event.  HAIRY PELOSI YOU LIE!!!!!!Taking after your sister Hiliary.
Pelosi does not even have the guts to face family members of those killed by illegals. To call her a leader is just pathetic. This problem has been going on for decades. We want it fixed. Permanently.
Pelosi doesn't want to secure our Country, but she is worried about security on the Hill.  Hypocrisy in action!
Pelosi is inviting illegals to California.
Pelosi is more worried about her security than ours.
Pelosi is only House Speaker and Donald Trump is the President of America, you have all the power Pres Trump dont give up. Fight
Pelosi tells the President he shouldn't come to what the Constitution tells him to do. When actually, she is coming to HIS address.   He has Constitutional Authority to CONVENE one or both Houses. That's what he's doing. He's not going to THEIR event, they're coming to his.  That's funny.  Article 2 Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution (Presidential Powers, "He" being the President): (Note: He can adjourn THEM for as long as He wants)  ***** He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union,*****   and recommend to their Consideration   ***** such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; *****   ***** he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, *****   with Respect to the Time of Adjournment,  *****  he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; *****  he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.
Pelosi wants Open Borders. She is on the take from Drug Cartels.  She makes millions on drugs.
Pelosi's PERSONAL VENDETTA comes BEFORE the American citizens!!!
Pencil pushers are starting to freak out about Trump's shutdown, warning that if federal workers miss another paycheck, a drop in economic growth coupled with the loss of consumer and business confidence, combined with Trump's trade war and the long term sting on consumer credit ratings, could trigger a recession. Lucky for Trump, who gauges his success on the ebbs and flows of stock market, Wall Street's 1% hasn't noticed rank-and-file federal workers are on the verge of quitting en masse.  Trump's 2020 campaign manager and pubic beard-in-chief, Brad Parscale, says that they have all this polling data that says they're winning the war on messaging, but he refuses to show anybody. I guess Parscale's model is from a different school three towns over, and isn't available right now because it's currently vacationing in Russia.

People cussing him and calling him the worst names they can think of and relying on him to protect them by giving him nothing to protect them with. Hate blinds their logic. All this because he beat their candidate!! üôÑ WOW...
People don't give up on him, there are 5 other very happy years coming up with President TrumpüòÅüëå
People live from paycheck to paycheck thanks to people like Cuomo that insists he is taking everyone's savings accounts year by year.  I just can not understand why people insist they keep voting him in to get re-elected to do that.  Stupidity has to be put in our foods, or broadcast as subliminal messages in the frequencies filling the air.
People need to contact legislators and tell them to fund the barrier and open the government. Democrats want to fund foreign aide to the tune of $18 billion but can't take $5 billion to fund the wall? I think we should be taking care of our own country and citizens before any other country.
People that hate him because he wants to protect American also hate American. I realize you are not used to a President looking out for the United States of America  since your last President sold us out to the new world order. We are not the worlds parents let them govern themselves.
Peoples wages and lives are NOT
Pepa pig aint getting hes wall period.
Perfect
Perhaps we could simply buy a trillion American made LEGOs for the wall?
Peter Arnold  You r jeolous you don't have the ability that are Great President Trump has! Too,too bad! Keep pushing the Mc Donalds burgers and fries!
Phoebe Cassandra Smith - Educate yourself please. Annual cost of illegal immigration: OVER $84 BILLION. Yet Democrats will NOT spend 5 BILLION to keep Americans safe & stop drugs. WAKE UP TAXPAYERS! #BuildTheWall üá∫üá∏
Phoebe Cassandra Smith American citizens are donating to the Wall. We will get it done around failed government.
Phoebe Cassandra Smith Why Do You mock God?
Phoebe Cassandra Smith actually several do even among so called democrats
Phoebe Cassandra Smith and even though I'm not a great Trump fan I think this politics as usual is a disgrace to this country. The Democrats can end the shutdown just as easily as the president can there's absolutely no doubt about that. and I'm not asking them to go against their own beliefs I'm just asking them to think about coming up with a compromise for something that they themselves have pushed over the past 10 years.
Phoebe Cassandra Smith grass is seems greener on the other side of the fence but are yard is full of ice. Canada open boarders are fucked. Did u know over 1000 Canadian community don't have drinkable water? Does that seem fine to you? If so your a moron.
Phoebe Cassandra Smith it is a matter of security not vanity. Maybe you should leave this conversation to the adults..
Phoebe Cassandra Smith lol yeah you'll see troll
Phoebe Cassandra Smith sounds good, $27 for the wall or $1200 for not wanting to participate.
Phoebe Cassandra Smith we are talking about NOW. There are caravans coming. Not all immigrants are Mexican.
Phoebe Cassandra Smith, that's contrary to what everyone that works on the border is telling us. They are the experts, not you.
Photo shopped.  Then man's obese.

Phyllis Haberkamp Did you hear Marko Rubio?  Nancy Pelosi expects him to unconditionally surrender to her every desire of resisting everything he wants.
Phyllis Haberkamp oh the irony.  Read what you wrote, think about it, and get back to me.
Phyllis Haberkamp:  As it concerns hate wagons:  "Patriotism means to stand by the country. I does not mean to stand by the president."   Theodore Roosevelt.   We've had an immigration problem for decades.  It has been ongoing since before Reagan pardoned all illegals during his administration.  One is na√Øve to think that building an ineffective wall across our southern border will be a solution to a long festering problem.  Are you able to recognize when your being played?
Physical barriers are pointless when you‚Äôre selling us out to Putin and his minions.
Physicians were unable to reach a consensus: Should the U.S. build Trump's Mexican Wall? The Allergists were in favor of scratching it, but the Dermatologists advised not to make any rash moves. The Gastroenterologist's had sort of a gut feeling about it, but the Neurologists thought Trump had a lot of nerve. Meanwhile, Obstetricians felt certain everyone was laboring under a misconception, while the Ophthalmologists considered the idea shortsighted. Pathologists yelled, "Over my dead body!" while the Pediatricians said, "Oh, grow up!" The Psychiatrists thought the whole idea was madness, while the Radiologists could see right through it. Surgeons decided to wash their hands of the whole thing and the Internists claimed it would indeed be a bitter pill to swallow. The Plastic Surgeons opined that this proposal would "put a whole new face on the matter." The Podiatrists thought it was a step forward, but the Urologists were pissed off at the whole idea. Anesthesiologists thought the whole idea was a gas, and those lofty Cardiologists didn't have the heart to say no. In the end, the Proctologists won out, leaving the entire decision up to the assholes in Washington!
Picture of Trump clearly photoshopped to make him look thinner. Is there anything genuine with this guy??
Pigliosi will NEVER compromise. She does NOT care about Americans! BUILDTHEWALLNOW.  Leave the immoral dems in the dust!!!!  #KAG

Potus just talked about Iran's failed launch of what could be an ICBM. Iran probably wants its own "spy satelite" but that could not be all: We know the Iranian Ayatollahs do want nukes: The Shah already had a nuke program. The Shah even admitted that in an interview and explained: "Iran is a Great Power. Why should UK and France have nukes but not Iran?". We also know that the Shia Ayatollahs have great hate for the Wahabist Saudi's (as for the State of Israel and the USA). A Saudi official did warn Iran in the past: "If Iran gets nukes, we already bought them from our friend Pakistan". Pakistan certainly has nukes but probably not these Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. Iran and Saudi do have missiles (Russian, Chinese ?) that can strike each other, possibly also Israel but not ICBMs (yet). Then we also have in our history books the argument of Mao against MAD: Chairman Mao said that he could win a real nuke war with the Sowjets (who had betrayed the real communist Stalin) because, that was Mao's sincere argument, more Chinese would survive than Russians. The Russians absolutely believed Mao was telling what he felt and feared him, also because Mao had no hesitations at all to attack Sowjet troops near the Amoer and Oessoeri rivers. The Ayatollah Khomeiny is not only seen as the True Imam, the legal heir of the True Imams Ali and Husseyn who were betrayed by these "wicked Suni heretics", but also as the Mahdi: the returned Prophet of the Apocalypse.
Praise the Lord we didn't end up with Clinton.  Trump has saved this country from evil plans.

President Donald Trump's former "fixer" Michael Cohen said Thursday that he paid the head of a small technology company thousands in 2015 to rig online polls at "the direction of and for the sole benefit of" Trump.
President Donald Trump's former lawyer and "fixer" Michael Cohen confirmed a Thursday Wall Street Journal report that he paid a small technology firm to rig online polls in favor of Trump ahead of the 2016 campaign. "As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging, what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn't deserve it," Cohen posted to his Twitter account.
President Pence?
President Trump - you are loved by the American people and you have our prayers and support! Thank you for wanting to keep us all safe! The Lord is on your side - God bless you and keep pressing forward! Trump 2020 <3
President Trump 20172025 If Americans  do not replace the Despicable democrats  with Conservatives  , then we risk  being a nation,  remember  the Despicable democrats  led by benedict asshole obama, want to  fundamentally change America,   No border wall/security  ,no balanced budget clause and  no eliminating the discretionary spending clause,    No end to the  shutdown,    Let the Despicable democrats  go on camera saying, "   we want to get 3 million dues paying union workers  back on the job ,:  and screw 300 million Americans  safety "  Thank You God's speed and God bless America and your family
President Trump GOD is with you and so are the American people.  Praying for you, your family, staff, and the American people.
President Trump I did not vote for you but in my opinion you are doing an outstanding job....let this man have his wall....if you want my vote in 2020 you should end The Federal Reserve.....keep up the good work
President Trump Is Right !!
President Trump defends his country.  God Bless him.
President Trump does everything in his power to keep America safe. To bad Pelosis Congress won't get on board.
President Trump has explained why we need secured borders, I would like Nancy to explain how Open Borders help our country and how she is going to protect us from Illegal Aliens that murder rape and assault our citizens.   IF she says she is for border security  then she needs to explain why President Trumps plan doesn't work and what her plan is and explain without using political rhetoric.   WE have an immigration problem and I would like our political leader to fix it for the good of the country not for their own selfish political benefit.
President Trump if you really care about the denfense of our nation you would open the government back up.  Our government is less secure when it is closed.  Praying for you.
President Trump is NOT a Perfect man...but IS the 'Perfect Man'...for this Job...in Leading America...a President who 'loves' his Country...as he is fighting for Border Security with his every Breath...in getting the Funding for a Border Barrier...a much needed physical Structure ....to Stop the Invasion of ILLEGALS...and the flow of Drugs ...Drugrunners...Coyotes... and  Trafficking...entering through the 'Open Border'...
President Trump is a man our nation can count on to do the right thing for our United States.  He is the best.   Thank you President Trump and God Bless You.  üíïüá∫üá∏Ô∏èüíï
President Trump is our choice. He has the best interests of our country at heart. God bless his efforts and our country.üëçüá∫üá∏üôèüèº
President Trump is the best President in a long time. He's doing everything that he said during his campaign for President. Go Build the Wall and leave President Trump alone so he can finish making America Great Again
President Trump is the man
President Trump it has to be the most important. Because liberal Democrats want to sell our country out
President Trump keep fighting for America...Jesus was persecuted too and we killed him you are chosen to do this job last administration was weak and hate America not wonder why Obama's network before he enter to the WH was only 1 million 1/2 after now his network is 45 millions??? How this happened...this guy didnt wrote a book or invented nothing to make this amount of money as a president with a salary of 400 hundred thou...we can see how crooked he was not wonder why our Country is in a such big whole üëéüëéüëé
President Trump keeps trying to make America safe and is fought every step of the way.  So sad
President Trump kept his campaign promises, gave up his salaries to charities; loves America and its people; taking crap and worse from f**ked up liberal MSM, Dems, Socialists and those damned snowflakes; creating jobs; growing the economy; stock market rising like the sun; rolling back business stifling regulations; re-negotiating better trade deals for America; bringing back manufacturing jobs; raised the GDP; re-building our military; shamed the nations into paying their share of the UN budget; fighting damn hard to defend our southern border, etc., etc., y'all know the rest. WHAT OTHER PRESIDENT DID AS MUCH??? CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHO DID BETTER THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP???  #TRUMPISTRUMPING #MAGA #TRUMP2020
President Trump let the people of the U.S.A voice be heard let the people vote for the wall!
President Trump needs to call a mandatory bi-partisan team building exercise. Those who refuse to attend do not get paid. He needs to fly everyone to an unsecured section of the southern border where they will all camp out in tents, without the security of walls or fences. I wonder how many Democrats would make it through the night before leaving and heading home to hide behind their own walls?
President Trump personally directed his longtime former attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project, two federal law enforcement officials involved in an investigation of the matter told BuzzFeed cnn.it/2QUjuEF
President Trump please keep standing strong against these anti-American, Globalists, Open Borders people! "We The People" want you to build the Wall for our protection! Thank you and God bless you, Sir!üíñ
President Trump please save our country.
President Trump takes a working vacation at the White House and its called a Shutdown.  Muslim Obama took a NON-WORKING vacation and its called golf. @@@
President Trump told you all that he would get Mexico to pay for the wall
President Trump you are a very good citizen
President Trump you have won the election in 2020
President Trump's The Best Commander in Chief!
President Trump,  A suggestion...how about you hold the State of the Union in Senate chambers and invite Patriots like Angel Families and Veterans...they could sit in the empty seats?
President Trump,  If you were able to freeze ALL THE SENATES BENEFITS, including their pay, hospitalization, retirement funds etc, I believe they would approve the wall within minutes.  God bless you sir, and our great country!
President Trump, I think you will find super interesting things in our Alibaba Shop: www.yftsextoy.en.alibaba.com
President Trump, appreciate all you do!  Have your address & Tell the American people that Pelosi is worried about her security & not the American security we want at the border + the wall. She does not want you to talk about the border to the American people . She knows she has voted for it before & is doing it to spite you. Have the cameras on her when the border is discussed or the familes are discussed. Thank you!
President Trump, if you really want to connect with the American people, have a fireside State of the Union address.  That way you will have their undivided attention without interruption from the radical democrats.
President Trump, instead of having the SOTU Address being held in Congress, maybe move it to either the oval office or the southern border itself and stand with Border Agents and Angel Parents.
President Trump, just go for the executive order. Leave the Dems behind. The people need you.
President Trump, keep up the great work!!
President Trump, please allow Americans to donate to the steel slat wall and have our name & message embossed on a slat!  Takes care of financing, and America can pocket the income generated by Mexico on the USMCA trade deal!!  Win/Win!  America First üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üôèüèÜüëèüëå
President Trump, stay strong!!!  We live you & what you're doing!!!
President Trump, why cannot some of the funds from the Wall come from the money taken by, whoever it was, from the Social Security fund? Why are politicians still being paid when government workers who are doing their jobs are not? Why do politicians even get paid at all when they are not taking care of business? Politicians work for the people that elected them, not for illegals and criminals, and they were not elected to line their own pockets. This Wall is referred to as "Trumps Wall", it is not Trumps Wall it is America's and the American peoples Wall. Why are you getting all the blame when the left is fighting you every step of the way. What happened to all the funds that were allocated for the Wall before you even thought about running for President? Mr. President, what can we, the American people do to help you and ourselves? How do we go about setting term limits for Congress since they continue to pass laws that exclude them from having to buy Obama Care, etc., So many questions, so many problems and issues. What can we do?
President Trump, you are doing a great job. Stay firm & strong. Pelosi & Schumer are jealous that a non-politician is doing his job + better than any other president has. Also, please have your "Address"--don't allow her to stop your voice. She  says is it is about security--but the truth is, it's her security she is worried about and not the American people who want our border security + the wall.
President Trump, you are the best! ! !
President Trump, your people are praying for you daily! Our Lord GOD cannot be stopped by anyone! Thank you for your service to our beloved America!‚≠êÔ∏è
President Trump,Many people in the no, know.  you are the man.
President Trump.. please close our borders and order all illegals to be deported to open up jobs for our military men and women whom you are bringing home. #AmericaFirst!
President Trump.....use seized dollars to build the wall!
President Trump: please move the SOTU speech.  Nothing says you have to give it in the House.  Nancy Peloso looks foolish!!
President Trump‚Äôs Attorney General nominee William Barr made his way through Senate confirmation hearings this week.   I knew Barr had previously endorsed gun control policies when he served as Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush in the early ‚Äò90s.   But when Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) asked about his views on gun control today, I never imagined I‚Äôd hear a response like this.   Barr began by discretely referencing ‚ÄúERPOs,‚Äù which stands for ‚ÄúExtreme Risk Protection Orders‚Äù before wholeheartedly offering his endorsement for a nationwide gun confiscation and registration scheme.
President of USA ... Why not PRESIDENT of the WORLD ???  All nations want to say Donald Trump Is Our President !

Presley Mark I think you're so stupid that you don't know what your own position is. Have fun with your liberal, socialized, anti-private property wall.
Presley Mark That‚Äôs because the average person who comes over the wall using a ladder has more to offer America than you, the supporter of a democrat who wants to build a socialized wall using eminent domain, stealing property from Americans to build a wall that will stop virtually zero illegal immigrants or drugs. Have fun with that, ya lib!
Presley Mark really? Prove it didn‚Äôt happen. I seen the footage , pictures and interviews.. what do you have, a fake news site ?
Presley Mark so he‚Äôs going to trigger himself and the fools who voted for him? That‚Äôs cute, cause they‚Äôre usually too dumb to see that they‚Äôre on the losing end of his policies. Dumb!
Pretty sure  thats that‚Äôs what  they  want .    ‚òπÔ∏è
Pretty sure we have been fine all this time without a wall. we will cease to have a nation because.you shut it down.
Prison walls dont stop criminals what makes yall Republicunts think it will stop illegal immigrants from getting here. Yall are really that dumb

R.I.P. United States of America!!! You raised the cost of living so high that both parents are always at work, rather than spending time with their children (single parents stand no chance). You took God out of schools. Parents were told 'No you can't discipline your kids'. Well, America, our kids are disrespectful. You shall reap what you sow, and we have lost a whole generation and turned them into rude, selfish, brats who have no respect for people, property or authority! You deemed people with terminal illnesses and some with only a few months to live‚Ä¶fit for work!!! You allow our veterans of war to go homeless and hungry but give out millions to foreign aid!!! You save drug addicts over and over again but refuse to give free diabetic supplies. You bend over backwards to be politically correct, too scared to say enough is enough, in case you offend. You put the retirement age up so people must work until they drop!! People depend on handouts and food banks, while we give aid to others who can work for it. Our retired generation rely on inadequate state pensions, their thanks for working hard. Things need to change!

Reading of the letter to the Hebrews (3, 7-14)  The Holy Spirit says: Oh, that today you would hear his voice,  "Harden not your hearts as at the rebellion in the day of testing in the desert, where your ancestors tested and tried me and saw my works for forty years. Because of this I was provoked with that generation and I said, 'They have always been of erring heart, and they do not know my ways.' As I swore in my wrath, " They shall not enter into my rest. "' Take care, brothers and sisters, that none of you may have an evil and unfaithful heart, so as to forsake the living God. Encourage yourselves daily while it is still "today,"  so that none of you may grow hardened by the deceit of sin.

Real News (Axios):  Republican Rep. Will Hurd, whose district shares 820 miles of the border with Mexico, says Trump's border crisis is a "myth," and that his wall is the "most expensive and least effective way to do border security."

Real News: On Saturday night, Breitbart panned Mr. Trump‚Äôs latest idea with the headline ‚ÄúThree-Year Amnesty, Most of Border Remains Open.‚Äù  In Trump‚Äôs Immigration Announcement, a Compromise Snubbed All Around  President Trump offered on Saturday to trade temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for border wall funding.  By Julie Hirschfeld Davis Jan. 19, 2019 WASHINGTON ‚Äî Immigrant advocates denounced it as cruel. The conservative right howled that it was amnesty.  What President Trump billed on Saturday as a compromise to end the country‚Äôs longest government shutdown pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs to strike a deal nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall.  Instead, in offering temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for funding for a wall, Mr. Trump did something rarely seen during his presidency. He tried to reach beyond his base of supporters ‚Äî which polls have begun to show is losing patience with him as the partial shutdown drags into its fifth week ‚Äî and speak to a broader swath of Americans.  The Saturday afternoon speech from the West Wing was an attempt by Mr. Trump to, at the very least, shift the narrative of the past several weeks and show that rather than spoiling for a longer shutdown fight or making unreasonable demands, he was looking for a broadly acceptable way out of a morass he once boasted he was proud to wade into.  ‚ÄúI think you could tell by the president‚Äôs remarks today,‚Äù Vice President Mike Pence said, ‚Äúthat we‚Äôre reaching out.‚Äù  Yet in seeking to inch toward the center, Mr. Trump alienated portions of his hard-right base, the core supporters he most depends on and the group he and his closest aides have most feared losing. That raised the possibility that, in his zeal to get out of an intractable situation, he may have landed himself in the worst of all worlds, without a clear solution or the support of his most ardent followers.  The tensions and anger over the policy have been quietly playing out in the West Wing as well, as Jared Kushner, the president‚Äôs son-in-law and senior adviser, fended off Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump‚Äôs immigration agenda. Mr. Kushner has long been a proponent of protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, while Mr. Miller has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration.  In recent days, as White House officials had been working out the details of the compromise, Mr. Miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity.  While the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that protected those illegally brought to the United States as children, Mr. Trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700,000 who are enrolled.  Mr. Kushner conceded in a briefing after the president‚Äôs speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the DACA program, which Mr. Trump moved to rescind in 2017.  ‚ÄúAt this moment in time,‚Äù Mr. Kushner said, ‚Äúthis is a good path forward.‚Äù  Many conservatives did not share that view.  ‚ÄúTrump proposes amnesty,‚Äù the conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Twitter. ‚ÄúWe voted for Trump and got Jeb!‚Äù she added, referring to Jeb Bush, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status.  Still, in the eyes of many White House officials, the prospect that Mr. Trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure Democrats to end the impasse was worth trying. Mr. Pence argued on Saturday that the speech was a ‚Äúsincere effort‚Äù by Mr. Trump to break the logjam, and he and other White House officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist Democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with Republicans.  But such a coalition did not appear to be forming, and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention, eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak-kneed capitulation.  The vast majority of Democrats knocked the approach. While many of them have pressed for measures to protect DACA recipients and immigrants living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe, most regard the proposal he put forth on Saturday as woefully inadequate. It offers only three years of protections for the DACA recipients and those who hold T.P.S., which the Trump administration has also moved to end for several countries.  ‚ÄúThis is not an amnesty bill,‚Äù Mr. Pence said. ‚ÄúThere is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal.‚Äù  That was high on Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs list of reasons to call the plan ‚Äúunacceptable.‚Äù  That is unlikely to matter to the president. Despite saying publicly last month that he would be proud to own a shutdown over the wall, and privately displaying confidence that his base would stick with him through the fight, Mr. Trump has been dismayed to find otherwise in recent days.  An NPR poll released last week showed Mr. Trump‚Äôs approval ratings down and the first cracks in backing among critical supporters, including whites without a college education and white evangelicals.  Such pressure from what he has called the forgotten men and women who elected him and chant ‚ÄúBuild! The! Wall!‚Äù at his arena rallies has swayed Mr. Trump before, including last year, when the conservative news site Breitbart branded him ‚ÄúAmnesty Don‚Äù for considering a similar deal that would have provided $25 billion in wall funding for a path to legal status for those the DACA program was created to help. The president ultimately abandoned that agreement, concerned about angering his base and after Mr. Miller and others advised him he should insist on additional immigration restrictions.
Real News: Two very sober and thoroughly argued calls for the House of Representatives to launch an impeachment investigation (to see if impeachment is warranted):  https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-hayden-and-neal-katyal-the-house-should-investigate-impeaching-trump/2019/01/18/0588e84a-1b70-11e9-88fe-f9f77a3bcb6c_story.html  https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/impeachment-trump/580468/  The first is written by Michael Hayden and Neal Katyal in the Washington Post. The second is written for The Atlantic by Yoni Appelbaum, who notes:   ‚ÄúImpeachment is a process, not an outcome, a rule-bound procedure for investigating a president, considering evidence, formulating charges, and deciding whether to continue on to trial.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAs a House Judiciary Committee staff report put it in 1974, in the midst of the Watergate investigation: ‚ÄòThe purpose of impeachment is not personal punishment; its function is primarily to maintain constitutional government.‚Äò Impeachable offenses, it found, included ‚Äòundermining the integrity of office, disregard of constitutional duties and oath of office, arrogation of power, abuse of the governmental process, adverse impact on the system of government.‚Äô‚Äù
Real News: When #BigotPresident meets #MoronPresident: San Antonio does not have a border wall and is 157 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.  President Trump incorrectly claims San Antonio has a border wall  Speaking to reporters Saturday, the president cited San Antonio's nonexistent border wall as the source of improved security in the city.  January 19, 2019 WASHINGTON, D.C., USA ‚Äî Ahead of his "special announcement" Saturday on the government shutdown and the border, President Trump told reporters that "walls work," citing San Antonio's security improvement since putting up a wall.  "You look at different places," Trump told members of the media, "they put up a wall, no problem. You look at San Antonio, you look at so many different places. They go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities immediately. Immediately. It works, we have to put them up, and we will put them up. We've got to."  San Antonio, however, does not have a border wall and is 157 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.  Trump visited the Rio Grande Valley along the edge of the U.S.-Mexico border last week. During his visit, the president took part in a roundtable discussion on border security and met with Border Patrol agents stationed along the border.  Throughout the government shutdown, which has lasted nearly a month, Trump has insisted that a crisis exists at the border which would be fixed by a border wall.  During the president's visit, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told him the state will build a wall along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border if the federal government pays Texas back.

Rick Voss Obama quickly, but not soon enough, that the Kim family is not to trusted. Trump hasn't figured that out yet. Perhaps Fox and Brietbart forgot to mention it to their audiences, but NK is continuing to build and develop missiles and nukes. All Kim has to do is to continue to send Trump love letters.

Rita Lambert You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress. Can you think of a reason he didn‚Äôt do it when he could?
Rob Jandl you need the lego. You sound like a child.
Rob Kettner F*CK YOU !!!!
Rob Kettner show me one thats similar. Stretching the truth doesnt make you right.
Rob Novoa which rock have you been under??  Citing on a February 2017 CIS analysis that used methods of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) Camarota begins diving into the numbers ‚Äî and they are jarring. ‚Äú(Based on the 2017 analysis) we estimate that each crosser creates a net cost of $74,722 (taxes paid minus costs) during his or her lifetime, excluding costs for their U.S.-born children. The figures from the NAS study are in 2012 dollars; converting them to 2018 dollars would raise them to $82,191. This estimate means that for every 100,000 illegal immigrants prevented from crossing illegally, it would save taxpayers $8.2 billion over the illegal immigrants‚Äô lifetimes,‚Äù Camarota writes. That figure, $8.2 billion, seems a lot more costly than $5 billion. But surely, there can‚Äôt possible be 100,000 illegal immigrants crossing, right? ‚Äú(Border Patrol data) implies that the number of successful crossers in 2018 was between 173,731 and 203,476, which we round to 170,000 and 200,000 in this report for convenience,‚Äù Camarota adds. Based on those numbers, that $5 billion wall would only have to stop about 3 to 4 percent of illegal immigrants in the next decade to pay for itself.

Robert White Obama created policy that protected Americans from 5 most dangerous countries. Trump opened the boarder to them. Obama created policy to modernize the wall. Trump caged babies. Never forget 9-11 16 terrorists were Saudi. They were Saudi trained. They were Saudi financed. ZERO were Mexican. Zero arrived from Mexico. Zero would have been stopped by a idiotic wall! This man tRump and his son-in-law just sold $billion weapons to the only people, the Saudis, who've attacked America. Trump and GOP just allowed the Saudi Prince to murder and dismember Khashoggi. Makes you think.
Robert White You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress.
Robert White agree

Rod Novoa üñïüèª
Rod Novoa, first thing for someone when he gets somewhere, like you who gets in USA, is to know how to behave, how to be grateful because USA accepted you, your mom and dad... Don't be so rude to someone who believes different. By mocking Trumps presiding, you're mocking more than half of Americans who supports him.
Rod Novoa, would you like a tissue for your presidential issue?
Rod Novoa,Really did you not feel that way when Obama was in office giving all the tax payers money to overseas?
Rod Novoa.  Trump is our PRESIDENT  !!!  Get over it already ...
Rod Novoa... really ??? On what ground , you dumbass !!
Rod Novoa.So what he did with north Korea the last 8 president's could not do. The only thing obama did was gay marriage that is one of the most disgusting laws that have ever passed.

Rudy Giuliani says Trump didn't collude with Russia but can't say if campaign aides did  (CNN) Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday that he never denied President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign, only that the President himself was not involved in collusion.  In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on "Cuomo Prime Time," Giuliani, a former New York mayor and Trump's attorney, said he doesn't know if other people in the campaign, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, were working with the Kremlin during the 2016 presidential race.  "I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign," Giuliani said.  He added, "I said the President of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the President of the United States committed the only crime you can commit here, conspiring with the Russians to hack the DNC."

Ruth Mosley I'm not going to stoop to your level
Ruth Mosley Poor baby hillary lost
Ruth Mosley This is youüë≥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ruth Mosley What has he done that makes him a criminal?
Ruth Mosley actually President Trump has the legal authority to build the wall all he hase  to do is to clear a state of emergency. Which he does not need Congress for and use the money from the defense department who do you think is in charge of the United States defense department? the president of the United States is the Commander in Chief of all our Armed Forces he already has the money in for the National Defense from last year. So legally he doesn't even need the Democratic party or congress once he declares martial law in a state of emergency down at the border which he legally can because it is a threat to all Americans the military will build the wall.
Ruth Mosley it‚Äôs actually higher, around 82%. Only anti Americans don‚Äôt want Americans to be better protected.
Ruth Mosley leave America!
Ruth Mosley not likely their Ruth! I‚Äôm sure the dictatorship of Obama forcing the American people to buy healthcare will go down in the history books though!

Ruth Mosley, Sry but Trump's NOT going anywhere just bc he hurt you're poor lil feelings it doesn't incall for impeachment. Now if you do succeed in impeaching him it will be bc YOU have broken our Laws to do so. So if I were you I'd prepare for a War if he does. Bc there are abunch of Patriotic Americans who will be P***ed bc were getting tired of all the PC BULLSH*T. Plus the campaign promises becomes a lie when it comes to the Dems.

The Democrats and the MAJORITY  of Americans want to hire more Border Patrol Agents and use MODERN METHODS  like drones, not useless walls. There was NEVER going to be a wall from Coast to Coast anyway! Why doesn't MCCONNELL allow a Senate vote!!!!!! Shame on the REPUBLICANS for not forcing MCCONNELL!!!!

SHUT THE BORDER DOWN NOW.
SHUTDOWN SHELTERS: Domestic violence shelters are cutting services as federal funds run out. It's Day 27 of America's longest government shutdown 'We're going to stay out for a long time,' Pres. Trump said this week as he continues to refuse to re-open the government without $5.7 billion for a border wall.

Sadly, some actually don‚Äôt care. America has not seen this heightened level of dirt and corruption..This isn‚Äôt a presidency: It‚Äôs a poorly staffed and dilapidated crime syndicate. Entitled sociopathic thugs whose depravity is only matched by their overwhelming incompetence. An endless stream of human sewage somehow passing itself off as an ‚Äúadministration‚Äù
Sadly.    Does not make it right.

Sally Gillespie Bailey Starving border guards are in no way corruptible, and fully attentive.
Sally Gillespie Bailey YES!  And pay me Coast Guard son for doing his job.  Every.  Single.  Day.
Sally Gillespie Bailey do you think our TSA agents are not effective.   I am insulted. Doing our job every day without a paycheck

Sally Gillespie Bailey no Congress needs to do their JOB and keep their promises to secure our border made during the Reagan Administration and  again in 2006!
Sally Gillespie Bailey not going to work sweetie. You'll have to try harder.
Sally Gillespie Bailey the president is stupid plain and simple!! Screw Trump and the wall!
Sam Godin there are already 650 miles of wall at the border.  How do walls find people or drugs smuggled in at ports of entry?  Why do you folks insist on one solution to a problem?

Samoan Dannielle stupidity at its finest.
Samoan Dannielle true
Samoan Dannielle what  did  DEMS  ever  do...they  will  raise  your  taxes  and spend  the  money.    DEMS  are  the  ones  who  spent  the  Social  Security  funds  and  NEVER  put  it  back  in  the  budget.  The  TAX  CUTS  was  for  all  Americans....for  your  first  $25,000  you  are  not  taxed  plus  President  Trump  gave  Us  more  of  an exemption...PLUS  paychecks  sees  anywhere  from  20  to  100  dollars  more....
Samuel Gonz√°lez  That is a false analogy for two reasons.  1.  You home and the countries borders are not the same thing.  You do not have anyone applying  for asylum, for example.  2.  There is no threat at our southern border.
Samuel Gonz√°lez  Throw away that Nest camera for $100 and build a $50,000 wall round your house dude üòÇ
Samuel Gonz√°lez how many times have you needed to have a ten foot wall around your house for protection???
Sandra Gressett the data and experts don't agree with you.  There is no security crisis at the border. That's why the Republican controlled Congress didn't fund Trump's vanity wall last year or the year before. We are continuing with reasonable and planned border security infrastructure.
Sandra Hughes, it would have been a disaster with that evil woman!
Sandy Nicholson nobody wants to migrate to Canada. That‚Äôs why lol

Sandy Swaney Mahady by "whats right" I'm assuming you mean pass legislation to re-open the government so those 800k workers can get paid? House Democrats passed a spending bill that Senate Republicans previously passed 100-0. Why won't Mitch McConnell allow a vote?
Sandy Swaney Mahady please look at all the polls (30 some) add them together and divide....You will get a much better picture....

Sarah Elizabeth Cracker
Sarah Elizabeth Nope, there were too many poli-ticks in the republican party too.  Reps and Sens swear an oath to negotiate for their constituents needs, in good faith, to determine national policy.  It is clear they have all been playing a kid's 'Man-O-War' game for over 30 years.  We need leadership not posturing!
Sarah Elizabeth Uncle tom was a good guy dumbass
Sarah Elizabeth had the house. Most votes in Senate require 60 votes. He only had 51. Want to try again.
Sarah Elizabeth how about you use your head and think for yourself just like Sheldon does.  Ignorant fool.

Sarah Knutson   Lol, this is hilarious coming from a brainwashed liberal Canuck.
Sarah Knutson , really??? How would you know that.CNN??? Lol You don't know what you are talking about
Sarah Knutson BS...us 61 million are laughing at you
Sarah Knutson I don't care what people all over the world think. I care about my country . How about the US stops sending money to other countries, let's see who will be laughing then ?
Sarah Knutson I think that honour goes to Trudeau actually... Terrible deals, embarrassed in China, playing Mr. Dress up, and doing nothing but crying and apologizing.
Sarah Knutson Only 30% of the country likes this cocksucker. The rest of us have common sense
Sarah Knutson Please..can you think for yourself??  What has Trump done that you hate him so much?
Sarah Knutson Trump supporters just laugh at you out of touch liberals .. ha ha ha.
Sarah Knutson What ever you smoke is way way way to strong for you #remove Sarah
Sarah Knutson as we see Canada is not America  we don't care about your  liberal crap. Oh and Canadian people come into America illegally all the time. So we probably need a wall up there also
Sarah Knutson easy to judge from the outside
Sarah Knutson finally have a president that cares about the security of the American people.  Democrats are a disgrace to this country!
Sarah Knutson good thing Americans don't care what the rest of the world thinks
Sarah Knutson if your talking about our President take your head out of your ass and don‚Äôt be astounded. He is making them pay their fair share . They are crying not laughing. You as a pathetic little American don‚Äôt understand that.
Sarah Knutson it always amazes me how people stick their two cents worth where it's not wanted nor do we care what you outside of the United states of America think. Worry about your country .
Sarah Knutson it astounds me that somebody might like you! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Rick
Sarah Knutson it astounds me that someone might actually like you!  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Rick
Sarah Knutson please read my reply again. Maybe you will learn something.
Sarah Knutson shows how stupid you Canadians are
Sarah Knutson they are not laughing they  are crying because Trump evened the trading field and countries are not sucking Americans dry anymore.
Sarah Knutson too many stupid people. He could piss in their faces and they still would feel blessed.
Sarah Knutson we don‚Äôt like him we LOVE him
Sarah Knutson what world do you live in...the world of fake news?
Sarah Knutson wrong! All french people admire your president. If you want to change, we give you Macron üòÇ
Sarah Knutson you have to be a citizen here to have any validity on what you comment. Bye üëãüèª
Sarah Knutson, you speak for the whole world, eh? ü§î
Sarah Knutson,...hardly.  The world is coming to the realization that what Trump says makes sense.   Had to #WalkAway
Sarah Knutson. Your world
Sarah Knutson: But it is alright in your eyes that your leader of Canada has allowed so many Terrorist affiliated and dangerous people into your country with open arms.  A government that has stripped you of your rights to bear arms in your homes to protect yourselves.  Thankfully here in the USA, we still have our 2nd Amendment Rights to bear arms.  Tune up your own country before you try to tune up ours.
Sarah it astounds me on who would want to go to Canada!!!!
Sarah, that's because you have the most basic idea of life wrong.  You say on your FB page that you believe in the basic goodness of people. You are young and havent got a grip on reality yet.  All leftists look at the world this way.  People are not all good.  Unfortunately many are evil.  That's why we need conservatives to do the work of protecting.  Your effeminate leftist men can't protect anything while wearing a dress.  Don't worry tho.  You've got men down here in the US protecting that chunk of ice you call Canada.
Sarah.. WRONG.  Trump is well respected by world leaders unlike drunken HIllary or Ovomit.  You speak for yourself..nothing more.  MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN1

Secret Service agents are working without pay during the shutdown. One agent warned how that could be dangerous.  "If you've got guys thinking about how they're going to make their house payment, I can just tell you, you're not doing your job right. Your head is not in the right place ‚Äî this is affecting people."  üò•üò∞ Secret Service maintains mission in face of shutdown, but lack of pay hurting morale
Security of our people and nation SHOULD be the most important thing.
See look at how The Libtards treat Blacks who don't agree with them. There Proof that they hate on Blacks who don't agree with them!
Seems it was not important to our last president.
Seems like a pretty obvious thing
Seems like following putins agenda is your highest priority.

Send all the illegal aliens to Nancy's house to tear down her wall, doors and windows and let them all move in with her.
Send her ass to Honduras and Guatemala, find out if she can gather intel as to why these people are being treated poorly and maybe kick the oppressors ass, roll that funding into the wall package , rather than just sending unaccounted billions around the world üåé

Serious, Real News: My Client Resigned From the White House. It's Time for Trump to Think About His Children and Do the Same  Impeachment should be far from the President's only concern By Martin London (VP Spiro T Agnew‚Äôs attorney, back in the day)  The BuzzFeed report that former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has told investigators that, after the election, President Trump instructed him to lie to Congress has raised new calls for impeachment. But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen‚Äôs testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions ‚Äúinternal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents‚Äù) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family ‚Äî specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. ‚Äî knew the details of Cohen‚Äôs secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as ‚Äúdeep involvement‚Äù in the discussions with Russia ‚Äî a subject they‚Äôve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had ‚Äúextensive discussions‚Äù with the family members. The outlet‚Äôs two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them ‚Äúvery detailed updates.‚Äù If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump‚Äôs firm support in the Senate ‚Äî which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House ‚Äî dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President‚Äôs immediate concern is Mueller. This is not like Trump firing of then‚ÄìFBI Director James Comey, which lawyers can challenge because it was technically within the President‚Äôs constitutional power to do so for any reason, good or bad. This is conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony. There can be no argument that the President has the Constitutional authority to conspire to, say, cause somebody to rob a bank ‚Äî or commit any other felony, such as giving perjurious testimony concerning the President‚Äôs conduct.  Don‚Äôt forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex‚Äìcampaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President‚Äôs power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer ‚Äî and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?  At some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment. The longer the President waits, the more evidence piles up, and the tougher it will be to get a deal. Mueller already has a federal grand jury hearing evidence that just received a six-month extension. The President should make his deal before that body completes its work. The Mueller report may accompany a clutch of Mueller indictments.
Shame on you Sir for holding Your citizens pay hostage. Shame on You!
Shamir Dehghani PREACH YOUNG KING
Shamir Dehghani only an idiot would state that , I don‚Äôt think you ever traveled to Europe because if you are talking about he Schengen status here‚Äôs how it works : if you want to immigrate to any of the Schengen countries LEGALLY , you need to apply for a visa in one of those and land FIRST in the country you took the visa from , then you can go from Schengen country to another freely , ONLY if your visa states MULTIPLE ENTRIES on it ! If NOT , the only country you can go to , is the one you took visa for . Now those Schengen countries signed a deal with regulations that makes them like different states . You sure have open borders from one state to the other but as long as you came to the states altogether , LEGALLY , in the first place . Got it ? Ignorance at its finest !

Sheila Lessing  That was proven to be a fake quote.  It came from a Meme out of Russia.  Do much fact checking?
Sheila Lessing  üñïüèº
Sheila Lessing what does that matter when you have this?  "What you really need to do is go back in the ‚Äô30s, when they outlawed all types of drugs in Kansas (and) across the United States. What was the reason why they did that? One of the reasons why, I hate to say it, was that the African Americans, they were basically users and they basically responded the worst off to those drugs just because of their character makeup, their genetics, and that.  Alford‚Äôs comments referenced a belief promoted by marijuana prohibitionist Harry Anslinger, the founding commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.  ‚ÄúUnder Anslinger‚Äôs leadership, the FBN came to be considered responsible for the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937,‚Äù the report noted, ‚Äúregulating cannabis and further taxing it to the ultimate detriment of the hemp industry that was booming at the time.‚Äù  ‚ÄúReefer makes darkies think they‚Äôre as good as white men,‚Äù Anslinger said once when explaining why marijuana supposedly caused crime and violence. The commissioner also fought for the prohibition of cannabis due to ‚Äúits effect on the degenerate races.‚Äù "  https://www.patheos.com/blogs/progressivesecularhumanist/2018/01/gop-lawmaker-blacks-cant-handle-marijuana-genetics/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=share_bar&fbclid=IwAR1a0r6zt3lIAcIO4el5QMMrUbkxjQcIiXmhb0VqxyrhcukaAC1GqunkSjM#ZL0Xf6bLCtu2GRhH.01

Shelby Canada you must not know a lot of black people.

President Trump is a blessing, just what America needed after having to deal with political jerks that are not defending our country but instead have been helping the people that are being fought by our soldiers and their being killed by equipment being left for the enemy to use to against America. And the Dumocrats keep putting people into position jobs to fight the only person that has our best interest at heart. Stop using our tax payers money to finance illegals, it's not okay with us, what the hell is wrong with you idiots. We're tired of what is taking place so we have to fight for our rights because we sure can't count on the governors that are getting into offices that I know I for one would never have voted for, you started this now we citizens with sense will have to take you on morons.

Shut down the borders until the wall is built
Shut it down under furlough! Drain that swamp!
Shut the border down now.  Mexico is reporting several caravans heading towards our border.  Declare a National Emergency for repairs/replacing the fence that congress should be allocating financing to per the Secure Fence Act 2006.
Shut the government down for as long as you have to, as well as stop giving billions of dollars in aid to these corrupt countries.  Nancy and Chuck are evil.   Thank you President Trump for protecting us and our future.

So ... our elected leaders have reached the point where they are semi-openly acknowledging that they are entirely powerless to reopen the government and need a deus ex machina -- people outraged at airport lines -- in order to have any hope of returning things to "normal."
So I see you've had them photoshop you somewhat,
So NO,  YOU do NOT have that RIGHT!
So PAY THE F*CKING COAST GUARD. You're putting us all at risk.
So True! Yet Ignorant Liberals can‚Äôt figure that out!
So Unpresidential!
So basically, if the citizens don‚Äôt fund the border wall, the United States won‚Äôt exist?
So because we have no wall we have never been a nation??? ü§î
So by Donald Dumbs logic the united states never was a nation because it never had a huge wall next to Mexico. Seems legit.
So claims the sissy rich boy who dodged the draft and insulted war hero‚Äôs like Captain John McCain. President Bush and GW loathed Trump for a good reason
So declare a Sate of Emergency and BUILD THE WALL ALREADY !!!!!
So declare a state of emergency already!
So defend our nation and end the shutdown!
So do it and the hell with the Nancy's. And chucks. Don't buckle , they need to listen to the people.
So do what needs to be done! Without Congress if necessary!
So don‚Äôt say not to the wall and you will have security like Hungary. Support the wall between Mexico and USA.
So far Mr. President, the best idea yet is to freeze the pay of Congress, especially the House.  Pretty sure they will come around and do the "right" thing then...‚Ä¶...ü§î
So glad we have you! Just having things be how they always were, doesnt mean you should keep it that way!!! I am so happy you are IMPROVING our country. I love how so many are loudly against you, and its brushed right off of your shoulder. Keep right with God and we can have a wonderful nation! Thank you from my household. My name is Mercy and I am praying for you!
So happy we are not fighting over what bathrooms are!!!
So happy you are our President! Thank you for protecting Americans!
So has the democrats even suggested anything on what can actually be done to HELP security on  the borders. For some reason haven't heard anything on that
So how many friends *do* you have that are cheating on their spouses Elisabeth Temple?
So it's a wall making the US a nation? Thought that would be true for China....
So let's give the President his Monument, (a statue or obelisk) to his commemoration but NOT a WALL !!
So many triggered people in this thread üòÇüòÇ
So not the welfare of the people but a really tall wall. OK
So pay Border Patrol. You are the one withholding their pay. Disgraceful !
So proud of our Great President. Thank you President Trump for everything you are doing. TRUMP 2020.
So right!
So says the man with bone spurs who never fought for his country
So shut down the people that protect our borders?
So since you want to defend the borders, you‚Äôll drop the plan for a wall that will literally never perform as promised.   We need freedom more than anything else, and you are even more anti-freedom than the last 5 dingbats in chief
So stop making sneaky backdoor deals with Russian oligarchs. #MAGA8645
So the 21,605 people guarding the SWB aren‚Äôt enough?  Asking for a friend!
So the dems want to do 2 things in the short run..1 have open borders and flood the country with new voters and/or 2 eliminate electoral college.  It's the ONLY way they can take back power.  Then they can eliminate guns, raise taxes, take control of major corporations like FB and control the conservatives and christians thru social credits.  They will turn us into a socialist country and wreck it, like Venezuela.  That is where we are heading...
So then why did you conspire with Russia to destroy it?

So true and we are behind you 100%.

So true.  We will be a third world county in 20 years.  Stop them now.  Oh, another caravan, 2000, is on its way.  Democrats just don't get it or it is just because Trump wants it.  Guess what, so do the American people.
So trump is god then? Hmmm

So what are you waiting on
So what do you think a wall will do? People go over, under and around walls. Yet there are no walls at Area 51 and you cannot get within a mile of the border without getting caught by military police! Why? Because they use 21st century surveillance and tactics. We are a 21st century super power, time we start acting like it!
So what have you done for the firat 2 years and 17 days of your administration.  Left the borders unsecure?
So what your saying is your gay
So whats the hold up? You k ow the dems are gonna go along with you. If its an emergency declare one. Stop the talk and take action. We voted for you and a wall. What are you waiting for?
So what‚Äôs your point thick orange skull?  Borders are drawn on maps and you don‚Äôt need a wall to defend them.
So where is the cry for wall with Canada - that they will pay for?!?!?
So why don't the people who voted for Trump, stand up and march on Capital Hill?
So why don't you focus your efforts on shipping point's of entry and planes.  Where the REAL problem is.  Border issues have been declining for decades now.  A wall is not the answer.
So why is CPB working without pay, if they are not defending our border? Thought that's what they do. Resign, putz.
So you are a hypocrite.
So you are going to hold hard working government workers pay hostage to get funding for a wall that has an amazing chance of never being finished
So you lied about Mexico paying for the wall.  You are a fraud.
So you like chess okay. White knight to black rook. Your move marfema auswitz 999 op nation Z initiate peg12go###
So you stopped paying the Coast Guard. Yep. You're smart.
So you support russia and a traitor now. Good luck a-holes.
So you want me to put mo cheese on my burger for wall tax
So you're telling me that after all the bullshit about Obama bringing Sharia Law to America, you'd be okay with Trump declaring martial law over something as pointless as a border wall?
So your a ‚Äúnationalist‚Äù then white guy...

Some Suggest, Shutting Down the Legilatures funding.  Unfortunately Trump signed a bill to fund the Legislature before the shutdown.  Legislators have the power to get things passed even if the President Veto's it.  Regular government workers have no such power.  All Trump asked is that Congress send him a package that includes $5 Billion for a Wall for Our Border Security and he will sign it, and the DEMS refuse.
Some want wall, and I just want for cholesterol to hurry up.
Somebody get him a chill pill.
Somebody gives him money to building the wall. He was the US president who did very well for America great again. Congress gotta trust him instead of selfish as right now.

Sometimes, it's important to stop and think while keeping an open mind until all of the facts are in. The recent attack in Syria was definitely a horrible tragedy and we have to get these attacks to stop once and for all, but if you think about it, you had just announced that the American Troops would be pulling out of Syria, so why would ISIS attack at that point rather then waiting for the complete withdrawal of the Troops?  ISIS obviously wants America out of Syria because they're not doing very well with us there, so, why would they risk an attack that might lead to the American Troops staying in Syria for longer then necessary. Now, if the Rebels were afraid of losing the assistance of the American Troops they would have to find a way of keeping the Troops in Syria. It would seem that ISIS would tend to reappear once the American Troops have left Syria and that's something that will probably never end and will always pose a threat, especially now in the age of the internet and Social Media. ISIS and other Terrorist Groups will never be completely obliterated and that's why it's so important to put a stop to Terrorism altogether and it must start from within and become law throughout all of the Countries within the Middle East. The Leaders of the Middle East must work together to come up with a plan to stand together and battle Terrorism until it can be ended once and for all. There are ways of controlling Terrorism and it often has to do with effecting the things that they Love and Cherish the most. After all, that's what Terrorism is all about, destroying the things that we Love and Care about the most. One day Terrorism will be eroded from the face of the Earth but it's going to take every Country, around the World, to do their part and work together to protect each other and end Terrorism forever.

Sophie Tkacz Wildrick I've held the same  before this joke of a human being was ever in office.  He contradicts himself.  And oh honey my last name doesn't make me,  get that straight.  My mom is as white as you are sooooooooooooo
Sophie Tkacz Wildrick Some people just don't know what is good for them....and have to be saved from themselves!
Sophie Tkacz Wildrick name one thing he's done that's helped this country and tell me how it's actually helped this country.
Sophie Tkacz Wildrick no. Thanks to Obama for turning things around a few years ago. Trump hasn't done anything and shutting the government down for almost 30 days ain't no better.
Sophie Tkacz Wildrick üòÇ Holy Jesus I needed that belly laugh. Donald Trump was born into wealth. His first car was a limousine. He hasn‚Äôt wiped his own ass in decades. His handlers do it for him. What‚Äôs tragic though is you admire and worship  him. He‚Äôs nothing more than a two bit thief. He will go down in history as the most corrupt person to ever occupy the oval office. Live with that Sophie dear

Source? Maybe among Republicans but no polls show even a majority among the general population.
South Korean News rumor is that President Trump will meet with North Korean Kim Jong Eun and negotiate for ICBM and disarmament, not C V I D.  If rumors are true, American and global citizens are disappointed with President Trump.
South Korean News rumor is that President Trump will meet with North Korean Kim Jong Eun and negotiate for ICBM and disarmament, not C V I D.  If rumors are true, American and global citizens are disappointed with President Trump. When Kim Jong - eun meets with North Korea and the disarmament negotiations with the ICBM take place, Americans do not trust Trump. Do not forget it.
Spaseeba, comrade!
Speaking of defense-Trump‚Äôs choice of lawyers was bad. He would have been better off with Frito Pendejo.,

She needs to stay home and create a budget that includes the wall. Hopefully, we stay shut down long enough for you to get rid of 1000s of federal employees. Downsizing the government would be wonderful. #MAGA #pelosischumershutdown

Step 3 - Crumble as a nation under the most idiotic leadership in history
Step one - secure the borders. Step two - vote out the Democrats
Stephen DeVoy - I travel a lot, but I don't go to any other country, because I live in the best country in the world and there is so much to see and do in our Republic.
Stephen DeVoy and you are so democrat
Stephen DeVoy give me one country , one single country that allows illegal entry to its territories ... when I lived in Copenhagen I would take the train to malmo Sweden twice a week for Work , and do you know how many check points there were ? One before boarding the train , another one ON the train and one last upon arrival ... you should always have your passport on you ... I believe it is YOU who have never traveled so zip it !
Stephen DeVoy please mention one
Stephen DeVoy yea look at Europe right now. They are being raped pillaged and burned and the police do nothing. Open borders must be working. Not!   Right now common people are rejecting this idea. Common folks have donned yellow vest in France and fighting to take back France. So there‚Äôs hope folks!
Stephen Lee I think the air lines should pay TSA
Stephen Pierson  U R A F*ING Communist!
Stephen Pierson He doesn't bless traitors with potty mouths either.
Stephen Pierson I m an immigrant, a legal one that is! ‚úåüèª
Stephen Pierson Thats a lie FAKE POLLS
Stephen Pierson how do you know the majority? Did we take it to a vote? ..... oh that's right..... we did.... we elected a president who put that as his campaign promise.... I see both sides and have friends in both sides.
Stephen Pierson my daughter is 2. Nice one creep.
Stephen Pierson praying for you!
Stephen Pierson really? #MAGA2020 hating the person responsible for actually doing things to strengthen our country, our economy,  our standing in the world that loser 44 flushed down the toilet. He is still #BestPresidentInYourLifeTime
Stephen Pierson thanks for upholding the very low standard of discourse you Leftists are noted for. P.S. I noted you have no photos on your page. Why not ? üòâ
Stephen Pierson, based on your fb and all the trump on it, you need help. Like it or not, hes your president and hes doing a damn good job. No president is perfect, but one that genuinely cares about America is a nice change of pace!
Steve Deshner Mexico will be paying when the illegals can no longer send American dollars back to Mexico to spend. And we no longer have to pay for illegals medical, food, and housing.
Steve Deshner When the Dems approved the wall for the same reasons Trump wants the wall how did they plan to pay for it!!? Maybe you ought to check out facts and you'll get a surprise if you didn't already know!! The Dems not only approved the wall they set aside money for it and spent just a little bit of it to put some wall there. They stole the rest of the money, where did they spend it, to other country's!!!!? Mexico paying or not no longer should be an issue, not just Trump but millions of Americans want the wall also.Those that don't just happen to be us that don't want to support something's you do. There is up to 2,000 more illegal Aliens heading our way, in groups of 500 !! Their not all coming from South America, some China and Muslim country's!! Yep shocker all going to the US southern border!!
Steve Imbresci I'd be willing to test that theory
Steve Imbresci what happen to "the best negotiator" "no one better"?
Steve Zadorozniak maybe you‚Äôre suffering from cognitive dissonance and leftist mental disorder
Steven Brickhouse You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress. Can you think of a reason he didn‚Äôt do it when he could?
Stfu

Stick a fork in him?
Stick to your guns...let everyone know where NANCY IS...
Still making America great,2020
Still not  sure why the border is such a crisis right now!  Why wasn't something done during the 2 years you controlled both houses?!?   Something is not right here....   OH!   I know what it is!  You're using federal employees as pawns in a political game!   I know you care NOTHING about those citizens not getting paid because how many times have you done this in years and decades past?!?    Well done 45, running this country like your businesses... Into the ground that it!     #FailedPresident #CaresNotAboutCitizens

Shame on our government all of you for putting America families at risk, that is not making America great again. Do your damn job, build your stupid wall, won't make a damn difference. Planes, boats and tunnels, please.

Stop paying senators and congressmen and this will end
Stop saying the Dems don't want border security. It's a lie. They want EVERYTHING, including sections of wall where needed, except a useless waste of money from SD to Brownsville. And, please, Trump fans, read/listen to something else besides POtuS, Faux, etc. THEY ARE NOT TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. YOU LIVE IN A FANTASY WORLD.
Stop talking about it use your power president
Stop the bull Trump Stop the lies.  Your corrupt crap is overflowing
Stop the salaries of Congress and Senate.  Let's see how fast they come up with a wall and budget.

Susan Casto He can't force Mexico to pay for it. Unfortunate,if he choose to stop the annual welfare this Country gives to Mexico,the liberals would melt down! They would block his attempts to stop the money given to Mexico,everyone knows this. But,if he stops even a small percent ofthe illegal  entries, the wall would pay for itself with nothing more then the costs we absorb per entry.
Susan Close You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress. Can you think of a reason he didn‚Äôt do it when he could?

Susan Dowd Donny is sealing his fate as a one-term president!  Bwahahahahaha!!  Talk about obvious statements...EVERYONE agrees we need border security.  What we don‚Äôt need is his cost-ineffective wall.  Donny needs to agree to the bipartisan deal already passed by Congress so his shutdown does not completely destroy our economy.  Just give it up now and reopen our government!!!

Susan Dowd Susan no high horse here. Nancy won‚Äôt negotiate. Complain to her. Not our president. They all will be paid for doing nothing. Apply for unemployment, food stamps etc. they give these things to illegals they can give to deserving Americans.
Susan Dowd that is how they did it for 35 years and nothing got done after the fact. Not this time.
Susan Dowd you realize Obama did it to force unconditional Health Care that is failed and fund illegal in Texas, but your OK with that?
Susan Fischer christ, you must be a barrel of fun on a date

Kinda makes it look like its a bunch of made up BS created by right-wing talking pundits like Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh to whip you mindless people into shape. You should not listen to those folks, they are steering you wrong.
Susan Scarberry, FACT‚ùóÔ∏èObama is NO LONGER IN OFFICE. Try to keep up!  You can't deflect from the deep, deep trouble the man CURRENTLY in the White House finds himself. Scandal after scandal. The name RUSSIA seems to pop up often. WHY?   If President Obama was such a hardened criminal why has the ONLY issue connected to him was paying a fine for errors in campaign records? Not ONE indictment, not ONE conviction and NO ONE from his administration went to prison. Oops!

THE trump SHUTSHOW 3.0, Day 27: Can you say ‚Äúpay for play‚Äù ? T-Mobile announced a merger needing Trump administration approval. The next day, 9 executives had reservations at Trump‚Äôs hotel. ‚ÄúLast April, telecom giant T-Mobile announced a megadeal: a $26 billion merger with rival Sprint, which would more than double T-Mobile‚Äôs value and give it a huge new chunk of the cellphone market. But for T-Mobile, one hurdle remained: Its deal needed approval from the Trump administration. The next day, in Washington, staffers at the Trump International Hotel were handed a list of incoming ‚ÄúVIP Arrivals.‚Äù That day‚Äôs list included nine of T-Mobile‚Äôs top executives ‚Äî including its chief operating officer, chief technology officer, chief strategy officer and chief financial officer, and its outspoken celebrity chief executive, John Legere. The executives had scheduled stays of up to three days. But it was not their last visit. Instead, T-Mobile executives have returned to President Trump‚Äôs hotel repeatedly since then, according to eyewitnesses and hotel documents obtained by The Washington Post.‚Äù  FULL STORY BELOW https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-place-i-feel-very-comfortable-t-mobile-executives-seeking-government-approval-for-merger-stayed-at-trumps-hotel-repeatedly/2019/01/15/6a114d3e-142c-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html?utm_term=.af9acc540cbcT-Mobile announced a merger needing Trump administration approval.

TRUMP IS, "INDIVIDUAL 1" and implicated in 2 felonies in court documents. BEWARE the Trump Low life cheesy lying UnAMERICAN crime family.  MORE MANAFORT INFORMATION WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL. Michael Cohan has set date to testify in congress in open session. üòÇ Grab your popcorn, Walnuts üòÇ  Trump has been being investigated since before inauguration by the counterintelligence division of the FBI (ongoing).  Allen Weisselberg and David Pecker have given up all they know including videotapes and documents about all his filthy dirty dealings.

Taking a quick break from the lies and exaggerations about the border situ, let‚Äôs take a Check In on the other lie about Coal Country.  These facts are startling: https://youtu.be/KRKIqTmmhcA
Talk to the border agents -- they will tell you what they need and they said they need the barrier.
Tasha Dawn there is no proof of that. There is proof, however, that Russia meddled in our election. All intelligence committees agree as well as the Senate.
Tax cuts for billionaires were more urgent.
Tax returns as promised.

Thank you Trump for protecting us when the democrats refuse to care about anyone but the illegal immigrants coming into our country and raping and killing our people. Nancy even hid behind a wall when the Angel mom's came to visit her to talk about the illegal immigrants killing their children. She wants to hide and not let the media see how awful she's being while you are trying to make this country safe again.
Thank you Trump for stepping up to the plate and fighting for us.  God bless you
Thank you for doing your job right for the American people!
Thank you for fighting for our country.
Thank you for fighting so hard for Americans! Most would have given up by now. Praying for you and your family!
Thank you for leaving our borders at our coastlines and airports unsecured. Now we have open borders. If you thought that a wall would stop any threats, then you're a stupid Son of butch and you need to be FIRED!!! Because now with the shutdown, you have left our borders completely opened.

Thanks for standing up for the American people Mr. President Trump!
Thanks for taking your job seriously.  Everyday it becomes more apparent that we need your strong leadership.
Thanks to trumps inexperienced and foolish arrogance, or enemies now have enthusiasm, and not a mention from the president about the 4 American hero‚Äôs that lost their life‚Äôs while defending this country! All I see is people defending their egos, while they brag about being the last ones to abandon trumps sinking ship! What pathetic display of foolishness! You guys should be ashamed
Thanks.
Thanx for playing whatabout.
That Beto sign by your pic proves your a fuckin NIM ROD ! üá®üá±
That camera angle does a decent job of hiding Trump's obesity.
That doesn‚Äôt mean a wall.
That goes against the Demonrats. They seem to care more about non citizens.
That is correct. Nations are mainly defined by borders.
That is exactly what the democrats are trying to do.
That is exactly what the democrats want. One world wide nation under their chaotic rule. They are more than happy to throw away US sovereignty if it will accelerate their global citizen goals! Stay strong, win both the house and the senate by to build the wall. MAGA in 2020! If the Brits can escape the EU, you can escape the democrats!
That is his primary duty under the constitution.
That is just a small fraction of the total cost. Trump would have to pitch another tantrum every time the budget comes up for a vote.
That is right! Borders are part of a Country.  It is necessary.
That is the goal. They disrespect our flag and National Anthem. They hate the founding fathers and the Constitution. Why does it surprise you that they want to weaken our borders? It kind of fits a pattern.  Oh and just a reminder. Lock her up. Good day Mr President.
That is the whole point as the elite and super rich want cheap labour that is easy to control and won't stand up and fight back.
That is true..no borders no country anymore
That is what Socialist Democrats want. Open Borders and Globalization.  The elimination of Sovereign Nations. Free flow of people everywhere. Eventually the People ruled by a One World Order.   Obama‚Äôs solution would be Islam Domination. He just loves the Call To Prayer.
That may be your silliest yet, Donald John on repeat.  üòëüôÑ
That money would benefit Americans better with universal healthcare so
That quote applies to Obama. This isn't about the president, it's about American sovereignty, human trafficking, drug trafficking and American lives.
That wall was just a campaign gimmick to remind Trump to talk about immigration at his rallies. He didn't even intend to build a literal wall, but when he tried to back off and say he just meant border security, his base screamed no, we want a real wall. So now he is stuck, being brought down on an issue he didn't even care about.
That was great
That would have been Osama when he held office.
That's Right!!!  #maga!!!
That's Why You're There.. GREAT LEADER.. Don't Trust Any of them Lying DEMO'S. BUILD THAT WALL > MAKE IT HAPPEN.
That's a pretty simple idea unless you have to deal with the Schumer's and Pelosi's of the world. The Dems in today's Congress speak in terms of power mongering, not common sense.Trump is no rocket scientist but even HE can see that border security is needed stat
That's actually true
That's blasphemy.
That's exactly what we miss on the leader of our country's. Mister Donald J. Trump, the German people  need your help.
That's my President
That's not true at all lol..
That's right Mr.President with you all the way I will vote for you again in 2020
That's right let's fight to get mexico to pay for that wall! That's what you promised right?
That's right make Mexico pay for it like you promised. Reduce the deficit, bring back the coal industry.
That's right! And then who will help the world! Love our President and First Lady!!!üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è Our President standing for our country to keep us strong, and then we can continue to help the world. America first so we can, as always, help the world.
That's right!! You said it was a swamp, and it sure us true.  Imagine Pelosi cancels state of union due to security concerns, but will not secure our border. ?ü§îü§î
That's the action figure pose I want. Make it happen!
That's the dumbest damn thing I've read all day. Thanks for the laugh.
That's the question we should be asking our government maybe government of the past... obviously it's future destruction of our dear country.
That's the stupidest thing ever come out his mouth he is a liar
That's their game plan. Why we must never let the foriegniers into our nation.  They do not assimilate, learn our language.  ( Build the wall cheap) Study China's wall. Lesson learned in America about foriegniers, never again. Godless of the devil. Terrorist.   Lord returns 2024,  judgement day. Will America confess the mistake of letting in foriegniers?    What to do now? Build the wall!  Hispanics call themselves, La Raza! The Race!  Huge movement, can be stopped.  Get the  Dems to stop stupidity..  Mexico just elected a socialist. Whatch Mexico go down the tubes. Like Cuba and Venezula.  Then people will flee Mexico just to look for food, like in Venezula.  Mexicans hungry will steal and more. Mexicans will steal from Mexicans, whites , everyone.  Venezuela is seeking Russia help now and looks to go Godless communist. Not very healthy!  I have been to Venezula. People wanted piece of the pie, so voted socialism, never works, has no stock exchange, none , why failed!  Please pray for the wall now! Pray for our president Trump.
That's their whole plan. To make us a Socialist open border UN province.
That's weird. I didn't realize that from 1776 to the present day, we were never really a "nation" because we didn't have a wall all the way around us.  I also didn't realize that no other country on earth is truly a "nation" because none of them have such a wall either.  I'm bored. Guess I'll write down all of your names again.
That's what Germany fails to understand
That's what it should be!!!!
That's what the demorats want!
That's what the radical left wants.
That's why his best friend is our ally, you know, because he cares about our safety and all
That.  Right.  Protect.  Kids. Bad. Men. Like. Emmas. Dad. And. John. Stevenson. Sick. Fathers. Molest. Daughters
Thats true when it comes to every single politicians who were lobbied ergo jews
That‚Äôs a crock of bullshyt!!!! Your killing the American dream!!!!!!! Your very untrustworthy!!!!
That‚Äôs a dead link Cindy. Feel free to try again.
That‚Äôs about the stupidest thing he could say. We‚Äôve been a country for over 200 years. We have always had a southern border and we have been a nation for all of that time. Where does he come up with things like this?
That‚Äôs interesting because Brazil just voted in Bolsonaro as President, a man nicknamed ‚ÄúBrazil‚Äôs Trump.‚Äù  You gotta be pretty damn dumb to think ‚Äúthe whole world is laughing at Trump.‚Äù
That‚Äôs interesting we‚Äôve existed for over 200 years till you came along.
That‚Äôs right
That‚Äôs right no border no nation (Rats)
That‚Äôs right you lock your doors ....don‚Äôt you.....
That‚Äôs the facts jak.
That‚Äôs the most freaking photo shopped image of you I‚Äôve ever seen. His gut and frazzled hair just went away.
That‚Äôs the reason why we voted for you,because of your Patriotic spirit of loyalty to our Country ,and braveness to defend‚Äôt,for all of that Thank you Mr President and people on your side. Blessings to all .we love America.
That‚Äôs true
That‚Äôs true actually. Surprised how it‚Äôs turning out
That‚Äôs what democrat leadership wants.
That‚Äôs what the Democrats want. That‚Äôs why the people put you in office.
That‚Äôs what the democrats are trying to accomplish
That‚Äôs what the left and the UN want! The US not to exist anymore! They are the enemy and need to be treated as such
That‚Äôs why DOD employees are still working and getting paid. The Coast Guard is not DOD‚Äîbut Dept. of Commerce.
The  best
The  real  enemy  is  within. Trust  me.
The "Nation State" cannot be taken lightly. Main worry for Brexit and the British Government is "the falling apart of the United Kingdom". We already heard lots of Brits politicians talking about "the Scottish Nation".. "The Welsh..the Irish.. do not accept this".
The American people say thank you for putting our safety first. Best President ever.
The Art of the Deal: You pout and cry until you get what you want.
The Border Is Pretty Safe Border cities get a bad rap as violent, but the Rio Grande Valley is extremely safe. Of the 24 Texas metro areas ranked by the FBI, Brownsville comes in dead last, with 240 incidents of violent crime per 100,000 people. Nearby McAllen comes in at #18, with 286 per 100,000.  Things are closer to the middle of the pack in El Paso and Laredo, which place at #13 and #10, respectively. The murder rate in each city is low, at 1.4 and 1.5 (Brownsville also comes in at 1.4, which is the second-lowest behind Abilene at 0.6). The numbers in El Paso, Laredo, and McAllen are all slanted heavily toward aggravated assault. In Brownsville, meanwhile, though the overall numbers for everything are very low, robbery crimes make up a surprisingly high number of cases, at 58.1 per 100,000, good for almost 25% of the violent crime in the city.  The Parts Of South Texas North Of The Border Are Somewhat Less So Corpus Christi, Victoria, and San Antonio all place within the top 10 on the list (at #7, 8, and 9, respectively). The numbers for all three cities are pretty similar‚Äîalthough Victoria, like Amarillo, has a surprisingly high number of reported rape cases, at 71.5 per 100,000. The average for all Texas cities listed is 36, which means that, again‚Äîeither Victoria (and Amarillo) have more than twice as many rapes occurring than the rest of the state, or they‚Äôre being reported more frequently in those cities than elsewhere.  That statistic aside, there‚Äôs not a lot to parse about those numbers: Corpus has the highest murder rate, at 5.4, of the three, while San Antonio has a lower robbery rate than the other largest metro areas in Texas, Houston and Dallas.
The Canadian border is open because it's okay so far.  The Mexican border is far from safe and needs to be walled!!!
The Coast Guard, you know the ones who STOP all the drugs he's got you upset about....They are NOT. The welders who fix their boats? ARE NOT.  TSA, who actually stop the terrorists...are NOT. He has sacrificed EVERY US border to get a political win. Screw him and his support for it.  Don't tell me this is about border security. It's about trump's tiny penis size and slipping popularity and impending indictments.
The Da Fence of our nation!
The Democratic Party  Created The KKK.  Klan violence worked to suppress black voting, and campaign seasons were deadly. More than 2,000 people were killed, wounded, or otherwise injured in Louisiana within a few weeks prior to the Presidential election of November 1868. Although St. Landry Parish had a registered Republican majority of 1,071, after the murders, no Republicans voted in the fall elections. White Democrats cast the full vote of the parish for President Grant's opponent. The KKK killed and wounded more than 200 black Republicans, hunting and chasing them through the woods. Thirteen captives were taken from jail and shot; a half-buried pile of 25 bodies was found in the woods. The KKK made people vote Democratic and gave them certificates of the fact.[67]
The Democratic Party of SLAVES...   The Federalist Party and the Democratic Party were united in their goal of building up the United States by conquest and genocide. Both agreed that the U.S. would come to rule the continent of North America by taking land from Mexico and from the Native Americans. They wanted the state to use the army to clear new territories for expansion. The Democratic Party candidate Andrew Jackson was elected in 1828. His first action was to support the ‚ÄúIndian Removal Act‚Äù which was passed in 1830. Under Jackson and the next Democratic Party President, Martin Van Buren, 70,000 Indians east of the Mississippi were terrorized and driven out of their lands by the military. In 1845 Democratic Party President James Polk took the United States into a war with Mexico to acquire the territory from Texas to California. That summer, in a leading Democratic political magazine, the editor John O‚ÄôSullivan proclaimed that it was the U.S.‚Äôs ‚Äúmanifest destiny to overspread the continent‚Ä¶‚Äù In other words, it is the so-called God-given right of the United States to dominate the continent of North America by force.
The Democrats are heartless. Nancy Pelosi wouldn't meet with the Angel moms and dads. That goes to show she doesn't care a wit about American citizens, only illegal immigrants. That is what our country has come to, unfortunately.
The Dems are playing reverse psychology , ppl will now have empathy and compassion for immigrants looking for a better life; especially, for children walking for weeks, without food. SMH, President Trump's fell right into that trap. Ppl have been without a paycheck, and becoming scared; imagine not being able to support your family for years..
The Dems do not want to call the wall, "wall".  Compromise then, will call it 'BUILD the WIDGET"
The Dems don‚Äôt want us to be a Strong Nation,, they want Communist rule!!
The Dems opposing him need to be rounded imprisoned and/or executed.  They are treasonous and it's time to put an end to them.
The Dim Rats are so stubborn like children !!!!!! Go Trump !!!!!!
The Election of Trump has pulled the curtain back on The Administrative State (deep state) ...Greatly points to the fact that we don't have a "Justice" system. We have a "Just Us" system (designed to protect criminals like the clintons). I no longer trust any of the alphabet Law Enforcement Agencies including the IRS or the Courts. The whole thing is rigged and corrupt beyond repair. Everybody knows this.  .Democrats are now an adversary of the U.S. and like any enemy of the U.S. they care nothing about National Security and Public Safety..
The Emoluments Clause, US Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 ‚ÄúAlso known as the Title of Nobility Clause, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution prohibits any person holding a government office from accepting any present, emolument, office, or title from any "King, Prince, or foreign State," without congressional consent. This clause is meant to prevent external influence and corruption of American officers by foreign States. A similar provision was included in the Articles of Confederation, applicable to both federal and state officers. The language of the modern clause, however, suggests that only federal government officials are prohibited from accepting any emoluments. That the phrase "Offices of Profit or Trust under the United States" applies to all appointed officials is undisputed, however there is much debate as to whether it extends to elected officials. History does not provide a clear answer: When he served as Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton produced a list of persons holding such offices at the request of the Senate; the list did not include any elected positions. Further, during their presidencies, while George Washington did not seek or obtain congressional consent for foreign gifts, Andrew Jackson did. The Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act of 1966, on the other hand, enumerates several elected positions in its definition of "employees" who may not accept any gift of more than minimal value without congressional approval. Such "employees" include the President and the Vice President, a Member of Congress, and the spouses and dependents of the same. A constitutional amendment was introduced in 1810 to modify the Emoluments Clause. The effect would have been to strip the citizenship of any U.S. citizen who accepted, claimed, received, or retained any title of nobility from a foreign government. However, this amendment was never ratified, though it is technically still pending before the states. The interpretation of the Emoluments Clause has never been litigated before the U.S. Supreme Court.‚Äù https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/emoluments_clause
The Federal Government does not care about their citizens.
The House overwhelmingly passes resolution disapproving of Russia sanctions relief, 362-53, a symbolic rebuke of Trump admin decision.  There were 136 Republicans who supported the measure and 53 opposed--And just to be clear: This won't stop the sanctions from being lifted because the measure failed in the Senate

The Republican party as a whole and it saddens me that some African Americans support this.  "What you really need to do is go back in the ‚Äô30s, when they outlawed all types of drugs in Kansas (and) across the United States. What was the reason why they did that? One of the reasons why, I hate to say it, was that the African Americans, they were basically users and they basically responded the worst off to those drugs just because of their character makeup, their genetics, and that.  Alford‚Äôs comments referenced a belief promoted by marijuana prohibitionist Harry Anslinger, the founding commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.  ‚ÄúUnder Anslinger‚Äôs leadership, the FBN came to be considered responsible for the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937,‚Äù the report noted, ‚Äúregulating cannabis and further taxing it to the ultimate detriment of the hemp industry that was booming at the time.‚Äù  ‚ÄúReefer makes darkies think they‚Äôre as good as white men,‚Äù Anslinger said once when explaining why marijuana supposedly caused crime and violence.

The Secure Fence Act of 2006 The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico. The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. At the time the act was being considered, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer were all members of the Senate. Obama, Clinton, Schumer and 23 other Democratic senators voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19

DeMario, very much, for your email. Your human and compassionate touch is reassuring.  I am the victim‚Äôs blood Uncle, not her father.  The PBPD are not investigating a homicide, either by MCCAULEY or anyone else‚Äì and as a man of your background and experience can plainly see ‚Äì a homicide was committed.   The PBPD has already proven their lack of worth by not complying with the new Florida Law related to opiate deaths recently signed by Gov. Scott. JFK found opiates in Nia‚Äôs system. She may have been a high functioning alcoholic; but, Nia did not abuse or even use opiates to our knowledge.  She had recently started a new clerical job for an older couple who attend her church here in West Palm. (Nia worked for the WV Governor‚Äôs Office before moving to WBP about 8 years ago) She passed a drug test less than 2 months ago for her new employer; and was soon to qualify for medical benefits.  My brother, I, and the rest of my family including retired FL State Parole/Probation Officer-Investigator Eric. P. Ankner; Nia‚Äôs other blood Uncle; formally request any investigation into the death of NIA LEE ANKNER be transferred to the PBSO.  The trust between the surviving Ankner Family and the PBPD has been irremediably broken; and we will have extreme difficulty working with them to a truthful, complete, and just conclusion.  However thankfully, our faith and trust in the PBSO remains intact. We also formally request an investigation into the PBPD‚Äôs handling of their investigation into Nia‚Äôs death up to this point ‚Äì particularly for dereliction of duty, suppression of evidence, and obstruction of justice. If such an investigation is not within your Jurisdiction; please advise us of who‚Äôs it is.  Please, assume the investigation of NIA LEE ANKNER‚Äôs homicide.  Sincerely and Respectfully,  From: Demario, Frank [mailto:DeMarioF@pbso.org]  Sent: 08/25/2017 1:42 PM  To: Charles Ankner <charles@saintbrandcannabis.com>  Cc: kblouin@palmbeachpolice.com  Subject: RE: Investigation of Homicide of NIA LEE ANKNER in Town of Palm Beach on Aug 5th, 2017  Mr. Ankner,  I‚Äôm sorry for your loss and your frustration with the investigation of your daughter‚Äôs death.  As you know this investigation falls within the jurisdiction of the Palm Beach Police Department and I can assure you they have the ability and expertise to properly investigate her death.  Judging by your letter it appears you are familiar with the law and should understand that toxicology is a vital part of a death investigation and takes a considerable amount of time to receive the results and the ME makes the final determination of the crime classification.  I believe all your questions and requests will be answered by the PBPD investigator, in due time.  To conclude, I see no reason to request, assist or join the investigation that the PBPD is conducting at this time.

Director Blouin, Officers,  Forgive me for causing your Department further trouble; however, I must voice my and my family‚Äôs extreme displeasure, if I dare say our disgust, regarding your handing of the death investigation, and your communication with the surviving family, of NIA LEE ANKNER.  What your responding Officers knew and were told by your own Department‚Äôs Emergency Medical Responders regarding Nia‚Äôs condition ‚Äì blue to black skin color, pin-point pupils, no respiration, etc‚Ä¶ indicated severe opiate poisoning; and yet, you/they let the repeat felony probation/parolee offender, prime material witness, who accompanied Nia, and most probably poisoned her‚Ä¶to walk away.  For the most part, your Department ignored information being provided by the victim‚Äôs family at the scene. Amazing‚Ä¶  KELLY A. MCCAULEY was not searched, not questioned at length ‚Äì nothing ‚Äì a repeat violent offender present during a very suspicious death ‚Äì and you let her walk away. And then you had the victim‚Äôs family drive the crime scene vehicle back to the victim‚Äôs home, and the victim‚Äôs father to drive the prime witness / suspect to her home!?     As you know, Florida Law now requires homicide investigations related to opiate and other Class 1 Controlled Substance related deaths.   Forgive my USAF parlance; but, you‚Äôve ‚Äúscrewed the pooch‚Äù from the arrival on scene up until now.  Your Department also kept communicating to my brother days on end as his daughter lay brain dead in a hospital - ‚Äúshe was only one mile into our jurisdiction and had just arrived‚Äù, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have homicides in Palm Beach‚Äù, ‚Äúthe drug problem comes from the mainland‚Äù. Should be criminal in an of itself.  Your Department cared more for your convenience and reputation than you did the Constitutional Rights of Nia ‚Äì that being her right to life.  There are many other examples of your Departments‚Äô‚Ä¶ how shall I say‚Ä¶ ineptness, dereliction of duty, suppression of evidence, and obstruction of justice ‚Äì which will come to light and be proven in due course.  Please retain, or surrender to the PBSO, all evidence you have and other reports related to your investigation of Nia‚Äôs death. We will have our Atty‚Äôs and investigators contact your and those Offices for that purpose shortly.  Detective Larry Menitti verbally told the victim‚Äôs father George nine days after Nia‚Äôs brain-death while collecting her cell-phone as evidence, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt Mayberry RFB you know. We‚Äôll get to the truth of your daughter‚Äôs death.‚Äù  Well, we beg to differ Sherriff Taylor. And we want you and Barny Fife off the case.

The State of the Union MUST be given; do not let it be delayed!
The US has been a laughing stock Trump is trying to fix it.  He is the first President  that isn't a puppet to all the bureaucrats.
The US-Canada border is 5,525 miles long and it receives less resources and fewer border agents than the US-Mexico border (which is 1,954 miles.) The number of illegal border crossings along the US-Canada border has increased by 142% in just one year. Fenatyl, Marijuana, Ecstacy and coke are the most common drugs smuggled into our country from Canada. It also serves as an easy entrance for terrorists to enter into the US. Border agents along the US-Canada border have made statements about how easy it is for human trafficking and drug smuggling to slip through, due to the lack of man power and resources. Thousands of traffickers and smugglers illegally cross, completely unnoticed by border security and drawing all of our attention on the Southern border only makes it easier for them to do so. The Northern border is currently a bigger threat to us than the Southern border, so why is it we choose not to pay attention?
The USCG and CBP defend our borders quite satisfactorily, thank you very much.  Get them back to work.

The amount of money we spend on illeagal immigrants,could definitely be spent to improve our Country! We can agree on something......
The ball is in your court Mr. President.   The shutdown is a good thing. It shrinks government & it gets rid of wasteful spending  The first thing we need out of this is better security, particularly at the southern border. Our founders envisioned a free market night watchman state, not the bungled bloated bureaucracy our government has become. But we have to keep the uniformed officers paid, which is an emergency. Ideally, continue a resolution to pay the essential employees only, if they are truly working on national security. Furloughed employees should find other work, never return and not be paid.  Secondly, we need savings for taxpayers. If this fight is merely rhetorical bickering with Nancy Pelosi, we all lose, especially the president. But if it proves that government is better when smaller, focusing only on essential functions that serve Americans, then President Trump will achieve something great that Reagan was only bold enough to dream.  The president‚Äôs instincts are right. Most Americans will not miss non-essential government functions. A referendum to end government plunder must happen. Wasteful government agencies are fighting for relevance but they will lose. Now is the time to deliver historic change by cutting them down forever.

The best one ‚òùÔ∏è
The best president ever . In my lifetime I had never seen any another president who had been working so hard for Americans like president Trump  .  I definitely will vote for him again in 2020 !
The best president,keep being determined the way you are the previous ones didn't do anything for the people of America.
The best solution to deport so-called illegal immigrants would be ceasing to be No.1 in the world.
The best way to end this shutdown is for TSA to go on a nationwide strike tomorrow morning so Congress cannot leave and millions of Americans get severely inconvenienced. Since the GOP cannot empathize with the common working person, pain is what they must experience.
The biggest attack we have ever had came through the airports which are unprotected with this shutdown.
The border has a barrier on 60% already, 100% along CA border. The real biggest problem for immigration so folks that overstay visas. Border patrol is being corrupted because drugs and gangs come in through legal checkpoints in vans and trucks and cars. We need staff and technology to counter this. Drinking the Copland and thinking there is no border security now and Trump is the only one who has ever addressed the issue, well like so much of what his followers beleive...that is a lie and foolish.
The border is not the problem it's you allowing all these radical mu@_#__s in this country. there the ones going to hurt the American people.
The border patrols are with the democratic party. We do not need a wall. New radio power will take care of it. See what is happen down under.  Let us take care of the caged children.
The borders ARE secure. We spend billions every year to make sure of that. Good luck with that.
The borders has been the same for as long as I've been alive and we have never ceased to be a nation.  Trump, you're getting more and more stupid every day.  I can't wait till your ass is out of office.
The calling of names is disgusting, immature and non-productive.  some of you people need to seriously grow up.
The caravan came across many borders they were all open any more drugs and terrorist come in from Canada than southern and on plains and by sea
The citizens of the United States is your main priority not your wall that won't stop any one your a fucking joke

The congress has refused to address immigration for years - that s why we have daca. Congress get to the table and do your jobs If we dont have borders we will cease to be a country. Build our wall
The countries that DO have open borders have nothing to lose.
The days of " give us your tired and weary " are over.  Sorry. Try getting into Switzerland.
The defences of the Constitution should be your highest priority.
The defense of our nation is top priority!!!
The democratic stance against secured borders indicates that they are involved in drug and human trafficking.
The democrats are no longer Americans.  They are the socialist party now that wants nothing good or safe for our country.  Declare a National Emergency at the border President Trump and continue building the people's wall.  Thank you.
The democrats dont understand this even though Homeland Security and top border personal have stated publically we need a fricken wall including Obama's formal top border agent but this is too confusing for the democrats to grasp.
The dems want open borders for exactly that reason.
The drug lords are lobbying against the wall
The end is near prisoner Trump!

The fact that demorats hate you more than they love the american people says volumes.  Ill never vote demorat as long as i breathe but once im dead im sure to vote democrat!
The fact that you don‚Äôt pay Giuliani is no excuse for letting him lie in your name every time the senile old bastid opens his big fat facial anus.

Tonight, Rudely admitted that ‚Äúthe collusion in your campaign happened a long time ago.‚Äù REALLY?? Like about 3 years ago?? LMAO!  Then, senile Uncle Rudely with the big mouth said, referring to Robert Mueller, ‚ÄúPut up or shut up!‚Äù Bwaaaahahahaha! Oh he will Rudely! Oh he will!  You‚Äôre going down hard Fatboy Fuhrer. So are your little Nazi mutants, and 1/2 your gestapo KKKabinett! What a shitshow this is gonna be. The whole world is watching you fucKKK it all up! Happy now?
The fact that you have a shut down over a crazy stupid wall that will do nothing to stop illegal immigrants means you are extremely unqualified to be president and you being president is a crime against humanity.
The fighter and the winner....more strength I pray
The freshman congresswoman said Wednesday the shutdown was not really about Trump‚Äôs demands for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border or ‚Äúthe well-being of everyday Americans.‚Äù Instead, she said, it was ‚Äúabout the erosion of American democracy and the subversion of our most basic governmental norms.‚Äù  ‚ÄùIt is not normal to hold 800,000 workers‚Äô paychecks hostage. It is not normal to shut down the government when we don‚Äôt get what we want. It is not normal for public servants to run away and hide from the public that they serve,‚Äù Ocasio-Cortez added. ‚ÄúAnd it is certainly not normal to starve the people we serve for a proposal that is wildly unpopular among the American people! https://news.yahoo.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-torches-trump-114238067.html

The group, consisting of 247 people, turned itself in to authorities near the Antelope Wells Port of Entry just after midnight on Wednesday, January 16, 2019.

The only people in America who have a brain and heart is those who loathe everything your trump stands for and supports: The promotion and propagation of bigotry, hate, ignorance, fear, divisiveness, violence, and fascism.
The only people that shouldn't receive a check during a Government shutdown is; members of Congress, President, Vice President, and the pensions of these retirees. They are responsible and can rectify the situation. No other Government agencies are involved.
The only problem with that is the rest of the Illuminati Legislature in the Senate and Congress does not agree and promotes open border instead so they can pull the New World Order down over our eyes.  "Trump has went against the Illuminati", and therefore is about the only one left with any common sense and US Patriotism.
The only reason Trump promised a wall was to get the votes of the uneducated,  which he said he loves.  Then hecame up with the idea to say Mexico would pay for it,  to get not only the uneducated votes,  but votes of people who did not want our government to pay for it.  Trump knew he could not accomplish this wall all along. Didn't really do anything about it while the republicans had the house and Senate.  Now that the democrats have the house,  he is making a big deal out of it. This way,  he will blame the democrats when it doesn't get built. But he did say he was proud to shut down the government.
The only thing Pelosi does good is Clicking her eyelashes when she talk. Another thing, she has so much botax that she looks Surprise when she talks. It is sick to see her on tv.
The only thing he should hang for is treason.
The only thing she‚Äôs trying to defend is her ego.  Putin says jump and little Donny boy  jumps.
The only things Trump and his base preach is hate and division on a daily basis, never ends.
The only wall America needs is between church and state.
The orange cancer is a disgrace to the office Putin put him in , he's a failed estate agent putting America back 60 years
The people are with you President Trump go keep going you're doing a great job
The people want the wall.  Rasmussen Poll 1/14/19.  53% of Americans want the wall.  39% don‚Äôt.

The politicians holding our money and country hostage make me sick. This is why nothing gets done in our government,because they want to play party politics,instead of doing their job.
The power grab has been made. Be ready for defense of your family and nation. God be with us all.
The prefect metaphor for Trump supporters is a person who finds a piece of garbage on the ground and thinks it's a $100 bill. When you point it out the the person, that it's, actually, trash; instead of throwing the garbage away and saying, "thanks, " They point to another piece of garbage and SCREAM at you, "WHAT ABOUT THAT TRASH, THOUGH?!  THAT'S GARBAGE, TOO RIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT TRASH"  Sure - but I'm talking about the piece of garbage in your hand, that, still, isn't a $100 bill.
The president should hold the state of the union message and have a tv monitor directly behind him on his left or his right and during his union message ask why the democrats called it a crisis then when he used their word crisis they say there is no crisis. He should play past tapes of shumer and pelosi and Clinton and Obama all saying we need a wall to stop illegals and that way the entire nation can see what he is up against ! He can use it to his advantage - use the media towards his advantage ! And make sure the networks do not give democrats after the union message air time !   Roll those past tapes! Remind the American people what liars they are!!!
The president's current shutdown and tweets about immigrants and our safety are intended to frighten us and bully Congress into funding a border wall. Whether a future wall is a good idea or not is questionable, and the whole situation needs discussion and debate. Ironically, the shutdown is causing real danger and harm right now.  Federal workers, who actually serve the country, are sent home without pay, and now know they will have no raise next year. This occurs while our billionaire president and other well-to-do politicians posture and blame in comfort.  Civil servants, who might help process and care for immigrants at the border, are laid off. This makes the situation more difficult and dangerous for both immigrants and the Border Patrol every day.
The real shame is that Trump AND the Dems are grown ass people and they should be able to sit down as such and work it out without holding thousands of hard working Americans hostage. Stop pointing fingers and do something besides tearing our country in half!!!!
The report released Wednesday by the Center for Migration Studies of New York finds people who overstayed their visas accounted for 62 percent of the newly undocumented, while 38 percent had crossed a border illegally. The study also finds that the undocumented population from Mexico fell by almost 400,000 people in 2017 and that since 2010, the number of undocumented from that country fell by 1.3 million. "We have made tremendous progress since the year 2000 in reducing undocumented immigration into this country,"  "Since more than one half of all US undocumented residents arrive by air, visa-issuing posts have become the real frontline deterrent to undocumented migration," the study concludes. "This report suggests that more attention and resources should be given to that crucial mission of the US Department of State."
The same happens if we don't defend our 2nd amendment sir. You AG nomination is an enemy of the 2nd.
The same holda true with the SECOND AMENDMENT
The same people telling you no to $5.5 billion, are the same people who cant account for $21 TRILLION from 1998-2015. So therefore we, the American people are forced to pay a current debt of $21.9 TRILLION, thanks to their carelessness.  But they claim $5.5 billion for more border security is a waste of tax payers dollars? Someone please explain how these people are not in jail...
The security of our southern border in perspective‚Ä¶. President Trump is asking for 5.7 billion out of an annual budget of 4.407 trillion ‚Ä¶. In other words President Trump is asking for $57 out of an annual budget of $44,070 ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ think about that for a minute. Put that in perspective‚Ä¶. Imagine your wife/husband saying we‚Äôre not going back to work, the kids are not going back to school and no bills are being paid unless you give up the idea of spending $57 to fence in our yard‚Ä¶. This is what Pelosi, Schumer and the democrat obstructionists have halted our government for.
The shutdown is not protecting us. Our President is making our country weaker just to force a bill that could not pass, even with a Republican controlled congress. Turn off Fox.
The shutdown makes no sense. Mayors and city officials who live along the border have said it‚Äôs not needed! This wall is not popular! Reopen the government!
The single most important role of the Government is the protection of its citizens
The skin colour thing is real still in this world ,God come and rest the case.
The soil of Afghanistan is hell for the invaders
The solution is simple.  It should be handled the same way the Obama administration handled Obamacare.  If you refuse to pay for the barrier / wall, you will be fined.  This only seems fair.  'Social justice warriors' claiming to 'defend the high moral ground' can't possibly oppose this equitable solution for all Americans.  Afterall, that would be grossely hypocritical.
The sooner the better.  How is that going I hope well haven‚Äôt heard
The south shall rise again
The southern border of the US of A., does not belong to the NATO alliance and the adjacent four states are more Mexican (1846) than the U.S. of A....
The southern grease fried food was destroying my appendix! I was so glad when Mexicans moved in and opened Mexican Restaurants with those delicious tacos, burritos, chilaquiles and tostadas.
The supporters should pay for the wall just sayin
The thing about radical organizations is, even once you've crushed their holdings, supply chain, and leadership, true believers are still going to attack. It's not like fighting a more mercenary or defensive force, where the soldiers will call it quits when the battle is lost and the money runs out. ISIS will keep attacking people until the last idiot who buys into their dogma is dead. Destroying their infrastructure and holdings just removes their ability to recruit and arm said idiots.
The thing is, people will argue about this, even though that is one of, if not the most important job of ANY president.
The time has come to make being a Democrat illegal. In order to be a political party in America, you should resemble something American. The Democrat party has not resembled anything close to American in 50+ years.
The wall goes against the American Union. Mexico, Canada and America as one state. That's why the left wing are trying to drop the border.
The wall is coming !! MAGA
The wall wasn't that important  2 years  ago when the Republicans were a majority.  Just now so he can fight with the Democrats
The wall will not stop drugs.  Maybe a few on foot.  Some come in at regular ports of entry.  I say stop holding the country hostage for purely political reasons.  Look up Trump on immigration 2012.  He must have needed them to work his hotels.
The wall won't actually help. Everyone wants border security, but the money should be spent on things that will actually work, like more personnel, high tech border surveillance technology, more immigration judges and so on.
The way you‚Äôre running the country, there won‚Äôt be much left to protect
The whole country should go on strike
The witch hunt is over!!....We found her‚Äî It‚Äôs NancyüòÇ.  She thinks she can block the President of the United States from speaking the truth to all Americans in the SOTU...  Nancy , Schumer and all the dems need some common sense....Your job is to protect Americans first... We are the most generous people in the world but this country will collapse if you don‚Äôt protect our people....  Do your job‚Äî we have more caravans headed this way... build the steel barrier!!!!!  You took an oath to protect America first...   üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏. Thank you Mr. President for making a stand... and if you have to, please proceed, this is a national emergency‚Äî The SOTU is a good time to outline the obvious and proceed to uphold your oath...
The worse Terrorist in the History of this country came across the northern border from Canada. Mostly Saudis. They killed more Americans on American soil and destroyed more property than any other foreigners on our soil.
Thebgreat faker.
Then BUild to the Fucking Wall.   Democrats think your a pussy... that you won't      jusdoit
Then RESIGN before you cede all to Putin!
Then Ruth, with all due respect, if you aren't from here STFU, and leave us to our own country,why don't you!!!
Then bypass congress and build the wall.
Then declare a national emergency already we are behind you
Then defend our Country! High tech border security is what we need NOT A WALL! Stop defending Putin over our great institutions and the great men and women that have taken the oath to defend this Country against foreign or domestic threats. For goodness sake open the government!
Then defend than without a wall
Then do something about the illegals who overstay their visas.
Then end the shutdown so our TSA agents can get paid.
Then give my native American ppl our land back
Then let the people who keep us safe back to work
Then maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have conspired with Putin.
Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Then open.the government so the coast guard can get paid
Then passing executive order and build the wall we need it
Then pay TSA agents for protecting our nation's Ports of Entry
Then pay the Department that is responsible for defending those borders!
Then put the government back to work and do your job rather than fear mongering.
Then quit holding the nation hostage. The terrorist trump shutdown is the biggest threat to our safety, but you don't care about that so it's clear Americans safety has nothing to do with this issue. Walls don't work! #ImpeachHim. https://www.usatoday.com/border-wall/story/drug-trafficking-smuggling-cartels-tunnels/559814001/
Then resign you fucking halfwit
Then start paying TSA
Then stop bs'n around and call a national emergency. And while we're at it, what exactly is the vetting plan for Muslims coming to this nation. As I recall, you ran on that topic, not to mention, the detrimental affect Muslims have had in other Western nations -- not to mention the historic abomination they've been to humanity since conception. And what is being done about the visa issue and ending chain migration--and I'm not just talking South American individuals, but from the M.E. and Asia as well? Why are we still in Afghanistan protecting poppies for M.E. human scum?
Then stop doing Putin‚Äôs bidding.
Then stop siding with the NRA to ban stuff Bloomberg does't want The People to have. A rifle behind every blade of grass...
Then stop taking orders from the Russians. Trump is a draft dodging traitor
Then stop the men caravans. You know it‚Äôs the government purge around the world letting men in all these countries. Women are extremely few and a distraction. World terrorism is being planned Globally
Then stop your disastrous TRUMP SHUTDOWN, and do some work, Mr. socalled deal maker.
Then u shold start telling the truth. Almost half this nation believe your lies and turning on the half of the nation. Was that your objective, to divide a nation? U certainly have done that!!!!!!!!!
Then use DOD money ..... oh that would mean Defense contractors can't get their quarterly bonuses.. which in turn hurts your stocks in those Corps...
Then why are 4 Americans dead in Syria. Could it be the weakness you showed Putin by promising to remove troops for him made us seem weak to ISIS. And also the fact you announced to the world that ISIS was defeated they had to prove they were not. Or when you empower hate group causing a 17%^ increase in hate crimes as well as an increase in school shooting. Or maybe not paying border patrol TSA inspectors and coast guard makes us safer. https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-trump-just-made-america-less-safe_us_5888fe22e4b0628ad613ddb2
Then why are selling us out to Russia üá∑üá∫?
Then why are you NOT paying TSA workers, you lying POS?
Then why are you in cahoots with Putin?  Why did you get sanctions lifted from Deripaska?
Then why are you leaving our airports, borders, and seaports undermanned and vulnerable by holding our country hostage.  Terrorists come here mostly by plane. Drug trafficking organizations have also taken to the air. Border Patrol and other law enforcement agents have encountered smugglers using ultralight aircraft to conduct drug drops. Customs and Border Protection data showed that ultralight aircraft may have been used to transport drugs on 534 occasions from 2011 to 2016. Drones have also been used.In recent years, the Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection have started to see small speedboats from Mexico used to smuggle drugs into the United States, particularly in California, in an effort to get around border walls and Border Patrol agents. From 2011 to 2016, border officials said there were 309 known attempts to smuggle drugs across the border using boats; officials said there was no way of knowing how many boats actually reach shore.
Then why are you letting TSA go unpaid?
Then why didn‚Äôt you get your wall the last two years when Republicans controlled the House and Senate? It‚Äôs only an issue now to take attention off the investigation of you- and create chaos as Democrats take over the House
Then why is russia backing Trump?
Then why is the coast guard not being paid...
Then why ruin it?
Then why sell it out to Russia???
Then why talk about leaving NATO?
Then why would you tweet about a trip government officials are planning on taking to afghanistan?  You're such a petty, vindictive man.
Then why, mr President, are You wasting our resources on a silly wall. That money could be better spent elsewhere. There are much more effective ways to secure our border than this boondoggle.
Then you are a hypocrite.
Then you should google and read 10 USC 311. Militia Compositions and Classes...and stop appointing people who swear to uphold the constitution while planning to violate it. Those people are liars and are unfit for office. They deserve no respect.
Then, by what you've said countless times, we haven't been a nation these last couple hundred years...
Then??...Call it a National Emergency,!!  Fund and Build "Our" Wall!! Open the Gov....get back on track!! ... MAGA KAG and Safe!
There are 14 of us from Thailand, #2020TRUMP.
There are eight hundred thousand people suffering for not getting paid for this big ego. Instead of buying lunch for a team that you paid for just pay them as many of these employees are governing our safety. Hope you are proud of being the President to have the longest shut down. All for a wall that you said Mexico would pay.
There are far more criminals and murderers  that are white Americans ,  not to mention all the other American gangs and criminals than the 0.0132% of illegals that are criminals. Most drugs come through check points, human bodies, planes, etc. Hell, the drug cartels, can spend an extra couple of hundred dollars to go to Canada first then here. I mean damn...they have submarines and bring them all up and down the coast. You think an ignorant wall will stop them, lmbo! They are laughing at us!
There down there partying while Trump is here trying to get something done oh,and may i remind you Trump is doing his job without pay!
There has been borders before you became President and America never ceased to be a Nation. Small hand
There he is!
There is NO crisis at the border!!!!   The issue now is NOT the border, nor the stupid wall!!!!   The crisis now is this crybaby President hijacking not only our government, but almost a million of our citizens' livelihood!     #WorstPresidentEver  #Crybaby #CaresNotAboutTheCitizens
There is a reporter named Major Garrett who said that this president has done many good things for this country but the media won't report on that.   They are focused on making him look bad for opening our eyes to "fake news'. To hell with them! They have been lying to us for far too long. I quit watching the news because they can't be trusted to report the news honestly. They only tell their side.
There is a vet who raised 9 million for wall on go fund me. Saw it once then gone. Must be that the Dems stopped this.
There is no crisis at the border.  If there is, they should have done something the past two years.
There was a conspiracy to fix a election  did you hear that there was collusion  with a foreign hostile government ! Lock him up! Lock him up! Take all these treasonous  coconspirators  down with treasonous  donnie
There was a time i hated trump because as an African the only news network we can afford  is CNN but to know what he stands for & his commitment to do it changed my mind. because i love my country & a person who loves his country with all is what all countries need & trump is that person.
There's no crisis at the border now, but it's coming in groves!!! Get the wall built now!!!
These are looking more and more like dictator propaganda posters. I‚Äôm totally out of this mess in 2020. This is why the GOP, and America is losing.
These butt hurt mfers^^^ üòÇüòÇ Go back to your safe spaces. Fuckin snowflakes
These paid haters are really stupid, Soros needs to cough up a little more money and get some with some brains!
They already are.    They are stopping a dipshit man child from pissing money into a worthless wall to make bigots feel less scared.
They altered his finger to look longerüòÉ https://youtu.be/ujqHCanoJZg
They altered the picture to make him look thinner they even tried to make his little fingers longer LOL what a phony
They blew the chance to repeal Obamacare because the RINOs couldn't handle being in the majority. If go weak now, is over. They'll have a sickle and hammer on Old Glory by the next inauguration.
They photoshopped you nice in that photo
They should just give him the drop in the bucket for border security, It's pretty effing stupid to put so many lives in turmoil trying to stop something that already exists in many areas.
They‚Äôre getting paid because of Donald Trump‚Äôs signature. Also, your GOP members of Congress are getting paid as well, you dumb motherfucker
Think maybe he is Andrew Jackson come back to remind the House and Senate that the Constitution institutes a Chief Executive and neither the House nor Senate have authority over his execution of his Constitutional duties.  Pelosi is really beginning to come across as having mental problems...those of us who have seen our parents turn into our great-grand parents will know what I‚Äôm talking about.  Make me wonder who is taking care of her and Chucky Baby who both seem headed in that direction.  Really need leadership; not senile obstinacy.
Think, then type.
This Dimwit had two years of full Republican control to build a wall but instead chose to focus on tax cuts for the rich !
This FB post is a LIE! DHS and CBP statistics prove that we defend our borders.
This Is The Sign Of Your Absurdity
This Man we call our President, has suffered more from people like you than any President of the United States of American ever should...   We do Love him and we love the fact he is going the job no other has ever done before.  We Will Stand together or Fall.  This is for U, President Donald J. Trump.  Amen
This Motherfucker! You like. Being lied to and grabbing pussy
This bad hombre is a good campaigner!
This civilian salutes you Sir!!  thank you for your strong care and concern for the safety of this country, please don't back down about the wall
This especially pertains to DemocRATs and RINO RepubliCONs: "No man's life, liberty, or property are safe while the legislature is in session." -- Mark Twain
This from a man who is colluding with Russia. He is literally being investigated for being a Russian asset.
This guy is a dickhead plain and simple.
This has to STOP! https://insider.foxnews.com/2015/03/02/irs-defends-giving-refunds-illegal-immigrants
This is a comment from another person on a different post, but the best message yet.  Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
This is a future plan...I pray in Jess's name the plan succeeds
This is a household that totally AGREES.
This is about your ego buddy
This is an actual fact. A government's VERY FIRST DUTY is to protect its citizens.
This is coming from an orange Russian agent sitting in the oval office!#putinspuppet#impeachthemotherfucker!
This is no power play by us ;WE NEED THE WALL FOR SECURITY!!!!
This is one thing about Trump that baffles me. I would have been getting everything I could get done about border security while my party had total control of Congress. He wouldnt have had to put up with any BS from the Democrats. I think he is hurting himself even with his own supporters over shutting down the government for so long over something that could have already been handled.
This is quite literally untrue.
This is slavery forcing people to work without pay.   No Wall
This is so clear...what are the American people resisting? Democrats that are letting their childish hate for Trump are willing to let "everybody" into our country??  I'm old and thankful for once that I am so I won't be a part of seeing our country destroyed!!  GOD bless Trump and his followers!!
This is so very true.
This is the Netherlands and Belgium border.  I don‚Äôt see any wall, built during a time of record budget deficit. They are still very much independent nations.  https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Baarle-Nassau_fronti√®re_caf√©.jpg#mw-jump-to-licenseFile:Baarle-Nassau fronti√®re caf√©.jpg - Wikimedia Commonscommons.wikimedia.org
This is the beginning of martial law
This is the first PRESIDENT who care for this nattion , is like when Our LORD volunteer to die in the Cross for The SIN of the world they look as a feliar o LOSSER , is like Mr PRESIDENT TRUMP people look him his the problem  are you blaine
This is the first time since Barack Hussein Obama that we have been taken seriously.
This is the greatest President we ever had!  Doing the right thing is always controversial.  But doing what is right,is always the Best way to go.
This is the most TRUE SPOKEN WORDS!!! PRESIDENT TRUMP is only Trying to Help Americans and YOUR CHILDREN and GRANDCHILDREN‚ÄôS future ‚úÖüá∫üá∏
This is the soul purpose of the government.
This is the stupidest post I‚Äôve seen in a long time.  Is he trying to pretend he‚Äôs some sort of hero?
This is true.. If people don't believe it just leave!! You don't belong here then.
This is very true
This is what desperation looks like.
This is what i have said MANY times.
This is what the far left have been doing for YEARS. People seem to forget these things. The wall is not only to protect us from drug smugglers, human trafficking, gangs and sicknesses that have been eradicated from our country.   It's also to protect us from the far left with things like this.  https://youtu.be/yYnVKJMAV90
This is why the people elected you! Don't back down, you have the support of the people behind you!
This man obviously doesn't know there is more than one way to protect our borders. We live in a world of electronic aids and plenty of service men to protect our borders. He is obeying the orders of Fox News and his base. You know those folks he bragged about being able to Con. He doesn't care about the destruction he brings to our people.
This man will preserve your country  Unlike our useless Muppets in Westminster  Vote FOR TRUMP
This mofo looks like his knees don't bend. Or like he really does have a hand up his ass. LMBO #putinspuppet4real
This moron is doing a campaign rally. He‚Äôs so worried about brown people invading his space that he‚Äôs allowing the his own people to be cold and starve. Time to impeach. Sick of listening to his whining. Talks like the adderall has kicked in.
This old fool doesn't care anything about America, he only cares about himself and money.
This picture looks like um pull my finger I‚Äôm in 5 th grade üñï
This piece of s*** can leave the White House at any time you really care about America when you're not paying the same people you swore to protect.  How is somebody supposed to live without the money you don't give a s*** about America if you did then work with the Democrats at some point or at least are paying the federal employees for the jobs they are doing for your America
This rat would crap his pants if called to duty, that‚Äôs a responsibility unfamiliar his entire life.  Big office big talk!  He really would not know how to keep a tight ass when Hell happens.
This should read: If we don't stop the Russians then we cease to be a nation.
This shutdown has lasted more days than Trump has spent with Barron in his entire life.
This statement is soooooo true........there is no more room in my payck to cover  police costs or any other costs for people who run over the line looking for free help or to get into the sad illegal trades
This statements is nothing but the truth: AS A PRESIDENT THE DEFEND OF OUR NATION IS THE HIGHEST & MIST IMPORTANT DUTY. President Trump has proved it!
This wall distraction isn't going to work. Neither will shutting down the government. Mueller is coming for you and soon you'll be in prison. Traitor.
This wall is not an emergency. It takes 10 years to build knock at the f*** off and pay them people.
This whole narrative that trump won‚Äôt budge so the shutdown is going to drag on for a while is idiotic. McConnell can easily fix this with a veto-proof vote but his dumb ass can‚Äôt be found anywhere. Does Putin have you under his control too Mitch? This is totally a trump and republican shutdown and the people who are affected need to know that. The House has been passing Bills to reopen the government but McConnell won‚Äôt hold a vote in the senate. So there it is people.
This will be Trump's biggest problem. He is demonizing Democrats, but since the House now has a Democratic majority, he can't get a single bill passed if he can't get any Democrats to vote with him.
This will help immigrants to realize they have to come legally and safer for them.  Our country will turn into a country the immigrants are leaving if we don't have order
Thomas Evans why not consider the fact that Trump is a liar and conman?
Thomas Fico von Holt Your countries doing well I see........loser............

Tif Duff TROLL!!
Tif Duff Trump fixed so many problems already, INCLUDING the jail situation, as you so much wanted him to do. Seriously, can you give the man some time to do the best job as president than anyone else has ever done? He's not a communist, so you aren't going to get all that free stuff you want. Get a job.
Tif Duff if America isn‚Äôt great as we think why aren‚Äôt you and everyone else leaving? We would have most of Mexico and Central America trying to get in. Please!
Tif Duff problem now days is most people take the easy way out. If they weren‚Äôt we wouldn‚Äôt have 2-5 thousand people coming up from Central America wanting free stuff.   Lucky the French people figured it out and are currently trying to take back their country and fix it with their yellow vest movement.
Tif Duff twisted sister!! Lol its low thanks to OUR GREAT PRESIDENT!!
Tif Duff why were'nt you complaining when Obama was in office, he promised help for inner cities especially Chicago, notice how he never moved back there. Your a snowflake anyway
Tim Davidson You are a Fool!
Time to bust out the DOJ on them bitches .
Time to drain the swamp some more
Time to fire people,  30 days of shutdown approaching fastüòÇ
Time to step down and bring President Bush back...people are loosing health insurance and can't pay for car insurance car payment...
Timothy Betts Thanks for your comment. You must hate humanity if you think what I spouted off is a good thing, or best for America. Trumps shut down of the government is something we are ALL going to pay for. I agree to disagree with your comments.
Timothy Kershner Do you really think saying  "Shitty piece of garbage" is an intelligent way to influence people's opinions?  This is why no one listens to you.
Timothy Norton I would propose both. Seeing as the numbers of people coming are overwhelming.
Timothy Norton are you unaware that 3caravans from Honduras are headed here?
Timothy Norton justvwanted tonsee who would laugh and be angry over defending our country.
Timothy Norton well I`am from europe and President Trump is 100% correct about most european countrys not spending 2% on defence as for the southern border or any border in any country for that matter,you can`t have people wandering about coming and going as they please,from what I have read there is a huge volume of drugs comes into the USA through the southern border,if true thaat alone would be good enough reason for a wall even here in europe it has been a absolute disaster all the migrants getting in and allowed to wander unchecked ,just two days ago a afghan mirgrant stabbed a pregnant woman in hospital they managed to save the woman ,but the baby iis dead
Timothy Norton, You are so right, ANY GOVERNMENT IS SECULAR, but let's don't forget THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD;  I love how king David says in Psalms 103:19 "The Lord has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all."  Also the word says in Daniel 2:21 "He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning."  Have a blessed day ‚ù§
Tina Rojas #CNNsheep
Titouan Renard Borders are useless: people can even go out of the image now...
To Russia?
To all people who dislike and hate our president, I don‚Äôt think anyone including myself, agrees with the decisions that president Trump makes for our country. However, a president of a country and nation can‚Äôt make decisions graciously for each and every person. Also, he doesn‚Äôt have too. His job is to protect our country and keep it the greatest country in the world. The United States!!! Republican, Democrats, etc.. no matter your political views, support and help from all you Americans out there can really help our president and congress get this country back on track by supporting them and standing together as one nation, instead of putting them down and being selfish because many citizens of the U.S. aren‚Äôt getting their way. Things change. It‚Äôs life! It‚Äôs humanity. Accept and move on, and just be a good person. God bless everyone!
To all you libtard Dem morons out there ‚Äî THE WALL = WINNING.  Got it? ü§™
To bad our dumb ass prime minister here in Canada doesnt listen to Trump.
To be clear, because so many seem to want to imply this:  I do NOT think we should have open borders, nor do I think we should stop deporting illegals.  Though I certainly think we should prioritize deporting those illegals who are bad actors first...not hardworking illegals with families and a long history of positive behavior here.  Duh.  However, I do think we ought to spend our money on ACTUAL problems, like deporting those misbehaving here first and more and better train border security personnel.  One for immigration courts that currently seriously ask 5 year olds if they understand the nature of proceedings and sometimes perform proceedings over Skype.  We need to process asylum seekers and those accused of entering illegally with fast, fair and effective courts.  Obvious, we need to treat those being held pending trial humanely.  Keep children with parents (Jesus, do I really need to advocate that?), And stop the profiteering of private detention centers.  The proposed border wall fixes nothing and cost a fortune that could EASILY be better spent.  It is a bad idea that would not even fix the problems that are made up justify it.
To build the wall just take all confiscated money from drug bust in a year and there should be enough money to build that wall. Most of that $$$ would come from Mexico. So they would build the Wall.
To defend your nation you dodged the draft . Must have saved a lot of lives that way
To my black brothers and sisters--go to the library and read the history of America.  You will find that A. Lincoln and the Red party set you free from the democratic slave owners of the south.  Read about the underground railroad and the white people who helped save you from slavery--they we republicans.  Vote Red.
To preserve and protect is the President s job.  Ignore nonsense Nancy and her political agenda.   Build the walk.  Give your State of the Union address
To set an example.
To those liberals who say a couple thousand illegals crossing is not bad, how many would you consider a problem? 10,000? 100,000?  1 for me is too much, are you personally going to sponsor any of them?  I bet NO, why is that?
To those saying he isnt a fraud, are you so blind that you cant even see that this picture is photoshopped? He isnt even honest in photos
Toby Ruiz, true story
Today is my birthday. I'd like a wall to be built please. Thanks!
Today is the anniversary of a nuclear deal, a deal that did not last long and its main actor pulled out of the deal, the agreement now has no value for the Iranian regime, and they have been severely defeated. We made Twitter work to cancel this agreement and we are proud to have done this great work. Our first move was to prevent the agreement from changing in Congress, and we did not intervene with the influence of this agreement, the lobbyists of Israel were trying hard to change this agreement, but we did not let it work, we worked hard and made it harder. This agreement did not change and we succeeded in that. The next step was the expulsion of two officials from the White House, Tillerson and McMaster, those on Twitter, are seeing how we provided the terms for Tillerson and Mackman to be fired from the White House, and Bolton and Pompeo would take them. And we rushed to the last minute and made the conditions for a catastrophic agreement abandoned. I struggled hard and fought every day, if not for us, this agreement would never be canceled. Those on Twitter are testifying who made the catastrophic agreement canceled, and we are proud that with the help of the people we were able to do this great work and provide the conditions to cancel President Trump without interrupting the nuclear deal, and All sanctions will be restored. If the catastrophic agreement was not abandoned, the Iranian regime would be much more likely to be happy and appreciative than President Tramp at a much earlier date than anyone imagined that he would have a nuclear weapon, and that they would intervene in more countries, and that the Middle East would be very destabilizing. This agreement was withdrawn. Thanks to Pompeo, who supports our people and has announced in the Middle East that until April, Iran's oil exports will be completely cut off. Exceptions to the eight countries were a big mistake, and if oil was cut off completely until November 4th, the oil price would have fallen again, the exemption to eight countries made the Democrats take over Congress, accept President Trump that the mistake And I hope you do not repeat this mistake because people do not forget. We have forgotten the exemption for eight countries and, as you and the US Secretary of State promise, you would say that the breaks will not be renewed, if you do not repeat your promise this time, they will all mock you and the Iranian regime will definitely be a nuclear weapon. And this time, the lives of the Americans and Israel will be at risk, I hope you are wise and until April to complete Iran's oil industry, so far, there is a lot of time spent that does not benefit the national security of the United States. The Polish conference is the end of the Islamic Republic, and it provides conditions for countries to support the free people of Iran in order to protect the suffering people who are demanding change, to create another honor and to celebrate the victory in the Freedom Square.

Too bad Congress doesn‚Äôt care this much.
Too bad Putin is a really the one in control
Too bad democrats don't have such high standards.
Too dumb for Nancy Pelosi. She owns you now.
Too few understand and are unaware that the left is destabilizing the country for overthrow and subversion. Just today, rising democrat 'star" Beto O'Rourke stated that the US Constitution is an outdated document that should be replaced, and Elizabeth Warren said that the electoral college should be destroyed and replaced by mob rule (aka democracy). In 1958 an FBI agent wrote a book called 'The Naked Communist'. In this book he listed 45 communist goals for overthrowing the United States. One of the rules was: "Instill the idea that the US Constitution is outdated and a product of it's time". This was written 60 years ago. This is why the left is trying to disarm patriots. Too few are understanding the big picture. The left is dismantling the USA and it will be replaced by a communist dictatorship.
Too many delusional people out there that want to keep the status quo.  This needs to get done.

True, Presidents Trumps 289 accomplishments since the election has restored America to greatness. Let‚Äôs not overlook the fact that the world is a safer place since Trump started denuclearization talks with North Korea. No more missiles flying, and North - South Korea in peace talks. The economy booming, millions of jobs, 4 million fewer people on food stamps. Americans can have pride once again, after being ashamed and embarrassed by obama for 8 years.
True, even for those who don't like it.
True. And cultures cease to exist. Thats is just what the NWO demons want.
True...

True?
Truer words have never been spoken!  America's sovereignty hangs in the balance. The choice is to secure our border now, or allow the U.S.A. and everything that millions fought and died for to perish from the face of the earth. There is no higher priority at this point in time. I choose to stand with President Trump. üá∫üá≤Ô∏è

Trump Organization‚Äôs Use of Foreign-Worker Visas Reaches 10-Year High: TPM  Despite President Trump‚Äôs anti-immigration rhetoric, it appears that the Trump Organization has been using foreign workers at a higher rate than ever before, Talking Points Memo reports. The organization requested and received at least 192 visas for foreign workers in 2018‚Äîthe highest for the company going back to at least 2008, according to Department of Labor data. The Trump Organization received an average of 116 visas per year in the decade prior to 2018, according to American Bridge, a Democratic research group. Review of the data revealed that the visas were almost entirely for the type of low-skilled foreign workers that Trump has claimed drive down American wages. Cooks, servers, housekeepers, and farmworkers make up a large chunk of the Trump Organization‚Äôs requests, most of them making between $10 and $15 hourly. The largest number of the Trump Organization‚Äôs foreign-worker visas in 2018 went to his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Florida. Last year, the resort received 78 temporary foreign-worker visas last year for waiters, cooks, and maids.  DailyBeast
Trump and his base need to back off on the name calling. Now that the House is under Democratic control he won't get a single bill passed unless he tries to treat people with respect.
Trump and his base need to dial back the name calling. Now that the House is under Democratic control he won't get a single bill passed if he can't get enough Democrats to support him.

Trump gets the job done, even if others don't agree. We now have another caravan coming again. I feel sorry for people who have traveled so far, but we need to get our own homeless people off the streets, and put those who have been waiting for years to become a citizen first. I am sick and tired of those who condemn us that voted for Trump. Its our freedom folks. You forget, that Presidents before Trump were all dealing with the same issues as he is. The only difference is that he is tackling the problems and getting them done. None of the caravans have ever been inoculated against viruses, so they will be bringing in the diseases and then some. All those complaining, should try and do the job or help out.
Trump got 27% of registered voters last time .  Won on electoral college ... He won't win again... If he lives that long
Trump has no way out if he does not keep his promise on NK.
Trump has two sides of brain. In the left side, there is nothing right - and in the right side, there is nothing left.
Trump hasnt done anything illegal or fraudulent at all. You're basically trying to overturn democracy.
Trump hates Powerful women.  In fact he despises them.  - Pelosi Has denied him his State of the Union Address  - Pelosi arguably has more power than he does right now  -  Pelosi will ultimately lead the Impeachment of this alleged Russian Asset  This Powerful woman Wins!
Trump if you remain president we will cease to be a nation.
Trump is a compulsive liar,  the world knows Russia helped trump get elected because the Russians didn't want Hillary Clinton to win.  Trump has always cheated, lied, insults and threats.  He is the bankrupt king. He always has lived very well on other peopples money. He is a new York thug
Trump is a doo doo head. LOL üòÜ
Trump is a fighter and he will win no matter what the cost is or who it affects just so he can get his TAX BREAKS, oh sorry WALL

Trump is making America a third world country. He is dividing and mail g America hate everyone
Trump is making America crazy!...not great again!! Am I the only one who can see that!!
Trump is not a leader.  A leader is someone who unites the people and moves the agenda forward and does not place blame or excuses for the obstacles. Trump promised that Mexico would pay for the wall and now he is holding Americans as  hostages because of a promise he can't fulfill. But in reality, this wall issue, is just a distraction of the investigation of his anti-american behavior.
Trump is nothing more then a baby he cries over what a dam wall he's shut down the dam government who does that I'd tell him to his face he's nothing more then a rich man who wants his way making america great again bs trump pack up your bags let a real man run this world not some spoiled rich man i got a great idea build a wall around him what's next for this dumb ass
Trump is one of the best, if not the best, presidents this country has ever seen.  Too bad the Republicans in Congress wouldn't act together when they had both houses, because Trump would have cleaned house in the first few months.
Trump is protecting his country like a good president should. Obama and Bush ran this place in the ground and since Trump has taken office there has been vast improvements in the job fields with thousands of jobs and the Unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in awhile.  Trump has my vote in 2020 !
Trump is pulling troops out of Syria so his friend Putin could walk all over Syria and before you know it they will be as they were in the70' s to 80' s
Trump is right, no matter what anyone says. A Nation needs secure Borders, never more so obvious than now.
Trump is selling out and letting illegals become US Citizens and I won‚Äôt be voting for this draft dodging weakling in 2020
Trump is selling out our country.  He is NOT defending it. Former Bush Official Richard Painter: "President Donald Trump has fulfilled almost all of Vladimir Putin's dreams and plans to expand the global power of Russia by diminishing the power, respect and influence of the United States."
Trump is so awesome! Thank you for keeping America safe! Democrats were elected to shut down the government Stand strong gladiator Trump
Trump is the WORST president ever in the history of the United States üá∫üá∏ of America. He is a disgrace that continues to ruin and embarrass its citizens!!!
Trump is the best
Trump is the stupidest president in the history of this country. What a fucking idiot.
Trump is using a historically accurate axiom. "A country without borders is not a country."  We annexed Florida because their inhabitants raided our border towns until we said stop.  Illegal immigrants raid our jobs and don't give me "the Americans won't work the jobs they take" crap. It is an urban legend recently proven false. Americans DO work those jobs and still hold a majority in most of them.  We have been sold lies by political hacks and it has to stop. If people come here LEGALLY, then have at it it is fair game but just say 'no' to illegal immigration
Trump keep firm.  Evil is unashamed.  Everybody who voted for you are votin for you again
Trump knows that :"The winter is coming" so for that he needs the Wall and it will be built. Until now why The America didn't need any walls? Why only after 54 years the UK leaved the EU. They know what is coming. Less vital resources means fight for survival.Have a nice day and don't forget to smile.üòÅ
Trump loves Am√©rica.Pelosi loves globalists.
Trump loves the ego stroking that comes with the SOTU. All those legislators, Supreme Court justices, honored guests, etc. If he gives a speech somewhere else it is just another speech. He wants the pomp and circumstance that prove he is the President.
Trump needs to resign. He is a disgrace to the office. He needs to stop with all the lies and be truthful to the American people.
Trump out !!! You are destructing the world üò§
Trump please we the Nigerian about the upcoming election, we no longer need huhari
Trump prevented Hillary from going into another country to destabilize it for Israeli commie interests. Hillary is no Christian American Patriot.
Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. Now, Mexico said fck no, and the people don't care...   Hmmm, what other lies has he told...
Trump said when he gets into office he will get rid of all the lazy people referring to those on government assistance! Schools are running out of funding which means lunches. SNAP is releasing the last of it‚Äôs funds the 19th, after that no more funds. Commods will be done as well. Housing developments aren‚Äôt funded so people who are on housing and HUD will be evicted due to non-payment. Prisons aren‚Äôt getting food. Not to mention nobody will get PELL right away which means a lot of families will go without. Farmers are seeing an effect by not being able to pay their bills. Medicaid/IHS will be limited as they will use the resources they have.. Families will go hungry enough to start robbing food and riots will start breaking out! Crime rates are going to increase too. All thanks to those of you who voted for Trump! ü§° Pat yourself on the back... real proud of your President ain‚Äôt cha! I‚Äôm waiting for the simpsons episode to come true! I‚Äôm ready for impeachment!
Trump should sign an executive order that all Senators and their staff shouldn't be paid until they resolve this shutdown.
Trump stop the hoax.  Open the government you Russia agent!
Trump suborned perjury which is a very serious crime.
Trump supporters , you have no relevance. You are a Trump supporter. You obviously have no common sense, no morals, and are too gullible to have an intellectual opinion, since you are dumb enough to support Trump. You have been conned. A damn wall really? A wall to swim or boat around, because the wall can't block waterways. A wall to dig under, because they haven't been building mile long tunnels across the border already. A wall they can't climb over, blast or cut through like they have done. A wall they can't fly over....I mean, Trump supporters have no common sense, to know it's a waste of money. Especially, when we have a homeless problem and places like Flint!
Trump supporters. Name calling with nothing else!
Trump this is total Bullshit! What a Propaganda post ! We will be a Nation and "STUPID Trump" isn't gonna fly in with his tights and cape to save the day ! Trump you are so PATHETIC! Trump,your first and only priority is to open up the Government NOW, so these people can get paid ! Trump, you think that by NOT paying the Border Patrol that there won't be the cartels to swoop in with butt loads of money to tempt these people! Wow, that sounds a might bit CRAZY! There had already been CORRUPTION on the Southern Border !Trump, you are complete imbecile,pay the Coast Guard ASAP, they keep our borders "SAFE" ! If this is Not some kinda of "SiCK " game and a Political ploy to "USE" your CRAZY base,then prove it ! OPEN UP THE GOVERNMENT! I still am interested in where all the 1.6 Billion Dollars that you got in March went ? Why are you asking for an additional 5.7 Billion dollars ? Why hold these Feberal workers "Hostages" just so you can say "I won " ? It should demonstrate to the American people that you don't "Care" about the citizens of this Nation and that you are a "Greedy ,INCOMPETENT,EGOTISTICAL,,LIAR "! Trump your tweet about Schumer is very PATHETIC,you Fired Comey because of the "Russia Thing"! What Trump are you grasping at straws? Trump ,you could go today and TESTIFY to Mueller Face to Face and put it all behind you ,since all of this is just more Distraction from the Meuller investigation! Dude,you still have the option to RESIGN before you are in PRISON! Why don't you just to that,save the country money and time in your IMPEACHMENT hearings !
Trump ur a fucking  morron
Trump we need more FREEDOM, give us the bumb stocks back.
Trump were  supporting u all the way at least YOU DO WHAT U SAY UR GOING TO DO
Trump you are awesome!  MAGA
Trump you had 2 years when Republicans controlled BOTH the House & Senate.  Why didn‚Äôt you get the wall money then? Why wait to ask Dems who already said they don‚Äôt want a wall?  And why has the Senate proposed nothing as they are STILL controlled by Republicans. I don‚Äôt blame Pelosi for this shut down.  This is on you Trump!  And on Republicans who don‚Äôt really want the wall or they would have done something about it when they controlled everything üò°
Trump you look like a college basketball coach about to take your team to the final four I love it
Trump you need to threaten to take away TSA. Same difference protecting passengers and you are tring to protect citizens.
Trump you want to make USA great again. You need to stop this shutdown so federal employees can return to work. Families need a pay check to pay bills, meds, gas car payments, etc. None of these things do you need to worry about, so do not insult Americans saying you now what they are going thru because it is another lie coming out of your mouth.
Trump!Trump!!Trump!!!

Trump's administration has more criminal indictments and convictions, after only two years in office, than any of the past ten presidents accumulated in their entire terms of office.  Explained in simple English for the benefit of Trump supporters:  THIS IS THE MOST CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION OF YOUR LIFETIME.
Trump's chief economic adviser to federal workers: Get a loan  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-chief-economic-adviser-to-federal-workers-get-a-loan/
Trump's vanity wall's primary missions are to keep his supporters happy, protecting his presidency from sliding into irrelevancy, and maintaining GOP authority, after its members have sold their souls for complicity in not speaking up against Trump's less than stellar language and behaviors.  If Trump was truly concerned about effective border security, he wouldn't have placed so much importance on a 'wall' being the centerpiece, or at least would've consulted engineers, ecologists, financial planners, and sociologists to ensure the walls/fences/barriers would be designed thoughtfully, meeting the most effectiveness possible, while limiting ecological, environmental, and financial disaster.  He's only had 3 years to do the leg work, so of course his argument is STILL based upon xenophobic hyperbole and easily disprovable misinformation.
Trump,  Nancy Pelosi is the boss!  Do as your told and know your place.  Open the Government! !!
Trump, STOP waiting for permission and BUILD THE WALL. ‚ÄúGet Er Done‚Äù. Then change every law that gives illegals all the freebies that Legal Migrants never ever had. Then replace our federal tax system with the FAIRTAX. You‚Äôre the Best for America.
Trump, day 27 of YOUR shutdown!  Innocent people NOT getting paid .. because of you!  YOU should be ‚ÄúIMPEACHED‚Äù.. just for this alone!   America is defenseless alright, defenseless from you!  Holding people hostage, withholding pay, (stealing) just to get a Monument to your name, ‚ÄúThe Trump Wall‚Äù!  Sick .. and totally unfit for office!
Trump, just saw released photos of various slat wall designs you've supported where the we're defeated with saws...  Middles of the fences just missing?   Why are you suppressing these failures and still promoting this failed technology that now has been shown not to work?  Is this yet another Trump Inc deal with some builders?
Trump, please turn to our God for direction of what to do. I understand the importance of the wall, but also understand the importance of millions that are vulnerable at this time. I only pray we can turn to the Lord of Host for guidance and direction. Thank you Missionary Marie

Trumpaganda Style.
Trumpateers, I‚Äôve seen the debates on both sides of who‚Äôs to blame for the shutdown. For 2 years Republicans were in power and this could have been settled. Then last fall,up comes the Cohen thing and Manafort thing and possible collusion by Russia. Mid term elections came and Democrats win the house. All of a sudden, there‚Äôs a big border wall crisis. Trump shuts down the government and Republicans leave the house Dec. 13 cause there is no use. January 1st comes Democrats are in power with no government,meaning further inquiries into trump‚Äôs allegation go nowhere. That‚Äôs why trump is going to make this last and why Mitch McConnell is hiding. Make any sense?
Trumps administration so far: 33 indictments, 187 criminal charges, 32 separate guilty pleas
Trumps fat
Trump‚Äôs Middle East Plan leaked in Jerusalem Post is an evil response from Satan to my open letter to Israel   In regard to the Third Temple and Christianity (see below) Satan wants to confuse the world and Unite  the nations based on Noah and not based on Christ. This is an anti-christ plan coming from the swamps of several countries. Please, read again my open letter to Israel. They didn‚Äôt want my open letter and wanted to create problems with the President Plan. The Lord is not in agreement of the division of Israel and Jerusalem (Exodus 23:31) USA could be punished by God with natural disasters because of this division. In fact, it has been chastened with Natural Disasrers  since the plan has been crafted. Please, leave this matter as it is now. Just focus on rebuilding the Third Temple and don‚Äôt do animal sacrifices inside  or outside it. The Messiah will take care of Jacob (Israel) and Esau (Palestine)  when He returns. God created the conflict with these twins and He is the only ONE With power and wisdom to solve it (Genesis 25:19-24)  Remember that our battle is not with flesh and blood but with Satan himself (Ephesians 6:10) ‚ÄúBecause if Satan transforms  himself into an angel of light, therefore, his ministres also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness whose end will be according to their work‚Äù 2 Corinthians 1:14-15

Uhm... we don't. You don't need a wall to have border security
Uhm....you need to educate yourself with a map, and how are your borders open?
Um...defending the Constitution comes first...it says so in the oath you swore.
Umm that's only 1 one of your many jobs. . . Meanwhile you aren't doing any of them well.

Unfortunately our nation is self destructing and may be too far gone for you to save. I am praying for you and our nation
Unfortunately, My President is starting to kowtow to the Democrats.
Unless you're Natave American, you can STFU! Those crayons you're eating are effecting your IQ.ü§°
Unless your ancestors were living, breathing, working, loving and dying in this land prior to 1942- you are a descendant of immigrants, and have no right to tell others to stay out.
Until someone pays him to do otherwise like Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, etc etc etc!!! Our Nation is for sale!!! All for Trump pocketbook!!!

Use DOD budget to build the wall and move on already.  Seal the border... all of it.  Can't count on the demoncrats to keep us safe.  Do it to it.
Use El Chapo money to pay for Wall..
Use all seized cash from drug busts to fund the wall. In a sense, this is Mexico paying for it. Done.
Use your power and build the wall. Clearly the dems will not concead

Valerie Spofford Tilley the USDA in Montana just called back all their staff to work for 3 days. They did this so they wouldn't be furrowed. One office in particular staffs 7 people vital they all get so much vacation time there is usually only 2 or 3 working. If that doesn't show non-essential I am not sure what does. That is what is happening all across government jobs.
Valerie Spofford Tilley what‚Äôs pointless is taking out loans to feed my family after 18 years of service to my country you ignorant Facebook commando.  #paythecoastguard #paydhs

Voted for Trump and still happy I did.  He is a business man trying to exist in the world of politics.  Business people set goals and try to reach them along with bringing profits to their stock holders.  I consider myself to be a stock holder in America and I hope our President can bring our country to its full potential like any other business.  On the other hand all the Dems seem to be interested in is getting reelected, get with it guys, if you can't help make America great go away, we won't miss you!

WHY ARE THE DEMOCRATS NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AT THE BORDER, YET THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR SAFETY AT THE STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH, BEHIND THE WALLS OF THE CAPITOL?
WHY ARE WE PAYING N PALOSI -* SHE DOESNT WANT TO WORK THINGS OUT ON BORDER SECURITY - HER ANSWER IS NO NO NO NO  *She doesn't want to come out of her hiding place to meet THE ANGEL MOMS & DADS THAT WAS IN HER OFFICE.  By the way WE SHOULD CALL THE WALL/BORDER THE "ANGEL WALL OR ANGEL BORDER" *She doesnt want to have your night when you talk to the AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO WHY ARE WE PAYING HER ?
WHY WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE WALL and BOARDER SECURITY:  OUR FORESTS ARE TELLING US, WE NEED TO LISTEN!  Unfortunately, for our forests we have let the bittersweet vines grow unchecked and now they are choking the trees and killing them - our forests are a tangled mess. Forest management has been ignored for many years.  The resulting forest fires are devastating as they consume our homes and lives.  The vines need sunlight/and room for their roots to grow they are green and lush and the awesome tunnels they create; so they kill the trees also killing their roots; thus they let the sun shine in - their vines flourish and their tentacle roots spread.  The roots are so thick that new trees also perish.    Our society is facing the same fate. Unfortunately FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS we need to manage our population.  To do this we need to have a strong immigration policy, we need to stop pushing our children into high paying careers, and support the working class. Without farmers, mechanics, electricians, plumbers, construction workers, house keeps, childcare workers, store cashiers, and shelf stockers  etc our society will crumble.  We need decent low income housing so that hardworking low income workers will not end up homeless.  WE DO NOT NEED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO FILL THESE JOBS.  Illegal immigration is like the vines - the expense on low income working US citizens is very real.    Eventually we will all be victims.
WOW!!! What a bunch of moronsllll

Walls are a terrible expenditure of our security dollars.  They are more of a vanity project
Walls are built to confine, most countries with walls are war ridden and it is to keep their enemies out.. Mexico is not our enemy.. other wall are built in communist countries and are meant to prevent their people from leaving „Äã„Äã welcome to the Republican agenda!
Walls are currently working in 77 other countries, a wall will work here as well.
Walls dont work,  Joshua 6;20,  wall of Berlin.  Name it. Hatred walls wont do good.  But hey lets waste money on it its cool.

We Nigerians wish to have your type as our president, people don't know what they have, long live the president,long live America.
We Support You 100% BUILD the USA WALL.
We The American People need and deserve National Security! It is our right!!!  This is the number one priority of the U.S. government...to protect America and Americans. Those that do not agree only wish us harm. All for greed and power.    Stats and Border Patrol say walls work. Even Jim Acosta proved this on air. I believe the professionals at the borders day in and day out know more than those that live in their ivory towers and their 'followers'. No a wall will not take care of all, but it will help! Safety First...it is a RIGHT for all Americans.
We agree with you President Trump!!
We agree! Anti Americans who don‚Äôt protect our citizens can leave.
We all need and want you President trump to defend our border. If you do that you have defend the whole America. President trump sign up to be President of America, to help them to where America was. President trump did not sign up for game in America. We stand with you 2020. Thanks you the best President ever.
We all thought that your most important duty was being an amoral shitbag that sells out their country to Russia, or to put other lawmaker's lives in danger because they rightly embarrassed your ignorant ass. Please, PLEASE have a massive coronary attack where your heart literally EXPLODES! Alternately, you could choke to death on a double quarter pounder, and we'd all be better off, scumbag.

We are being invaded and Dems are counting them as votes instead of invaders.
We are going to cease being a nation if there isn‚Äôt voter ID laws by Nov. 2020.
We are less safe than we were for this. That's on the Trumper-tantrum.
We are not a nation now. We are a crybaby country.
We are not under attack by Mexico what in the world are you talking about ?
We are the American people support you appreciate you and pray for you and God bless you
We are the most heavily defended country on earth. Illegal immigration is at its lowest point in 50 years after falling for the 10th straight year.  The majority of illegal immigrants flew in and overstayed visas. 90% of all illegal drugs are smuggled in through border crossings. You are a liar who wants a PR stunt.
We are with you President Trump. We have another Invasion on its way and two more after that. Whoever is Leading these Caravans needs to be Arrested. We see Lawyers down there from here encouraging these people. Please tell me we are not paying for these Lawyers. Any Lawyer who goes against our Law should be disbarred.
We are with you to the end Mr President.
We are with you.
We aren't solving anything by holding government aid hostage. Many have died, more will too, over aid cuts. Its important to make a friggen decision and MOVE FORWARD before section 8, food, and water are unavailable to the group's and individuals who need it.
We believe in your Sir! We need to get our government workers back to work, so use a combo of the Fund Me page and all the seized cash from drug busts to fund the wall. In a sense, this "IS" Mexico paying for it. Done. I'm sure someone must have put this idea forward before!
We bleveave I you Mr. President! we have a solution that even the Democrats cannot say is not a great solution for the wall! A solution That will not cost AMERICAN tax payers a dim! Don‚Äôt let them make you part of the problem! We voted you in office because we believe you were not part of the political aristocracy! We know Both parties are playing us and persisting in there stupid political games! The money is there! Use the drug money confiscated from the drug cartels and Human traffickers. According to Senator   Ted Cruise it‚Äôs $14 billion$& No tax dollars need to be spent on this wall!üò§ü§Øüá∫üá∏ Mr. President stop letting the party bosses/deep state manipulate the people and you!

We can defend our borders without your wall.  We can have border security without your wall.  We can have a nation without your wall.  The U.S.-Mexico border has basically been where it is for about 160 years, and our nation has persisted all that time.
We can help are president,to build the wall with electricity ‚ò†Ô∏è...ok mr president I have one question for you?why you don‚Äôt collect money for all the people of the United States ‚ù§Ô∏è !!course with people who love are country!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
We cease to be a nation if we have a king/dictator.
We cease to be a nation when our president lies about everything.  What about the 4 Americans that died because you said we were pulling out of Syria?????
We cease to be a nation when the elected head of government colludes with a foreign power to diminish our democracy.
We cease to be a nation when the president values the word of Putin over the word of all his own intelligence agencies.
We cease to be a nation when you don‚Äôt support the people that actually live in it and work for you! End the shutdown and let your people get paid and get the economy back!
We cease to be a nation with a traitor as president. #impeachthemotherfucker.
We ceased as a nation when you got elected ya moron
We ceased being a nation when you became president and the Russian party took over...right trump, you are Putin's puppet.  America knows you only serve Putin trump.  Da Comrade
We ceased being a nation when you sold us out to Putin
We ceased to be a Nation when you Shut Down our Government! FOOL
We ceased to be a nation when YOU got elected by the Electoral College, NOT the American People.
We ceased to be a nation when YOU took office.
We ceased to be a nation when we appointed Donald Trump as president.
We ceased to be a nation when you got faux elected and started running this country and it‚Äôs people into the gutter along with you. Disgusting fool.
We ceased to be a nation when you were elected.
We ceased to be as a DECENT nation when your sorry ass took over, but one we toss your worth less behind out, we will come back stronger than ever.
We ceased to be the nation we use to be when you wouldn't take advise from the various people who you have fired. You have't drained the swamp, you are filling it up with people who have NO clue of what they should be doing. Everyone is laughing at you!
We could lose that option.  Our country is being inundated without regard to screening for criminals.
We could probably just run that goddamn tie you're wearing the length of the border and call it good.
We do and we are.
We do defend our borders quit being so dramatic! üò≥üò≥
We do defend our borders. Ridiculous statement.
We do need defenses.
We do not have open borders you cultist
We do not. What rubbish
We don't deserve such an awesome President.
We don't have a border so I guess we will cease to exist pretty soon!! The illegals continue to pour into this country and no longer lie about why they are coming. FOR A JOB
We don't have open borders. The budget proposed by the house, which is the exact same one proposed by republicans in December, includes 21.5 BILLION for border security. I'll tell you what if trump will tax the top 5% at 70% to cover costs and bring down the deficit he can have the wall even though we know walls don't work. https://www.usatoday.com/border-wall/story/drug-trafficking-smuggling-cartels-tunnels/559814001/
We don't need a 25 billion dollar wall for border  security.  There are more modern ways to do the same thing.  Trumpy and Mitch own the shutdown over this.  Quit grandstanding and put people back to work.
We don't need the wall.  Most Americans don't want it. Be a President,  not a pandering politician.
We don't you fucking idiot, Jesus Christ.  Clearly never had to wait hours to cross the border.
We don't! Ptf, you believe every little thing he says.
We dont its a Republican  lie.
We don‚Äôt have open borders. We are one of the strictest nations to get into. Have you ever even tried to get into the United states? Idiots.
We elected you to do a job and you are doing that job. I‚Äôll vote for you in 2020 again
We fully support you President Trump!
We had well guarded borders before the Trump Shutdown occurred. Thanks to Trump for leaving the borders unsecured and open. Now just about about anyone armed can pass through the gates at our airports. Remember how Osama bin laden got into the country and planned the attacks ok n 9/11?  May as well just reopen the government and put more armed security to work. Because right now we have open borders because of Trump.
We have 2 borders dum ass
We have ZERO Moral Authority in the world as long as you are leading us.  You‚Äôve sold our nation to enrich yourself.  NOTHING ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù about America with you in the WH.  MANY Are Getting Arrested #MAGA
We have a TRAITOR as our President.
We have already ceased to be a nation...... thanks moron
We have been a nation before you came on the scene.
We have been defending our borders quite successfully without your fifth century vanity wall that Mexico was supposed to build.
We have more than one border. Why is it you only worry about the one where the brown people cross?
We have net zero immigration from Mexico. And there is already a wall.
We have such a good border and defense. I think Don the Con wants the wall not because of security but because he wants a Trumpski wall. Donnie the Carnie right now is letting ISIS and all Terrorists in through our airports and oceans because of the Shutdown. Starve our Federal Employees for PutieTang.
We have your back and Proud to call you President!!!
We have your back. Thank you!
We hear you Nehemiah
We help other countries with our hard earned money. If Mexico cannot take care of their own then keep the border open and let us take your country. Stop your wretched complaining about building a wall or not.Take care of your own people and stop burdening America with your own problems.U.S. provides aid worth $320 million a year to Mexico; experts say yanking it could hurt. Thanks Mexico for nothing.At the federal, state, and local levels, taxpayers shell out approximately $134.9 billion to cover the costs incurred by the presence of more than 12.5 million illegal aliens, and about 4.2 million citizen children of illegal aliens. That amounts to a tax burden of approximately $8,075 per illegal alien family member and a total of $115,894,597,664. The total cost of illegal immigration to U.S. taxpayers is both staggering and crippling. In 2013, FAIR estimated the total cost to be approximately $113 billion. So, in under four years, the cost has risen nearly $3 billion. This is a disturbing and unsustainable trend. Besides this burden the U.S assists other countries in aid.

We need the wall by all means necessary!
We need the wall!! Never give in Mr. President!!

We need to get Flint clean water, fix are D rated infrastructure,  stop gun violence, and pay people a living wage.
We need to have the ability to remove Senators and Congressmen when their are not for America and it's people. I want to remove them at any time, not just at Voting time. Also the lifers. Term limits! Congressmen for the most part are all for themselves? Not for us, never were.
We need to lock up the Marxists! So you can try to destroy a nation and be a terrorist organization as long as it's under the guise of a political party?
We need to protect our borders. Every other country does so why can't we?
We need to re-brand Mr. Fibb's slogan of "Make America Great Again" into "Hugs from Thugs"... Admittedly,he will sell out the will of the majority of country for $5.7B....take hostage a whole level of or workforce and not even mention them, create crisis and then take credit for fixing the crisis, and he will sell us out abroad... All it takes is an admiration letter or say you admire him. Aren't you glad you don't live in a dictator country where they can make you disappear, execute you, or starve you to death, deny you your legal rights??? America help feed those that are unpaid, unable to go to work population and thrive.. don't let the hostages suffer..give all you can, if you can..
We need too!!! I am with you all the way.
We need you in Sweden. Our prime minister is like a pajamas boy.
We nerd security borders
We r 20 TRILLION in debt !!!   We can Not take everyone in the world in all at once.   Protect. US Citizens 1st !!    COUNTRY b4 PARTY POLITICS !!!    COME HERE LEGALLY.
We risk losing a whole city when they figure out how to sneak a nuke in.
We should force democrats who dont want a wall to pay for it, sort of like Obamacare
We should start air lifting pieces of the Great wall of China to put on the boarder. China doesnt really need/use it like we do.
We should use the seized drug money to build the wall legalize marijuana and tax it federally to pay the people working at the wall and to maintain it
We shouldn't.  And we don't.
We stand behind you Mr. President! Nobody believes the media! They had to edit Nancy‚Äôs videos to show her not stuttering after you backhanded her yesterday. Dems are cracking, now ask for 10 billion!!
We stand behind you President Donald J. Trump!  We want a safe nation and we love what you're fighting for.  Stay strong...we love you :)
We stand with you Mr President
We stand with you Mr. President üá∫üá∏
We stand with you, Mr. President. Build the wall.
We started down that path when idiots elected you President... God Save America Again...get rid of this moron!
We still needed Democratic votes when we had the Congress and Senate.
We support you and thank you for your tireless efforts toward our safety and security. 2020 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
We thank God that you are the President and are defending our sovereignty.
We that  voted for you are behind you a 100%, build that wall.
We the People need to get Mexico out of our butt.
We the People want the Wall!
We the people elected you as our President and we are behind you all the way. The Democrats in office that are trying to stop you were put there long ago and seem to have lost there way as to what is good for America as a free country. The only thing i can see the Democrats are trying to do is push socialism and one world order on Americans. The sad thing is a lot are falling for it. Now my question is " what is in it for those trying to stop the President from doing his job" . It definitely can't be in the best interest of Americans.
We the people hired this man to do a job. He has come through on more items than any president in decades! Ask why these people oppose. What is the real game here. The democrats have something to lose and you can bet its monetary. We the people need to rise up.
We voted for Pres Trump, but since he won't build a wall, and shut down the border, we're not sure at this point if we will vote for him !
We want a WALL.
We want the wall
We were a nation before you and hope we last long enough to dump your sorry ASS !
We were doing just fine without you criminal.
We will always prevail with Trumps keen political skills
We will be a nation long after your pathetic "presidency" spanky boy
We will build wall if u promise to stay on other side
We will cease to be a nation the longer putin controls you.  Right now putin is in charge of our nation thanks to you,, traitor.....
We will get our " Wall"
We will not build Donald Trump's fucking white supremacist wall. We will force our Congressional leaders and Representatives to impeach,  indict and imprison him.
We will only be closer to a Nation until the Non American democrats defeat you and us Deplorables. I Pray for God to help you restore USA üá∫üá∏ and bring Pelosi and Schumer under His Control for the BETTER of All People. üôèüá∫üá∏
We will see how stuck we are.
We wouldn‚Äôt have a leader working for a hostil power to start
We're going to assume Rudy Giuliani was ALLEGEDLY drunk (again) when he went on CNN last night to walk back the whole NO COLLUSION narrative that Trump and Co. have been peddling for the past two years. Perhaps Giuliani suffering verbal diarrhea after a bad word salad, or maybe he was just foreshadowing the next Mueller indictment, but Chris Cuomo was dumbfounded when Giuliani blithered, "I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign. I have no idea."
We've all had enough.of it. Declare the security emergency at the borders, we the people who still know common sense realize the drugs are coming in from outside the USA. Then reopen the government, and then announce you will be addressing the nation on January 30th from the Senate!! That is a great idea.from Rand Paul.
We've been a nation all this time. It takes this dude to come and tell us we're not?? I'm really getting tired of you bad-mouthing American Trump
We've been a nation long before you and your "barrier" became America's reality TV.
We've been defending our borders for hundreds of years. We will always defend our borders. Stop trying to create a fake crisis to distract from your obvious Russian collusion and conspiracy.  https://www.thedailybeast.com/cohen-hired-it-firm-to-rig-online-polls-for-trump-says-report?source=articles&via=rss
We've never had opwn borders, idiot.
We, the true Americans, are with you ever step Mr. President!
Weapons of Mass Destruction have been found in Mexico! #MAGA
Weapons of mass destruction turned out to be a lie.  This could be one too.
Webster Lynn Anybody who's seen more than two of these estimates knows that they're all over the map. You haven't even given a reference, so for all we know, you made this one up.
Webster Lynn Gld your awake, what do you support if it's not America?
Webster Lynn YOU ARE CORRECT ON ALL COUNTS
Webster Lynn, it‚Äôs actually a small price to pay when one considers we spend 310 billion in annual interest on 22 trillion in debt
Webster you didn't finish the verse, "but I found no one".
Weird, because you fucking that up really bad.
Well I just received a call from my kids food program. You might be ‚Äúceasing a nation‚Äù as we speak. Enjoy your hamburger.
Well I know I'm going out of state to vote in 2020 just so the orange faced baby handed devil doesn't get that second term
Well cease to be the nation we are for many other reasons other than this border "crisis". Only difference is the border crisis would take longer to ruin us. Right now because of your shut down, people are suffering and losing everything NOW!! And you don't care!! https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorados-forests-at-risk-for-wildfires-due-to-government-shutdown/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab6a&linkId=62572813
Well he got Korea to stop launching missiles, he gotten Korea to release hostages, he got Korea to return our fallen soldiers, tax cuts for US citizens, more jobs, brought back jobs that past administrations shut down, prison reform for people that gets out of prison. Ect. But i think keeping us from going to war with North Korea and stopping the missiles flying our way was priority, don't you?
Well lets see now. How high did it rank when you dodged the draft 5 Times?
Well our airport are in danger so that defending our country Your hard to deal with god help you're putting our country in danger.
Well prisons have walls and they get plenty of drugs in. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm not scared of anyone crossing the border to seek a better life. A white guy in a MAGA hat with a confederate flag on his truck scares me tho.
Well said Sir, Donald J. Trump
Well said bye someone that never served
Well said!!
Well we c u didn't Photoshop your profile pic.... Lol
Well you have the people behind you ... it‚Äôs wall or bust
Well you're surely NOT defending the people in it
Well, I guess we'll just have to continue defending our borders, just like we have been this whole time.  Bummer!  I guess you really wanted that Re-Election Wall, didn't you?
Well, UK kind of does. It hasn't gone so well at all. Hahaha
Well, actually Trump, you just want a monument to feed your ego. Not happening
Well, actually.....  TRUMP IS FRAYING NERVES INSIDE THE PENTAGON  Washington (CNN) ‚Äî Two years into his presidency, Donald Trump is fueling unprecedented uncertainty and anxiety inside the Pentagon. In private conversations over the past month, many of them unsolicited, more than a dozen key military officers, enlisted personnel and senior civilians have expressed worry and concern to CNN. None of the officials have spoken publicly about this, as military law prohibits active-duty personnel from criticizing a sitting president. It's not just Trump's unpredictable decision making that has officials on edge, it's also his penchant for politicizing the military‚Äî something that's come into focus in recent months as he's struggled to fulfill his campaign promise to crack down on immigration and build a border wall. His decision to draw down troops in Syria and his claims that ISIS is defeated have also rankled military commanders who felt it wasn't well thought out. Some of the highest-ranking officers say there is a new atmosphere of unease inside the Pentagon, particularly among some of the most senior ranks, over the President's inclination to use the military to achieve certain partisan policy objectives. Behind the scenes officials are trying to keep it all at bay. "The amount of time we have to spend making sure our statements and what we say is apolitical is astronomically higher than ever before," one senior military officer told CNN. If commanders order the troops to perform a mission for reasons that are political ‚Äî rather than based on national security grounds ‚Äî the fundamental nature of the US military is changed, several officials worry. That line has already been crossed in the minds of some over the issue of sending troops to the border. It could become even more of a problem should the President decide to declare a national emergency to gain access to Defense Department funds to build the wall. R E A D  O N....  https://cnn.it/2FFdNbG .
Well, after lining my own pockets of course. Mueller is coming!
Well, as pence said: they‚Äôve caught 17,000 ppl trying to enter illegally. Seems the boarder we have now works just fine.
Well, except for the treason part...
Well, going by the way you -or your staff- has suddenly started posting ralley-rhetoric multiple times per day on this FB page you knew your falsehood-filled con job speech didn't work.
Well, that is actually what you were elected to do...
Well, that's nice and dandy, but the original text was not written in English but Greek and most likely referred to a Shofar. These were also blown when the walls of Jericho fell. The passage you quoted is talking about the resurrection, not a wall in the US.  National pride is the beginning of Babylon. That is coming from someone who lives in Germany. ;)
Well, then it is obviously the goal of the democrats to weaken the US from within so that it's easier for them to let in illegal immigrants to vote for them and maintain their power :3
Well, you had better resign then. No?
Were getting sprayed like bugs. Stop the Chemtrails.
Western Europe basically has open borders and look at the chaos over there!! Millions of so-called refugees from africa & the middle east are flooding the European continent.
We‚Äôll gladly defend them. But we won‚Äôt pay $21 billion just to build the damn thing, plus billions per year in maintenance.   The answer is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.  Your popularity is dropping pretty quick. You might want to go ahead and accept defeat on this one. That‚Äôs what you get for trying to tack regulatory bills onto spending bills.  ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. - Nancy Pelosi
We‚Äôre nationing so hard right now.
We‚Äôve done alright so far üòï
We‚Äôve sustained this long. Your idea isn‚Äôt so awesome
What a BUFFOON! And that picture is HILARIOUS üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
What a JOKE!
What a change from the last guy.
What a fucking moron
What a goof....hope he goes to jail!
What a great gift it is to finally have a president who believes his most sacred duty as President of the US is to defend and protect America! #KAG! Behind you 10,000% #BuildThatWall
What a huge load of horseshit!
What a joke. Thank god he will soon be gone.
What a joke....
What a man, what a mighty, mighty man!
What a moron
What a pic! üïµ
What a rotten son of a bitch you people elected ! He could not get Mexico to pay for his ego wall now thousands of families are suffering. There is NO EXCUSE for a spoiled trust fund baby making working American suffer. IMPEACHMENT NOW!
What a stubborn idiot
What about all the people who voted him in?
What about all these white people doing these mass murders? In case you‚Äôre not paying attention Mr. Trump these mass murders are not coming for Mexico  and 911 wasn‚Äôt from Mexico.... lol Now you‚Äôre throwing a tantrum because the American people won‚Äôt pay for a wall that you promised Mexico would pay for even though they will just build tunnels or use ladders or sneak across the border now American people are not getting their paychecks but who cares because you‚Äôre taken care of.... I guess that‚Äôs what we can expect from a president who makes fun of handicapped people and is a womanizer and thinks our war veterans are not hero‚Äôs
What about banning guns from your country so your children and other children will have a safe country to live in
What about defending America from Russians? Your relationship with Putin is affecting your presidency and should try taking time apart... Putin is playing you
What about funding the Coast Guard..?
What about native Americans
What about selling us out to the Russians? Is that defending our nation?
What about the Chinese moon landing!
What about the People
What about the families that will be going without food.
What about the government's workers ?
What about the people...L I A R..Should they start to learn Russian !
What an  Idiot
What an ASSHOLE
What an absolute load of crap.  Americans want a solution not a symbol.  A wall may be part of the solution but it is far from THE solution.  Get with it and become a president and stop acting like you're one.
What an asshole !
What an asshole!
What are you blubbering about??  We don't 'stop being American' just becuse your dum wall don't get built. but by the end of it you will not be anymore.  You're a special kind of stupid, ain't ya?
What are you talking about?? Putin is in the White House.
What bullshit!!!
What comes through the legal entrances can be controled and tracked because they have security.  Things that come through an unsecure border can not.
What doing that fur
What ever happen  to Love Trump Hates  from The Left... Hypocrites!  There's NOTHING but  Hate coming from The Left.
What fancy propaganda pics he has.  Wonder if he has "propaganda pics" penciled in his schedule
What good are borders without a functioning government.
What happened to Mexico paying for the wall - You Trump are nothing more then a CRIMINAL LIAR & TRAITOR
What happens if the debt becomes unsustainable?
What have we been the last 250 years?
What he's done the last 2 years is fight for us and get issues resolved  it the democratic house keeps fighting him on it..dont blame Trump..blame your democratic party house.as even now more and more is being transparent that they are fighting him just because who he is..
What if Mexico builds steps on their side of the wall üòÇ
What if Mexico built stairs on their side of the wall? ü§£ü§£
What if Trump fined all the people who don't want the wall like Obama did eith Obamacare?  He'd get his funding with or without Democratic support. üòÇ
What if Trump fined everyone against his wall like Obama did with obamacare
What if his bone spurs hurt?
What is a nation?
What is a waste of money is to leave the border open but add more border agents and technology.Democrats want to make this a high tech game of the road runner vs Coyote.
What is going on????
What nation always over the top in every thing you do losers.
What nation are we if you continue to take away the funding that Americans need and depend on to live and survive in this country? The shutdown is doing damage to many families outside of the reported 800,000 federal employees! People are going unpaid, USDA loans for homes and so much more frozen, school‚Äôs reimbursements for feeding children of low income for free are at a halt and just beginning to feel the effects of the shutdown, families that struggle daily and live pay check to pay check that pay taxes and do all they can to provide are going to lose food stamps, College students that have school loan via government funding are now not getting funded and are at cross roads (impacting employees funding and students), people that work and need assistance for childcare are at cross roads doing to funding being at a halt, farmers, and so many more! This shut down is sickening to me to think it is the fix to ‚ÄúMaking America Great Again‚Äù. I am not for or against the wall but what I do know I am for is opening the government back up sooner than later as it is doing no favor to a huge some of Americans and their families!
What nation, Russia? You‚Äôre making Putin proud.
What on earth are you like üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
What planet do you live on troll?
What the Government should learn from this shutdown is that people ‚Äúdo not‚Äù have 6 months savings for an emergency!  That needs to be addressed!!
What the hell are you talking about?
What to do about the ones already here .We need to tax all money wired to Mexico.
What wall will defend us from Russian comrade in the White House?  ‚ÄúThe 362-53 vote registers formal House disapproval of plans to relax sanctions against companies controlled by Russian President Vladimir Putin ally, Oleg Deripaska, and comes despite last-minute appeals by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. A similar measure narrowly failed in the Senate this week, despite 11 Republicans breaking ranks to vote with Democrats.‚Äù
What's a wall going  to  do when they have tunnels? Air planes , and drones ???üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
What?
Whatever happened to the Mexico paying for the wall, now shutting down the government forcing US taxpayers to pay for the wall,at least ask Russia to pay for the wall to make you look good for a wile!!:)
What‚Äôs about Mexico paying for it?
What‚Äôs so bad about that ?!!!   TRUMP 2020üá∫üá∏
What‚Äôs the weather like is Moscow this time of year ‚ÄúMaxine‚Äù?
When are you going to start? Just curious.
When have we stopped defended our borders. Maybe when you closed the government?  Are you trying to create a problem so you can justify the wall.
When somebody offs this man. That‚Äôs when ‚ÄúAmerica will be great again‚Äù
When the US and North Korea negotiate disarmament talks, Trump 's term ends in 2020.
When you fail as a president, you become irrelevant
When you hate somebody  to  much then he getting better and better i think he is one of those
When's this guy gunna get taken out
Where are American Billionaires in three digits (Example Jeff....)?  One of them can sponsor the US southern  border wall and end this damn government shutdown.
Where can I get poster
Where dem yankees at
Where do you want to spend the money? Spend a little at the front end on a barrier or spend a lot at the back end on bureaucrazy and crime?
Where were you in 1968? Hanging with rich white Nixon folks in Chicago? Big Chicago been criminally infested with corrupt leaders as a standard for over a century.   Caravan? Send your church, not the military. Latin American asylum seekers are more Christian than Republicans pretend to be. BTW did you know that Canadians make up for most of the overstayed visas?   Your biggest error is overestimating his support. It is more than obvious that a majority of American disapprove of the President. The mid-terms are a fact he was a loser. His shutdown now has half of his supporters questioning if they would vote for him in 2020. He is falling apart, did you listen to his speech an hour ago about missile defense?
Wherever,  let make it,  the stupid wall, but let's open Government again, held we the Illuminates.
Which Nation are you defending? It seem your are doing everything you can to help Putin.
Which border are you defending when a once America banned corrupt man from Nigeria just visits your country? A man who in his case your country jailed two high top Americans.
Which country is that? Asking for a friend in Russia.
Which god are you thanking???
Which is exactly what Soro's   lib/left Dems and RINOs want to happen
Which nation is he talking about? Russia or the U.S.?
Which nation is the dotard talking about? Russia or the USA?

While Mr. Fibbs says that the furlough could be called a "strike"... this is the same person that has cheated workers/contractors out of their money all of his life.... and you expect him to care how you pay your bills and feed your family or how you get services from the government...WAKE UP!... the alarm has been sounding for two years and there are those act as though it has not been heard.... THIS RUSSIAN LACKY thinks being called a MF is a disgrace.... no, being a draft dodging, Trump U scammer, tax cheating, charity cheating, illegal immigrant hiring, P@#$y grabbing, name calling of AMERICAN football players SOB's, wife cheater(x3-that we know of),prostitute paying, daily liar, family separating, children caging and a disgrace and embarrassment to Americans is far worse than a MF... that would might even be too good for him. His PUBLIC conduct would get our children expelled from school for ever... If our great county of America has to suffer over ego and stupidity, no one in Congress or the Executive branch should get a paycheck-seems a lot of them are or could end up on jail anyway(they will be provided for-now that is funny in a sad way).........MF definition.. a despicable or very unpleasant person or thing., a person or thing of a specified kind... REPUBLICANS, Democrats and Independents AND THERE ARE MANY GOOD REPUBLICANS(MANY unfortunately MISLEAD)...STAND UP AND BE COUNTED...rant over -nough said for the "moment".FLOOD YOUR CONGRESSMAN'S OFFICE WITH CALLS=load up their email.... SPEAK OUT! Americans should not have to pay for his stupidity let alone his dumb ass wall....he is a sniveling twitt..just think about who is representing you...
While the hush-money playoffs are more salacious, Trump Org‚Äôs *willful and secret* reimbursements to Cohen also included $50,000 that Cohen spent on a technology company for CAMPAIGN-related work.ü§®  CLEAR felony per campaign-finance law and NOT a ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù expense.üôÑ
While we leave our seas and airs open like a 2 dollar hooker
While you just give away everything to the Russians instead!
While you starve the citizens, much like Putin and Kim Jong-un are doing.  When do you start murdering your political enemies and the LGTB community?  You are already complacent in the murder of journalists.

Why and how is it, that we the workingman get little back in taxes, but if youre an illegal you collect up to $25,000 if not more on a tax refund. This tax system is broken and needs fixed NOW !!!
Why are people so STUPID?!?  Republicans complain that Democrats voted FOR border security repeatedly, but now that it's Trump, they are voting against it. If Democrats voted for it before, where did this ridiculous LIE that they support "open borders"? Do you people even LISTEN to ANYTHING?!? And, as point of FACT, Democrats have voted FOR border security this time as well. They just won't let Trump waste BILLIONS of taxpayer dollars on his vanity project. Unlike Republicans, the Democrats are actually holding Trump accountable for being an idiot. And Trump and his sheep are constantly whining that Obama "lied", and yet you hypocrites don't have the slightest problem with the fact that Trump CAMPAIGNED on taxpayers NOT PAYING FOR THE WALL, ANY OF YOU REMEMBER THAT?!? His constant "Mexico will pay for it", and his current "Mexico IS paying for it......indirectly" bullshit was obviously NEVER going to happen.... But whatever happened to his rallying cry of NO AMERICAN TAXPAYER MONEY WILL GO TO PAY FOR THE WALL, I GUARANTEE IT?  Clearly, just MORE PROOF that his word, just like the "man" himself, isn't worth a damn thing.
Why are the cartels building tunnels if walls don't work?
Why are you so fucking retarded? He was voted into office by the people, dumbass.
Why are your fingers long and your skin toned whitened?
Why aren't Texans along the border more interested in building miles and miles of walls along more than a 1000 miles of unfenced border? Land ownership issues?
Why aren‚Äôt the taxpayers vote on this issue?? It‚Äôs their tax dollars paying for it!! Why not pay the unpaid government workers with the money paid to the crooked politicians??!
Why can't people see how true this statement is???  We have the best country in the world and people want to come here! But, to keep it great we need to know whose coming here, their background, if they are criminals, killers etc.!!! Other countries have really strict rules who get to come and live in their countries!! We must do the same or we will be overrun and lose what has made our country great!!!
Why can't you work for citizens insteed you are busy working russians
Why did you imbeciles care so much about Hillary's emails and you don't care about Ivanka's emails and her use of a private email server? Why did you care so much about Hillary having friends in high places and you don't care about Trump owing Russian Mob $650 Millon and his "relationships" with an evil, murderous dictator like Putin? Secret meetings. Spies in our White House? Why did you all go crazy about Benghazi but don't care about the 15 people and 4 servicemen who lost their lives on Syria yesterday? Why????
Why did you let bump stocks get banned? Don't act like we conservatives didn't notice.
Why didn't tRump do something about it when he had the House & Senate behind him for over two years???   Why has his ridiculous wall suddenly become a crisis perpetrated by Democrats???  Why isn't Mexico paying for it like HE promised they would???
Why didn't the Republicans give you the money for the wall for the two years they controlled the House and the Senate?
Why didn't trump propose this border wall at anytime duri g the first 2 years of his presidency  when the Republicans controlled both House and Senate? ü§î

Why don't you defend the 800,000 federal employees whose lives you a ruining with your infantile shutdown? Border security and your wall are two different things.
Why don't you get a real job!
Why don't you go to the RUSSIANS to get more money asshole god you suck
Why don't you just think this through? The wall doesn't work! ICE cut through it with a hand saw. Electronics, drones, and boots on the ground, are the only way to protect this border.
Why don't you pay attention to things that actually matter?
Why don't you start tobrun the country instead of building walls. Control don't need a wall.
Why don‚Äôt all you Trumpets show your support during the shutdown and work for free?

Why is your picture edited to have a longer finger?

Why not just make it a felony with a minimum of 30 years in prison for employers (or anyone) that hire illegals.
Why only you who come with such idea
Why should I leave when the #1 argument for those coming is "stay and fix your own country"? Your arguments arent even consistent with each other. Should I flee bc I dont like the state of my country or should I stay and try to fix the problems? Which is it, buddy?
Why should they?So Trump can build a worthless wall?
Why spend hundreds of billions abroad to "protect" the USA if an invasion can easily occur from the south?
Why the delay on implementing sanctions on Russia, and lack of funding for a cyber security task force to prevent further election hacking?
Why then, did you not defend your nation when called and instead manufactured bone spurs that didn't exist?
Why this man look like he just appointed the new manager of Crystal Palace Colin Charlie
Why you say that?
Why? It's a waste of money and wont do anything more than border patrol is doing now. If there is a section of the wall not being supervised anyone can go over or under it.
Will Titus That might be one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve heard
Will c when were homeless without pay but still have to be at work by 4. Trump 2020 all the way but boss you give me a check and I help protect this county I can't do it on E.
Will you please stop telling lies. Democrats don't want open borders. They want border security just like you. Why don't you sit down like a real man president and work with the other branches of Government? You would be surprised at what you can accomplish without bullying, threatening, or being vengeful.  We need a leader not, a toddler. Get over your tantrum and get these people back to work. They are suffering. Tell your Senate majority leader to put those bills to the floor fbor a vote. Please start working for the people. They need to get back to work!
Will you prosecute the radical islamic terrorist who tried to blow you up to the fullest extent, or do you think he has a spare get out of jail free card from Obummer's fake presidency..
William French I'll repeat ,  Preparation "H"  use it liberally, it's gonna be a long 6 more years for you losers................
William French wow, I hope you never need God because this is honestly the best thing you can say to a person, trust me I know all too well. God bless America and God bless President Trump!!!!
William Taylor waaa! Get over it and stand up to humpty dumpty trumpty
Winning everyday!!!!!
Wish it was the Democrats....#walkaway
Wish others felt that way
Wish the UK had a leader that cared for the country and people like DT
Wish we had him instead of our prime minister
Wish you'd spend as much time defending us as you do Russia.
Wished I knew what 316 of you morons find so funny, he's exactly right.
With hold pay from Congress and Senate so they will get the job done. If others don't get paid neither should they
With our president 100% he has been the only president that cares about our country and citizens. üëçüèªüëçüèªüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
With you 100% President Trump time to settle all loop holes & build the wall/ barrier üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
With you 100% Sir.  Stand your ground!
With you President Trump
With you President Trump.
With you and your friends do you always put yourself first or are you kind to your friends so they will be there for you later on?
Withhold paychecks of the senate as they are federal employees!  Then see how long they. Avoid meeting at the White House for talks....
Withholding pay from CBP is a failure to defend our borders.
Without a functioning government, we've pretty much already ceased to be a nation.
Wonder why the DNC was trying to delay the state of the union? Are they afraid Trump will get direct media coverage, or is Disney still fine-tuning their new Ginsburg animatronic?
Word Mr. President! Thank you for being brave enough to take on this important matter!! Build that wall, immigration reform, stop the drugs, stop human trafficking!!
Words from one who dodged the draft....
Worley Michael Bwhahahahahahahahaha
Worley Michael I'm not even a Christian lol..I'm pagan to be honest..I was just stateing a simple fact..creation can't see what's on the mind of a creator
Worley Michael If you take all the dead people off and illegals he did better start doing home work.
Worley Michael Proof-read your post so it makes some sense or is that how they talk in Mexico?
Worley Michael You teach us....................the comment expressed a desire to see the anti-security Demos be VISIBLY seen along side (or, underneath) their own public remarks, ON RECORD of their "commitment" to this nation's security.  Probably not on your list of expertise either, but this President just hosted the national champ football team..................founding fathers probably omitted that function....................whadya think?
Worley Michael comrade. I served my country. Did u?
Worley Michael how is that logical when a barrier will limit areas for entry..so yes a barrier is part of border security..even border agents have said many times there needs to be a barrier along the border..and these agents are at these borders everyday..they know what they need..you think you know more on what's needed than these agents working on the border
Worley Michael it has nothing to do with religious ppl..it's simple .for years ppl in office have said that we needed border security for years ppl in office have talked about and passed laws for immegration yet they don't enforce these laws..we are ppl that want a solution in place to Henderson illeaglly entering this country..
Worley Michael it surely is part of it.  Why are some of you so ignorant and never use the brain that God gave you?
Worley Michael like I said you got nothin...go milk your unicorn and clean your room before you mom gets home from turnin tricks.
Worley Michael we shall see.
Worley Michael you still got nothin.
Worried the rest of you family won't be able to come over? Yeah thats a hard thought to think about üòÜ
Worst president of all times
Wouldn't surprize anyone if trump announced he was giving the "State of the State" speech from Moscow. Putin would stand with him to insure trumps safety.
Wow really so you going to belittle heavy set people. Some people can't lose weight and don't eat that much they have physical issues with their body that makes them retain weight. You sound just as ignorant as your party
Wow the lengths these people go. I'm legit sorry for your husbands
Wow you look great! Must feel good to lose all that weight! Congratulations
Wow you‚Äôre hands look so extra towards tiny in this poster. You need a better graphic designer.
Wow!
Wow, you believe all that Crap don't you ! Trump is NOT smart ,you Get that !
Wrong (trump voice ) as long as we have people willing to fight for this great nation will always be a nation .
Wrong again trumpy...  if a country allows foreign hostile countries to buy their so called president and interfere with our democracy and elections and instruct that so called president to cause chaos and division....then we cease to be a free country....its time for you to go back to your  mother land...Russia
Wrong again.  The highest duty of the President is described in the Oath you took.  "... preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, against all enemies, foreign and domestic ...".    But you keep violating the Constitution and even attempt to undermine it.  The First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the emoluments clause, all have come under attack by you.    So how about you stop lying and start at least pretending to fulfill your oath.
Wrong is easy.  Doing the right thing is hard.  I admire your strength.
Wrong, Comrade Bullshit! No one believes your lyin' cheatin' mouth. Go directly to jail.
Wrong, check your facts, you sound like trump.
Wrong, defending and preserving the rights of US citizens is.
Wtf
Wtf over a fukin wall nigga u pay for it
Xenia Shust so...
Y all is üêë
Y'all know it's not up to Trump and he works for Putin right
Y'all know what will  finally stop caravans of illegals from coming into our country  ? Lots of ammo . Drop a few and the others will get a clue they aren't wanted.
Y'all really trust that a wall will save us? Lmao #ImpeachTheCrook
YALL ALL GONE DIE FUCKING WITH TRUMP üòÇ

YES WE NEED THE WALL
YES!
YES! MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. USA, USA, USA!!
YES...and that's why we love you and voted for you and will vote for you again.
YOU ARE A FAILURE SINCE BEFORE YOU TOOK YOUR OATH !
YOU DANG RIGHT SIR ....AND THE TSA DONT NEED TO BE TOUCHING PEOPLES NO NO SPOTS ....................
YOU GODDAM FOOLS! GUESS WHAT ASS!!! PAY ATTENTION: Trump TOLD Cohen to LIE to Congress! And it was backed up by ELECTRONIC surveillance! #MICDROP #Treason #Collusion
YOU MUST BE A TERRY BEAN  SUPPORTER.....THAT  OBAMA HAND PICK TO WRITE THE BATHROOM LAW.....LOL
YOU'RE A FELON AND TRAITOR.
YOU'RE RIGHT AS USUAL PRESIDENT TRUMP
YOU'RE SUCH A LOSER AND A MORON!!!!!!!!!!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£  NFL icon Michael Strahan just showed up Trump on Good Morning America over his fast food debacle  With the controversy over President Trump‚Äôs on-the-cheap fast food feast for the victorious Clemson Tigers football players briefly crowding the government shutdown, the border wall, and the latest revelations in the Mueller investigation out of the news cycle, a lot of people were obviously insulted on behalf of the players whom they thought deserved to be treated with as much dignity during a White House visit as any prior group of winning athletes.  The Trump administration used the excuse of the government shutdown as the reason for why no White House kitchen staff was available to make a proper meal for the visiting players, forcing Trump to pay for the reception out of his own pocket, but his parsimonious purchase of burgers, chicken nuggets, and fries from major fast food chains ‚Äîrather than ordering takeout from a catering firm or proper restaurant ‚Äî displayed a contempt for the college student-athletes and a miserly approach to forking over his own cash that did sit well with Michael Strahan, the former NY Giants defensive end who is now a co-host on ABC‚Äôs Good Morning America.  Tell Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer to stand firm. Don't give in to Trump's ransom demand for a stupid wall!  Strahan decided to outclass and outspend the president with a generous on-air invitation to the team to attend a sumptuous feast of lobster and caviar at GMA‚Äôs Times Square studios, a feast that he vowed to pay for personally, describing it as the proper meal that they deserve.
YOUR A DISCUSTING UNCLE TOM
YUUPP !!
Ya Mitch
Ya do know he doesn't post his own social media...or are you just grasping?
Ya one pager lmfao
Ya take your 5 billion & build afford able houses along border. Call Trumps Border. B the first 2 solar wind free frash water.
Yall are all over the place with this ü§¶
Yay President Trump!
Yea but at a cost of the American federal workers they have nothing to do with you holding there paychecks. Plus you are not giving them any incentive for this just not paying them. lol
Yea that's all you selfish people care about money and yourselves. As long as you're wealthy no one else matters. Just forget about the imprisoned kids who were taken away from the families and all the families that were seperated in general. We are all humans. We all have feelings. Who cares where we come from. And some of you need to do your history lessons because we are all foreigners the only real "Americans" are the native americans who were here first. Thank you
Yeaaaaaaatrump 2020
Yeah
Yeah I noticed how Canada built a wall.  And I travelled all over Europe and you couldn't go anywhere without running into a wall.  Even Russia has a wall.  Wait a minute.  Nope, they all have borders with no walls.  How can that be.  Do they know something we don't?   Check your facts.
Yeah I noticed how Canada built a wall. And I travelled all over Europe and you couldn't go anywhere without running into a wall. Even Russia has a wall. Wait a minute. Nope, they all have borders with no walls. How can that be. Do they know something we don't? Ask your Russian buddy how they keep people out.  Not with a wall.
Yeah I think the people going to food banks right now for food would disagree with you.
Yeah Mexico and Canada will finally invade your country!
Yeah cause apparently getting the people their money isn't
Yeah so make all the middle class and poor people suffer then right?Because it‚Äôs their fault that the stupid wall won‚Äôt be built
Yeah you're right if your name was not Donald jackass Trump
Yeah, ....well how about defending our borders from your russian counterparts
Yeah, Russia world
Yeah, but if you build a wall, how are the Dems going to get the voters necessary to secure Texas and Florida's electoral college votes?
Yeah, good luck with that üòÇ
Yeah, sure. Anything you say........is a lie!
Yeah. He's the best bullshit artist ever. Even his paintbrush is made from asshole hair.
Yeah.... right. Keep watching CNN.
Yeah....might be back to horse and buggy....stage Coach travels agAin...
Yeah...you elected MORE CORRUPT DEMOCRATS....THE PARTY THAT KILLED KENNEDY. .BECAUSE HE WAS GIVING THE BLACKS TOO MANY RIGHTS. ..THE DEMOCRAT PARTY CREATED THE KKK TO INTIMIDATE BLACKS INTO VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS. .UNDER THE FEAR OF DEATH, IF THEY DIDN'T.....WHY DO THEY STILL FUND AND SUPPORT THE. KKK TO THIS DAY ??....BECAUSE THEY DID SUCH A GREAT JOB ON THE BLACKS.. JUST THINK WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR THE DEMS, WITH WHITES, HISPANICS,.ETC....DEMOCRATS ARE ALL RACISTS
Yep
Yep Why does Nancy Polosi have a wall around her house ?
Yep! Broken record.
Yep, want to make sure it's weak enough so Russia can continue to penetrate it long after you're in jail.
Yep. If we dont build this wall, the Mexicans will defeat our Army, our Navy, our Air Force, our Border Patrol Officers, and everyone in between. From there, they will caravan straight to Washington and steal the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Next, they'll establish communications back to Mexico and thus the United States of America will surrender. All because of a wall. Great thinking guy. Here, have 5 billion dollars for that wall thatll take 10 years to built. You'll likely be dead before then because of your age and health, but thats okay, because we'll have a wall. We'll make sure to tell the next group of pinheads that this wall is crucial to the survival of the American country.   Dont you worry your toupee over this, sir.
Yes
Yes  build the wall
Yes !
Yes , Can‚Äôt wait until the 30 days are over new changes!
Yes Boss
Yes I agree #realDonaldTrump #buildthewall
Yes I agree very strongly. There is the legal way do get to America. My president Mr trump is our fist good good president in a long time. And if you don't see that your not for the rule of law or for America. You just want to destroy our nation.
Yes I do.  I'm not a traitor.  Bet you can't say the same.   Ypour boy stinks of treason.  And now you do too.
Yes Jesse Lee Billings Jr
Yes Lawrence and Karen, they can still use boats or tunnels. However a fence is the biggest barrier to discourage and reduce people from entering illegally.
Yes Master commander in chief. You are absolutely correct.
Yes Mr President
Yes Mr President, that‚Äôs your 1st duty!üíïüíïüíïüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª

Yes Mr. President you are right and you care for the people and America's security.
Yes Nancy and Pelosi need to do that,
Yes Sir!! That's right!! Thank you President Trump!!
Yes because actually running the country isnt in his job description...dont have to run the country if its shutdown. ü§î
Yes build the wall then we can start fixing other problems.  Keep up the good work sir
Yes defend our borders. But Mr. president how much longer on the government shut down?  The first of March it will start effecting housing. It shouldn't effect anything.  If it effects anything at all  take pay cuts in all government officials.
Yes genius,. continue to love and pray for your blasphemous, unwitting, inept bungling goofus as he single handedly dismantles the organizations that have protected the free world from aggression since 1945.  Hooray for his restocking the swamp with anti environmentalists sucked up from the bowels of corporate America.  Most importantly thank the Buffoon and Chief for attempting to create a space force that already exists and finally, for attempting to build a wall constructed from hate and unmitigated bullshit on our southern border.üòµ
Yes indeed
Yes indeed...! Stay the course Mr President. God Bless You.
Yes it is and Thank You for keeping it number 1. ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üí™üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è

Yes it is! And you sir are the only who seems to care.
Yes it is.  If only you would really do your duty, instead of trying to divide the nation with paranoia
Yes sir
Yes sir it is! Thank you so much for putting our country & the safety of American citizens first! Also, thank you for taking the time to meet with all the Angel moms who have PERMANENTLY been separated from their children and not ignoring or hiding from them like Nancy Pelosi did! God bless you sir for keeping your campaign promises and for standing firm on doing what is right! I know its been hard with the Democrats constantly opposing everything you work so hard to achieve for us, but God is with you! He sees it all, the way they treat you and how the MSM constantly lies and deceives! Many Americans are on your side as well and so many of us keep you, your beautiful family, and all those who are working for the good of this nation in our prayers! You are truly the peoples President!! We love you President Trump!! Keep fighting the good fight! #Trump2020Landslide üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏

Yes yes yes yes build wall defund  legislators

Yes!
Yes! And "Support and Defend" means absolutely nothing to the Democrats their leadership and some Republicans. Disgraceful!
Yes! Build the wall! You'll see the capability of these people to have tunnels and big enough ladders to cross over by the time finish the wall...
Yes! Thank you
Yes! Thank you mr. President for knowing what your duties are. Too many years we've spent with presidents who didn't know or didn't care.
Yes! We‚Äôve got your back, Mr. President!
Yes! üôãüèª
Yes!!  Stand strong! Don't give in to them.  We need border security!

Yes, absolutely true ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yes, amen!!!
Yes, and so says our constitution. Problem is, its not their constitution.
Yes, and thank you
Yes, and why do US citizens have to pay for passports to visit OTHER countries, but Democrats allow and welcome anyone to cross the border regardless. Insane.
Yes, as President and Commander in Chief the safety and security of the Nation is your top priority.  Not handouts and not making friends.  Stay tough on this issue, we need it!  We won't see another no-nonsense president like you in my lifetime.
Yes, because if the last 200 years of US history has taught us anything (and I know it has not taught most of you Trump supporters anything), it's that the US needs borders to survive.. How stupid are you Americans? You have spent the last 200 years expanding your influence all over the globe, invading border after border.. and now you have the audacity to ask for a wall to keep the very people you have invaded and schemed against, out? What a bunch of hypocritical morons.. millions of Americans are on the verge of homelessness and destitute, yet all you care about is the "dangerous" immigrants..
Yes, drain the swamp and Build the wall, deport all illegals.
Yes, it is!
Yes, it is.  And now you have to fight the left-wing loonies too.
Yes, please defend us against the crooked establishment elected officials in DC and their cronies.  Difficult to drain the swamp when you are up to your ass in alligators..
Yes, so stop devoting all your attention to border control which is much improved in recent years. Your only interest there, as anyone with a brain knows, is to fulfill a dumb campaign promise to build an ineffective wall. Pay attention to what matters, you mango Mussolini.
Yes, that is the biggest concern in America today! üôÑ #liberalthoughtprocess
Yes, that's right. All other countries are completely surrounded by walls, yup, sure. ;)
Yes, they are suffering. This shutdown is exactly what the Republicans have been working towards for decades. They want all government programs outsourced to private enterprise. Don't expect this shutdown to end.
Yes, true speech.
Yes.
Yes. Rational people agree. Now do it,
Yes...and only dummycrats don't believe that!! Build the wall Sir..please!!
Yesss!
Yet the Coast Guard and the Border Protection Employees are not getting paid due to a partial Govt Shutdown...seems a bit hypocritical - Open the government and then work on negotiating for the border security but do not hold all these employees hostages in the negotiations.
Yet you are failing to pay members of the coast guard, TSA, and border patrol agents. You‚Äôre a #Failure #UnfitForOffice
Yet you want to remove sanctions on Russia. How is that defending our country.
Yet your a fucking draft dodger!!!!!!
Yo Trump inbox  me   I help u build dat wall for 80$ a hour
Yolanda Martinez Lesser ... I am so sorry.     üòì

You  are  so  right  President Trump,  keep  up  the  great  work  you  are  doing  for  America  and  the  American people,  thumbs  up  Mr.  President,  yes!!!!!!!!!!
You  don‚Äôt care  about  the  borders or  the  health  of  our  Nation;  you  only  care  about  yourself.    Narcissistic  dimwit.
You ARE the man, Sir!
You Bet!
You DO know he's going to prison for being a Russian traitor right? There will never be a wall.
You People Do Understand That This Wall Isn't Being Built To Keep Immigrants In, Its to Keep U.S Citizens In & Contained ... Let Martial Law Began Oh Ya Mr.Trump Nice Way To Fake You're Own Death What An Assassination üôÑüíÅ
You Rock President Trump! #trumpdrivers2020
You The Man That Can! KAG‚òÜ
You a billionaire that‚Äôs so generous , how about you put the 5 billion since your so worried? Oh your not really a billionaire ü§î
You act like we don‚Äôt do anything at all.   Rhetoric
You actually think the president can put TVs inside congress?     You really don‚Äôt understand how a republic works do you?
You all think they get paid weekly, you are fools, they get paid once a year.
You and your family are  a National security threat, you all will sell America's secrets to the highest bidder. You all are treasonous traitor conmen.
You are RIGHT, President Trump.
You are a JOKE! Open the Government!
You are a Nim Rod!
You are a Russian operative!  The KGB said it would destroy the USA from the inside and you're how they're doing it!
You are a SMELLY FUCKING TURD. I hope you rot in jail and never see the light of day. POS
You are a big fat slob
You are a disgrace, resign #TrumpShutDown #TurdNChief
You are a disgrace.
You are a fool and you think your supporters are fools, too.
You are a fool.  You think lies are truth and that truths are lies.  I am very thankful that the majority of people in our great country are not as foolish as you are.
You are a friggin idiot !
You are a fucking joke to America! Thanks for shuttig down everything and fucking over hard working American's. You are a douch!
You are a liar and a fraud.  Your administration is an American disgrace and a global embarrassment.  Go to jail soon. üëãüèªüòé #MAGA
You are absolutely right and that is EXACTLY what the DEMOCCULT Party and the rest of the bought-and-paid-for party puppets want to happen!  AMERICA FIRST!  AMERICA STRONG! AMERICA FOREVER! <3 <3 üá∫üá∏üéöüôè BUILD THE WALL!!
You are an empty ballon that just wants to be pretty.
You are an idiot. üñïüèªü§°
You are aware that the Mayor of Flint took money given to her to fix the water and donated it to a super PAC right?
You are beacon of light in a world of morons good for you
You are breaking up the nation-----Russia ,Saudi, North Korea and china are all joining together because of a reckless man you are.  Your putting all the american people at risk.  A man who knows it all is going to be the destroyer
You are ceasing our nation either way it goes.
You are conjuring a crisis where there is none.  We do not need a fucking wall, you moron.  How about using that money to make sure poor seniors are cared for, homeless veterans are cared for, our vulnerable children cared for.  If you wsnt tge wall that bad then maybe ypu shouldn't have given the billionaire's club such huge tax breaks.
You are correct my President. You need not have porous borders , America must weed out criminals by ensuring the proper procedures are followed while entering.
You are correct, and that makes the Democratic actual end game very clear.
You are definitely not interested in AMERICA
You are destroying our country , you orange shithole.   Not my president!!!!!
You are doing a GREAT and really hard job with all the internal enemies you have to contend with in the USA.My family and I will definitely vote a straight Republican ticket in 2020 as we need bout 8 more years of President Trump at least. Dems are really indifferent  to the suffering and of USA citizens and do not care bout their safety nor  their welfare.
You are doing a great job
You are doing a great job President Trump. Keep up the great work thank you for putting Americans first . And BUILD THAT WALL üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
You are doing a horrible job for Americans. End the shutdown, let people go back to work!
You are doing the right thing, President Trump!  Stand strong!   Doing the right thing is not usually the most painless thing, as any of us know.  We are with you!
You are doing what we elected you to do!  Build the wall and drain the swamp.  Keep it up!
You are failing us who supported you, by damaging our second amendment, if this continues I will not vote for you
You are going to jail üéâüéâüéâ
You are losing us sir. I could not disagree more. Open the government and pay these citizens. This shutdown is political suicide.
You are making us less of a nation you traitor.
You are not doing a good job . Time to lockdown the Democrats no movement out of the country until the wall is built
You are not under attack by Mexico what in the world are you talking about !! All you are looking for is to line your pockets.... if you were concerned with the borders why did you wait 2 years????
You are our HERO üçÄüíö
You are right Mr. Trump
You are right!!
You are right. We need the Wall. We are with you all the way 150%. Go for it.
You are so fixated on this damn border that you could care less about anything else that is going on. That is all you are talking about non stop. The majority of the people dont give a rats ass about your damn border wall and are sick and tired of hearing about it. There is no crisis at the border. You are just making it up in hopes that you can continue to brainwash your supporters. The majority of the people regardless of their political stance want the government shutdown to end. YOUR SHUTDOWN !! The majority of the people dont believe a damn word you say. You are a mental case  A true Narcissist at work. Why dont you resign like you make others in your administration do?? You are not winning. You are losing and you know it.Play Video
You are so right! üëç
You are stuck with her for 2 years, just like we are with Trump.
You are stupid..plz stfu
You are such a joke.  Meanwhile, TSA agents and air traffic controllers work without pay.  And how is it that this keeps us safe?
You are such a pathetic Con-Artist!!!! Can't you see that all you have following you is a bunch of ignorant REDNECKS?
You are the biggest threat to our national security!!!
You are the cause of the destruction of the United States of America and will fall under your rule, Trump
You are the greatest danger to our country.
You are the only politician working for the people to protect our country.
You are the president of a wrestling mother
You are the single biggest threat to our nation in history.
You are the worst president and human being I've ever seen. F*** you honestly
You better start defending then.  Why are you fixated on the wall?  You do know that border security measures include added personnel, drones and smart tech...why not use those?
You better worry what's coming through our airports and ports of entry
You can add cheese to my burger ..tax me baby I want that tax . immigration is your yelling for da wall
You can defend the nation and borders without a stupid wall. Give it up.
You can defend ur borders but not building a wall fence! If each country builds a wall, what do u think will happen?
You can try and vote him out in 2020 if you so badly want to remove him.
You can't argue with that!
You can't defend borders with a wall idiot.  Try the solutions offered by the Democrats and quit being such a stubborn little boy who can't get his way.
You cant 'defend' your own nation while undermining the very intelligence agencies sworn to protect it. You've lied all your life and gotten away with it. Now you work for us and its all caught up to you. Time to pay the piper...and his name is Mueller. A very capable republican who is putting country first over party, over his own interests and his own pockets.

You claimed ISIS was defeated. They definitely aren't!
You could have done it while you had control of the house
You cowardly communist sellouts need to be met in the streets in a real stand up fight. Let's see how smart and brave you are then. Most are sick of your cowardly use of a weaponized leftwing media, minorities, border security and hate for Trump voters and the constitution. You go against everything that I took an oath to defend, clown. Frankly, I think you're a low life POS and a complete waste of oxygen. You want socialism and communism so much, move out. Because you're going to remove the constitution and inject socialism here over my dead carcass.
You crossed the border from the spiritual realm to the physical realm!!! You did it Solo without any help from the government. You developed the awareness of thoughts and consciousness!! And because you are a divine being you have Sovereignty and Freewill and most valuable currency:Time!!! You created your own Reality!!!! No borders just space and time!!! Maybe a lesson to all who is interested in following the wealthy elite lifestyle? Its the ignorance of masses that's makes the 1 percent wealthy?
You disgusting waste of oxygen.

You doing great job President Trump and we all support you may God bless you thank you President Trump for a great job‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüíùüôèüíùüëç
You don't give no s--- to Big Don.
You don't have open borders. Stop being an idiot.
You don't have to be Einstein to know that barriers work.- Border Patrol say a wall is critical to secure the southern border - #America1STüíØ #FundTheWall üá∫üá∏Ô∏è üéØüíØ
You don't want to defend America , you want to defend your Ego !!
You dont have to LIKE him to see he is trying to save this country And keep it safe for ALL....
You dont know about votes huh? Liberals are so dumb!
You don‚Äôt need a degree from trump university to see that Donald Trump and his buddies are going to make a lot of money off this wall if they can get it going. #CheneyHalliburton
You ever lived near the border. I actually know a retired Border patrolmen
You get it, walls don't work anyway.
You got elected on lies
You got the power.
You had a year and change with a Republican trifecta and you choose to start the border wall as soon as Democrats tske control? What's your angle?
You had the house and senate for two years. Now, the wall is priority? How about opening up the government so workers can get paid!!!!!
You had the past 2 years with GOP in control of the House, the Senate and the Presidency...why is the wall so important now that the Dems have control of the House? #Distraction #PowerPlay
You have a funny way of defending Americans, by keeping the government shut down putting many of their lives in jeopardy.
You have already stopped us from being a nation
You have balls Trump!! All of this is hilarious to us.  So glad you are standing your ground against yhe Dumocrats!
You have been robbed of your Presidential powers to do anything else to save our country.  Thank you for trying.  Go home and be with your family.  America is over.
You have literally made us more unsafe by throwing a temper tantrum and shutting the government down!
You have many people hoping you don‚Äôt get week we know you are best president in long time
You have my 100% support! May God bless you, President Trump. MAGA!!
You have my full support Mr. President.... Trump 2020
You have my support Mr. President.
You have my support!!
You have no clue on how to protect Americans...biggest threat is ISIS and you want to withdraw troops from Siria, in the meantime 4 Americans lost their lives and you keep taking about your stupid wall...you are losing BIg!
You have now become a one trick dog
You have opened our eyes on how corrupt politicians are. Gas prices are at an all time low, unemployment all time low, I'm saving a lot of money on my land taxes..and I thank you for all of that. Washington is mad because you have shown the American people we don't need big government and you are hurting their purse strings. I can't see why anyone would vote for a crooked politician again.
You haven‚Äôt been a nation since 2016... you dont get called divider in chief for nothing you complete lunatic. If America gets attacked during your  shut down, it will be on you.
You hid from military combat, so how are you an expert on protecting the country?
You idiot
You just gonna make the drugs more expensive üòÇ
You just need a giant distraction from what's REALLY going on. #orangefraud
You keep rippin and roarin it Mr. President
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.  (Nation)
You knew damn well when you were campaigning on the fact that Mexico would pay you we're talking to the dumbest among us and you knew how you were going to try to get that wall paid for you miserable jackass
You know as Trump is really rich he could fund the wall himself if he truly did care as much as he claims.
You know he googled how to spell "cease".
You know the pic is photoshopped, right? They fixed his hair, made him thinner, and elongated his fingers.
You know what's way more important than the borders or a wall for mexico? To stop the military support for the king in saudi-arabia!!! Stop that madness, stop preventing the arabians from destroying the monarchy. You don't need that damn alliance with the king any longer, no reason to kill innocents and rebels who only try to free their nation from a mad king. If that monarchy is gone, then a lot of violence and danger will be gone soon too. Use your time and the position you got to make things right man.
You know why the Russians helped get their operative elected President?  So they could destroy the U.S from the inside!  Because of trump's tariffs the Russians are prospering!  They are now supplying China  instead of us and our farmers are on Government welfare!   Did trump and family ever bring THEIR businesses to the USA?  NO, THEY ARE ALL STILL IN CHINA and other Asian countries!  But it's OK NONE of them are included in the tariffs!
You left all the ports unguarded
You let 4 soldiers die in Syria. How can protect the country? Send your sons to war? You can say anything and stupid Americans believe it.
You like to make mountains out of molehills.
You look different. Is this you in the pic or Alec Baldwin? Since when do real public servants manipulate their photos to make them look better? But of course, you ARE the #FakePresident.
You look like an ABBA dancer
You made your fingers longer and photoshopped yourself thinner.  This would be hilarious if it weren‚Äôt sad.
You make me cry!
You mean besides eating cheeseburgers, watching Faux Noise, and tweeting?
You mean distracting while you crimes and treasonous acts are becoming clearer.
You mean like     "NORTH AMERICAN UNION"  SOON TO BE
You mean ‚Äúthe defense of you‚Äù President Bonespurs
You might want to focus on that legal defense...
You must be the people that's got it made already you forgot the people that work everyday who suffers out here but don't forget I asked the Democrats to go to the table and resolve this wall situation which day is right we do need to build a wall but the thing is is that we got to make sure that nobody is lining their pockets with money can you agree with me on that one
You must give your state of the union address at the capitol. Nancy House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is freaking out to the fact that she will get embarrassed on national TV at the biggest stage. Time for payback.
You need to be executed for treason.
You need to move to Canada.
You need to take yourself back where you came from and take your relatives with you.
You need to tell that to fucker trudeau
You never trumper's crack me up if you guys get what you want you're not going to be happy and you're going to be crying wake up America still the best place in the world that's why everybody wants to come here we've always had legal immigration
You only talking n talking,  doing nothing...worst president for USA
You paid to have polls rigged.  You dirty crook.
You pay my part jerk
You promised 200 times that Mexico is paying for the wall. Plus, why didn't you vote for it for the two years where you controlled the Senate and the house? Must not have been TOO important ya MORON!
You put a wall over our exonomy
You realize that Trump could have built the wall over the last two years without ANY democrat support don‚Äôt you. The wall could be funded already and in progress.
You really need a punch in the teeth, Trump! Any time, any place, chickenshit!
You seem to be doing a worse job at it than any President in modern American history!!  If you really believe in defending the US, you should resign, and make room for a real President; someone competent who can do the job.
You should also include healthcare üòë
You should be ashamed of the way you are representing the nation! The #TRUMPSHUTDOWN is using people's lives as political fodder. Resign now, before you drag us into ruin!
You should declare a national emergency  ! And pay the 800,000 people not getting paid . And stop the politicians pay that will not negotiate .
You should hold your breath while waiting for what  you asked for. It will make it happen faster for you.
You should just resign: it would protect our nation a whole lot.
You should start by not being a traitor that deserves to hang!
You should stop typing like you're six years old.
You shouldn't listen to fake news it will make you say stupid things.
You should‚Äôve got on here to correct all the lies Obama and.  Hillary Clinton  told
You spelled "profit" wrong.
You spelled offense wrong
You tell him President Trump
You told everyone that Mexico will pay for it. You even got the crowd to chant it. Now US has to pay for it and you are throwing your little tantrump.(Tantrum) LOL
You trash
You voted down the bill that would defend our borders because it didn't support your wall.
You want to open unsecured channels to people who leave their country, go to another country, "earn" money and send it back to the country they left behind , shallow lending sounds risky to me but the people that cause it are suspect at the very least, wait.... They're not American? $&#@!!?
You want to put up a wall by shutting down the government but yet the shutdown is hurting us. You don't care about us just your wall.  Did you even think of what all would happen. No more WIC no more help for families in need and even worse no more safety nets on the websites controlled by the government. This safety net helps stop hackers from getting our info.  People are working without pay and tons have been sent to stay home. You where all for us to have more jobs but yet now you have lowered that way more then ever now.  If you keep this shutdown going babys will go without milk kids will go without food. People will loose there homes and die from the cold.  Stop being so stubborn and stop this shutdown before things get worse. All you care about is the ones who make as much as you do.  Next time think and plan things out before you jump the gun.
You were given 40 billion over 2 years for border security...
You wouldn‚Äôt like my new shirt with Pres Trump on it if you don‚Äôt like this
You're a nation of Animals and no different to any terrorist organisation !  Sickos !!!
You're a special kind of dumb.
You're doing a great job of killing the country over this stupid wall. Congratulations
You're doing a great job, Mr. President. Stay strong,
You're either a Democrat or a Patriot you just cant be both
You're extremely uneducated, reading that travesty of a comment gave me a migraine.  No, Mexico isn't gonna pay for it. Get over it... Kathy Werbickiwere I  Oh no, you come back to the party. Did my awful truth make you angry... üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≥üò±
You're going to jail going directly to jail do not pass go do not collect $200
You're gonna feel betrayed when it's YOUR turn in the GULAG!
You're incompetent AF!  Your presidency is a fraud  #fakepresident
You're liar and crook trump
You're not even in America. Go troll somewhere else, hahaha!
You're right
You're strangling & suffocating America like a serial killer and apparently, American's are too dumb to object...
You're such a liar. And you're so pathetically weak. You let Ann Coulter tell you what to do...how disgraceful.
You're the best
You're the best, President Trump!  #MAGA !!
You're the man! I know you will get this done!  Proud to be an American!  Protect our borders PRESIDENT TRUMP!
You're the one we need the most defense from...
You've trolled 57 times.Chill out snowflake...
Your Administration LIED about how many children were taken away from their parents at the border! Thousands more than reported! Lies in every area of your Cabinet! Trump destroys everything he touches! EPA is not protecting from pollution. 800,000 Federal workers are in dire straights and may lose their homes or face eviction! Trump is a monster! A compulsive liar in this WH! Resign!
Your FENCE is:  1) INCOMPLETE  2) EASILY CLIMBED  3) EASILY DESTROYED  4) BUILT ABOVE EXISTING TUNNELS  5) Nothing but a waste of OUR tax dollars  You're a fucking JOKE.
Your President may be controversial but given the way the world is these days, to have a leader that's creating jobs, boosting your economy, and doing something about your national security, has to be the right man at this time don't you think?
Your a 5 deferment draft dodger
Your a joke you just want your % of the money
Your a joke!! https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-claims-immigration-judge-paychecks-as-court-morale-hits-a-historic-low/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab6a&linkId=62718789
Your a liar. Plain, simple and to the point.
Your a poet and don‚Äôt know it!!  We also don‚Äôt need the wall. Worry  about underground roads with sleeping quarters. .
Your a yuge FAILURE stop fear mongering ......your only trying to throw bloody meat to your base ....to create a smoke screen ....noone in their right mind believes a word you say .....why not just resign ? Thatd be your 1st step to actually making america great again
Your act is getting old‚Ä¶ be the deal maker you claimed to be and find a compromise. Enough with the hostage negotiations‚Ä¶ the US doesn‚Äôt make deals with terrorist‚Ä¶
Your all immigrants
Your all like lambs to the slaughter blindly following this fool. Next you'll be saying you believe in Jesus,  hahaha!
Your an orange dumm ASS
Your best friend is the russian president:)))))
Your brain needs to be removed it‚Äôs  A fraud
Your child molester and a rapist
Your doing a great job Mr. President. Apparently most Democrats are eligible for a Darwin Award.
Your doing an amazing job.
Your doing great Mr President! Thank you for standing up for the USA and defending our borders and not backing down. Build the wall!!!
Your felon in chief will face serious charges, as have his cohort. Mueller is careful and thorough, and we shall see what he has when he is ready. There is proof. The investigators are not partisan. My 'side' is the one using the constitution, seeking truth, and considering everything. Your invective is not persuasive, and would be an embarrassment to you, if you were capable of being embarrassed.
Your highest and most important duty is to protect and defend the Constitution. That was the oath you took when you were sworn in. But you have never been good at keeping oaths, have you?
Your highest and most important duty? How about right after your first priority of fleecing anyone and everyone of every last dollar you can? They don‚Äôt call you Don the Con in Manhattan for nothing Mr. President.
Your loyalty is to Russia and Putin, not the Americans who can‚Äôt pay there bills because of your tantrum!!! Whether dem or republicans you have an obligation to treat us all fair and equally. You haven‚Äôt done that, because you‚Äôre a weak, ignorant fool, not leader
Your most important duty is to Putin and associates : https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1GE1C0
Your most important duty is to resign and leave the fuckin country bc YOU AINT JACK SHIEEET!!! üòÇüò≠
Your mother
Your not a black sheep when your a Republican, your just a smart citizen !
Your not black and I'm not white, we are Americans.
Your obstinate stance to obtain a border wall is perverse as you hold the lives of 800,000 federal workers and their families hostage in this dispute with Democrats.  Shame on you! So cruel!
Your own lawyer is now admitting your campaign was conspiring with the Russians and you send the armed forces to the border and threaten to have them shoot women and children. The greatest current enemy of democracy and free speech is in the white house and controlled from Moscow!
Your own personal gain and the advancement of your family is your main priority.
Your president Donald Trump can only do so much and I think he knows it, he's got a bible, he knows what he's up against not flesh and blood but something way bigger than him, New World Order is on its way. They have already paved preparation to reveal the Anti Christ to the world and President Donald Trump is there to slow him down abit. Satan has to have people working for him to push his agenda through? Congress and Democrats are doing that for him.
Your propaganda does not hide the fact that Secretary of Defense, James Mattis - a REAL patriot, resigned because your world view is dangerous to the Republic. Cadet Bone Spurs.
Your right not sure how they are stuck in his web of lies.
Your right on
Your the Man ,Mr.Trump I really appreciate your loyalty to our nation and the American people.God bless you Mr.President!Keep it up sir,the Democrats have been underestimating you right from the start !
Your the first Present to try and actually do something and we appreciate it
Your tie is too long.
Your tie needs to be longer #realdonaltrump to compensate for your flabby neck.. Just sayin'
Your ties are too long mr trump
Your time is up pal
Your wall is not protecting our country.   This is a made up crisis by a fake president who doesn't have a brain or a soul.
Your're a worthless bitch..

You‚Äôre a crook you‚Äôre a fraud and you‚Äôre a fucking joke Mr. President
You‚Äôre a fucking idiot!!!! You are the crisis!!!! Resign you pos! We the people want you in prison you fucking traitor!!!!! You and your family are deplorable, disgusting and a complete disgrace!!!!
You‚Äôre a fucking joke üôÑ
You‚Äôre a god damn incompetent coward whose highest priority is to grift your moron supporters, degrade the integrity of this nation, and dodge the blame when it‚Äôs on your shoulders. You and your stooges are a plague. Keep talking about your stupid wall when Isis has just killed four servicemen and an American citizen was killed by terrorists in Africa. But that‚Äôs too unpleasant for you to mention because you‚Äôre a coward and your supporters are idiots with zero critical thinking skills.
You‚Äôre a jackass
You‚Äôre doing a great job!!

You‚Äôre getting your ass whooped by a woman!!! Stop lying and get people back to work you fucking clown.

You‚Äôre never going to get a border wall.  If you were to get the $50-$100 billion it would cost to build the wall it would not be built inside trumps lifetime. Which means before the project even got started the next president would end it.
You‚Äôre ruining this nation, Trump, you stupid, fucking, ignorant twat! And the great thing is, you‚Äôre finally realizing it and you‚Äôre panicking! Bwa ha ha! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

Yup. Without a wall we will cease to be a Nation, a United States of America, of American Citizens.

and that is just what the evil demonRats want....the USA destroyed.

ceasing to be a nation is what the democrats want.
choose one....defense or attack
clown
cnn said that "Cohen was the President's lawyer". I have to look that up if that is strictly correct. Was Cohen the lawyer of the Potus when he took Office? The word "lawyer" also seems not really correct: Cohen was in fact more of a fixer. Nobody sees him as "a learned legal mind" at all.
common con artist
correct what are you waiting for?
could build the wall easily and have money left over if we made 2 new aircraft carriers instead of 3.  we would still have like 10x more aircraft carriers than other countries too

didn't the Berlin wall come down?
do not cave, we want the wall. trump strong!
do the wall -do the wall  do the wall,,,,,, with snipers too,,,
do whats in your heart Sir.
doesnt make any sense
don't flinch we 63 mil and counting have your back ,as you have ours
don't use govt workers as pawns in your fight for a wall.... bad strategy.
donald The HIGHEST and MOST IMPORTANT DUTY you have in keeping our country safe is STOP THE DOMESTIC TERRORISM/VIOLENCE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY.  NO WALL needed for that and NO WALL needed to fix IMMIGRATION LAWS where those who are only here on temporary visas ARE STILL HERE!  For those of you who probably are NOT familiar with what that means is that the 9/11 terrorists gained LEGAL entry here through the immigration system.  FOUR of the terrorists were here on business visas and FOURTEEN of the terrorists were here on 6 month tourist visas!  They had ALL expired.  As far as the wall goes if our children and citizens of domestic terrorism here are protected by thoughts and prayers that is good enough for the southern border!  Most of you have NEVER even been to the southern border.  I lived on the southern border many years being part of a military family and I guarantee you a wall is useless.

i can hear your google humming... üòÇüíØ
i have to go pee
i love USA & the President of our Country.   He did not to go through all of this crap you guys put him through bc he is wealthy yet he still does it, why ?   bc he loves our country !!!
i say keep troops in usa and protect usa canada should do same  but trudeau is not strong like you he is sissy which i didn,t elect he got in by pot vote and people tired of previous leader in too long
i think michael cohen is lying aboutr trump to save his neck he lying about the project not true at all he is lying just to safe his own neck that all he doing michael cohen you are  a liar big time liar lying to muller like that about trump.
i think you should go on strike
i thought it was an anime-like pic but actually it was himself, this man is awesome
i wish nigeria can learn from you
if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that‚Äôs where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don‚Äôt see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That‚Äôs unacceptable.  Anyway, I‚Äôm done discussing it.  If üá∑üá∫ doesn‚Äôt interfere,  üòâ I‚Äôm sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
if so,why are your people in foreign countries...Afganistan,Sirija....and  are conducting violence and crime,especially drugs which they bring to U.S.A
if the gov wont build the wall we will build the wall!
if walls don't work ..... then why does China have one that can be seen frome space!!!!!
if we allow the chump to continue with his ignorant actions (not to mention words) we will definitely cease to be a nation.  THE GODDAMNED CHUMP IS A GREATER THREAT TO THE USA THAN PUTIN AND KIM COMBINED!
if we are a nation that does not like our president ...we cease to be great
if we cease to be a nation then there is a world full of rogue soldiers
if we don't secure our country from RUSSIA.....ü§î‚úä
if we dont get you and your cohorts out of our WH we cease to be a nation.  please die and take mikie with you.
if you dont stand up solid against the dems they will weaken you to their way of thinking AND BESIDES YOU WOULD BE LETTING THE ONES PROTECTING THE BORDER THAT AND OTHERS DOWN take some of that money in the bill that they want to pass (50some billion) to send to other countries and use it for the border . why should we support countries that hate us?DO NOT SUPPORT A BILL THAT FUND ABORTIONS, AND WASTED MONEY TO COUNTRIES THAT HATE US
impeach pelosi and schumer for malfeasance and obstruction
interesting that Trumps thinks of visiting troops is always a PR stunt. Very insulting to the troops.
is going a good job of making us a nation
issue? like what?
it only took place while obama was president... " he did nothing "
ive been in facebook prison , no big deal. this site is a ghetto of no freedom .just  use it , abuse it , crap on it . what ever it gave you ,you just give it back !
just declare a national emergency and build the wall, the slats and get this over with. the longer this non payment of workers goes on the worse it gets and NP says no to everything so just do it. I read where Kuschner said not to do it. well who are you going to listen to.
just heard on cbc  we have 60 isis here don.t know  what to do with them  i say kill them  but they have to have proof to get them in court. the kurds have 1000 isis . 500 wives and 1000 children canadian .   what  do you do with them i say kill them in syria don.t bring them  home to canada but i don.t know mr trump what do you guys do with them.  we have woman in court now with butcher knife trying to kill people  mall by me  for isis . she is only going court now happened in summer. so you don.t need troops in syria isis here now
just like hillary
just what is the matter with these stupid democrats, esp. Pelosi and that guy??  they are a bunch of sick jerks.
keep it up President Trump.They are all losing their minds because you are truly saving our nation
keep up the great work making America great again!!
keep your stance. state of the union in Arizona, Jeff Flakes home town, Angel moms, large stadium tv with live pictures of the caravans, show live shots of the poop on the streets of Calif invite the leader of china , and then thank Nancy p. for her help. maybe even a large scale model of her homes and wineries in the background. if she wants to play games we'll play. In order to protect us from this invasion no scheme is too outlandish....üòÅ...
less russia plus united states
let me know when you see it...... 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 King James Version (KJV)  51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  King James Version (KJV)
let's put Hillary on the other sideüòâüòÅ
lets build the wall,  now i feel i need security, when i used to be young i never needed any security any walls
like leon
lipstick on a pig graphics intern needs to be furloughed
lol bone spurs all i got to say.....coward
lol if you think that‚Äôs a mic drop. I‚Äôll let you have it.   I‚Äôm more concerned with why we have a president who thinks a wall is of the utmost importance when his own press secretary has admitted that threat is entering by airport & why people are working & not being paid.
lol, ok. I'm sorry you are so easily conned.
lol. Really? tRump inherited $40 million from his dad, filed bankruptcy 6 times, then convinced a small minority of Americans that he was a great businessman by playing one on a tv reality show.
look at this nigga deadass hitting that Jotaro stance
love Trump
love you TRump -may the lord bless u against the democrats
lying fat ass crook
m e n a c i n g
makes sense. when you put up the wall put pelosi on the other side of it. thanks in advance.
man what fucking creep you are asshole oh I know what the people are going through why don't we go to daddy and get more money what a fucking tool asshole your DADDY is DEAD mother fucker
may the force be with you mister president.
maybe someone who knows you well gave you some lego
my name is Timothy Gadberry .... a 52 year old white male who was born and raised in Oklahoma city.  I am a American citizen.  I am asking if you too are American Citizens.   from what I understand, ...the Russian government have been working hard to divide the people who make up our democracy, .. claiming to be American Citizens throughout social media outlets.  the goal is to sway public opinion as well as causing division within our United population of men and women who have faith in our great democracy. are you guys American Citizens  ??
nice
no sense replying to someone named "Rod" .  Enough said
no she doesn't love trump the fat baby man
no wall criminal traitor individual #1
no, your ego is.. and a big phallic wall.
not at all, Linda...45 supporters are in the higher bracket of intelligence..they voted for a WINNER...don't have to tell you what bracket you fall into..!
null and void our thriving economy, bring back Isis, send our vets from Korean war back, and I guess kim jong un should fire missles again , null and void the new trade deal , I could go on but you get the point. you may dislike our GREAT PRESIDENT, but please do not make pathetic and ignorant remarks, but if you truly feel this way maybe you should leave this GREAT COUNTRY.
o Truer Words:  ‚ÄúHe has so singular a combination of defects for the office of a constitutional magistrate, that he could have obtained the opportunity to misrule the nation only by a visitation of Providence. Insincere as well as stubborn, cunning as well as unreasonable, vain as well as ill-tempered, greedy of popularity as well as arbitrary in disposition, veering in his mind as well as fixed in his will, he unites in his character the seemingly opposite qualities of demagogue and autocrat.‚Äù he continued, was ‚Äúegotistic to the point of mental disease‚Äù and had become ‚Äúthe prey of intriguers and sycophants."
oh, it's there..Joan..the love for our president..from all the people who want to live in freedom...that is a vast majority of the citizens..!
ok...are you the president or is pelosi?...be the president....build the wall...they now have the power to get you to open the gov. and they then will discuss border security...ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
omg, then what would you have done with CRIMNILLARY who was the one who was PAID by the russians ??
once the wall goes up you dickheads cant excape FFS , ,get a fucking brain
one term president if that
or if we allow Putin's puppet to keep calling the shots, we will cease to be a nation
other country's have tougher laws and enforce them ...in other country's if you steal you get your hand cut off, here you get a slap on the hand... other country's if you kill someone you get put In front of a firing squad,  here you get 20 years of appeals till your unfit for death...see the difference we need stricter laws and to enforce them..
overexagerrated..stfu grow up
people maybe Pelosi can give her pay to people for shut down its only 194,000
people need a broader news intake; too many Americans simply refuse to pay attention to what's actually happening, and that's the only thing you have to rely on for 2020.
photo shop can fix his ugly obese A%&
please Nancy ... Explain.. Try real Hard.. Can you tell us why all your windows are Barred? Why at your mansion entrance... there stands an armed Guard? If we try to get past Him.. We would  be feathered and Tarred.... Yes Nancy ..Please.. Tell us again.. How MS-13 thugs are really our Friends..  You say who gets a Wall.. Just Depends.. Just Depends.. You tell us a Wall.. is a thing that offends.. To the rest of the world .. the bad message it Sends.. But Nancy... Explain.. If that were really True.. Why in the world ..is there a wall built around You?
please go do your "duty" in the bathroom and not crap on the working people that are now w/o pay but still working diligently-most live paycheck to paycheck.
pray for trump, pray for the USA

thank you mr president

thanks for saving the country
that's right "borders" both South & Northern borders and ask for a real wall 50ft high and 10 billion or build nothing! Don't make a joke out of this important national crisis BUILD THE WALL or resign
that's what has happened in England, no longer a nation.
thats a fuckin jojo pose
thats what the bilderbergs and their type of globalist ilk wants. buy america and destroy the white males first. screw you bastards. america forever bitches. many guns waiting for your flake asses.
the LIAR in chief is at it again! he does NOT want a secure border. he is using this to stoke his base and shutting down the government shows how little he care about our citizens! there are hundreds of thousands of federal employees and millions of people in the HUD program that are suffering because of dumbass donnies stand. people are choosing prescriptions or food to survive and he does NOT care one little bit about their troubles. he has NO compassion or empathy for anyone.
the coast guard helps defend our borders, yet here they are not getting paid
the defense of the country is more important than the well-being of the citizens that makes no fucking since throw the whole damn government away
the defense of the nation is the number one priority of the whole federal government.
the money for your Donald Trump in 2020 president not for wall and war and gun and all the thing is for 2020 president Donald Trump right   nobody can do 2020 president this president is only Donald Trump right
the nation if without decent and look the heyna attack in africa
the real definition of an assault rifle is a full auto with a select fire but the liberals say anything that holds more than 10 rounds. My point is that he banned something and is not going to refund anyone for them which is thief.
the upside is we can all stop paying taxes if we don't have a country...and my question is why are you funding the destruction of your country?
then RESIGN go live with Putin in Moscow
then defend them with that military budget lmao
then fund the coast guard
this IS what is such a Contradiction - House, Congress and Senate Not until this PRESIDENT was ANYTHING done about Opioids,,,,  And still NOTHING on Illegal Drugs - - - -I SMELL A RAT

this photoshopped picture of trump is so funny - he hasn't been that thin for over 20 years - the real Pinocchio trump is fat, mostly bald and orange. Trumps is as ugly on the inside as he is on the outside - ugh!

‚ÄúAfter I take Russian sanctions away so they won‚Äôt release the pee tapes or tell America I‚Äôm broke and Russia owns me‚Äù.
‚ÄúDefense of our nation‚Äù includes our military throughout the world who have been been used as pawns due to an uncoordinated foreign policy while you obsess on our southern border.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up... If there‚Äôs a concrete wall in front of you, go through it, go over it, go around it, but get to the other side of that wall.‚Äù -Donald Trump Wagner College, 2004
‚ÄúIf you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.‚Äù
‚ÄòLawyer Bug Eyes‚Äô makes Real News: TRump Camp Colluded with Russia  Giuliani stuns with new claim: ‚ÄòI never said there was no collusion‚Äô 01/17/19 08:00 AM By Steve Benen  When Rudy Giuliani comments on the investigation into the Russia scandal, his observations tend to fall into two broad categories: he reflects on things that have happened in the past and things that might happen in the future.  When the former mayor focuses his attention on the latter, his comments are of little value. Giuliani often seems hopelessly lost about where Donald Trump‚Äôs legal defense is headed, the status of talks with Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs team, and what the president is likely to do next. By and large, when it comes to future developments, Giuliani routinely appears to be guessing.  But when he comments on things that have already happened, I think there‚Äôs a qualitative difference. More specifically, when Giuliani talks about the past, he‚Äôs reflecting on things he presumably knows more about: evidence he‚Äôs seen, witnesses he‚Äôs spoken to, details he‚Äôs reviewed, etc.  With this in mind, when Giuliani dramatically changes his story about central questions at the heart of the Russia scandal, it‚Äôs worth taking note. Consider this exchange from last night between the former mayor and CNN‚Äôs Chris Cuomo.  CUOMO: Mr. Mayor, false reporting is saying that nobody in the campaign had any contacts with Russia. False reporting is saying that there has been no suggestion of any kind of collusion between the campaign and any Russians. Because now you have Paul Manafort giving poll data that winds up leading to this coincidence ‚Äì  GIULIANI: I ‚Äì I never said ‚Äì well, you just misstated my position. I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign ‚Äì  CUOMO: Yes, you have.  GIULIANI: I have no idea if ‚Äì I have not. I said the president of the United States.  There a few angles to this that are worth keeping in mind. The first is that Giuliani, in reality, really is on record saying that the Trump campaign ‚Äì not just the president himself ‚Äì did not collude with Russia during its attack on the American elections. Giuliani is now changing his story. It seems likely that he learned something new that led him to adopt this new position.  Second, Trump‚Äôs lawyer defines ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù in a ridiculously narrow way. To hear Giuliani tell it, the president‚Äôs campaign may have cooperated with a hostile foreign power during its attack on U.S. elections, but so long as the president didn‚Äôt personally help the Kremlin hack DNC computers, there‚Äôs no reason to take the controversy seriously. That‚Äôs absurd.  And finally, it‚Äôs worth appreciating just how many times Trump World has moved the goalposts. In 2016, the original line from the Republican and his team was that Russia didn‚Äôt interfere in the elections at all. When that proved untenable, Trump and his team categorically denied that there were any communications whatsoever between the campaign and Vladimir Putin‚Äôs government.  At a pre-inaugural press conference, Trump said no one from the Trump campaign was in contact with Russia during the campaign. Just a few days before Inauguration Day, for example, CBS‚Äôs John Dickerson asked Mike Pence, ‚ÄúDid any adviser or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the election?‚Äù The vice president-elect responded at the time, ‚ÄúOf course not.‚Äù  There‚Äôs no doubt that those claims were flamboyantly untrue.  The Trump World‚Äôs argument has evolved several times since, and it‚Äôs arrived at a new location: the president‚Äôs political operation and Russia may have colluded after all. That‚Äôs not my argument; that‚Äôs the president‚Äôs lawyer‚Äôs argument.
‚ÄúNormally President Trump comes down and joins visitors for dinner after he‚Äôs spied on Ivanka having her early evening shower, and then retreats to his own bedroom to tuck into a mountain of grease and carbohydrates while watching his favourite Stormy Daniels porno."
‚ÄúNow you sons-a-b*tches know how I feel!‚Äù (General George Patton)
‚ÄúSen. Mitch McConnell is blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. Yes, the same person who won‚Äôt even let the Senate vote on a bill he knows would pass with a veto-proof majority and reopen the government is accusing Democrats of keeping the government closed.‚Äù - Allen Clifton
‚ÄúThe Founders worried about electing a president who lacked character or a sense of honor, but Americans have long since lost the moral vocabulary to articulate such concerns explicitly, preferring to look instead for demonstrable violations of rules that illuminate underlying character flaws. It is Trump‚Äôs unfitness for office that necessitates impeachment; his attacks on American democracy are plainly evident, and should be sufficient.‚Äù The Atlantic‚Äôs Yoni Appelbaum makes the case for impeachment.
ÿúWe must construe that wall on the southern border. Now the new president of Mexico is a declared socialist, admirer of Chavez, Venezuela, and Castros Cuba. When Mexico enters the classic Communist socialist crisis of the Cuba type, the ordas of Mexicans fleeing from Mexico through the border will be of biblical proportions. Remember the exodos of Cubans to USA, exodos of Venezuelans to the USA, from Nicaragua to the USA, ETC and these countries are NOT border with USA, analyze this.
