They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

Work on them and they'll do something about Nancy Pelosi.  Pelosi needs to be reminded of who it is she works for and that she is NOT the president....not even close.

Mark Butler aw are you trying to spam me with all the :) and >:( come on.,Bulld the wall using this Mr Trump Public Law No. 85-804, codified at 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 1431-35 (Supp. IV 1998), grants to the President the authority to authorize any agency which exercises functions in connection with the national defense to enter into contracts or into amendments or modifications of contracts, and to make advance payments, without regard to other applicable legal provisions whenever such action would facilitate the national defense. 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 1431. The legislative history of the statute indicates that it may also be used as the basis for making indemnity payments under certain government contracts.
Mark Butler have fun looking at my page and just don't forget 6 MORE YEARS Trump 2020!,Bulld the wall using this Mr Trump Public Law No. 85-804, codified at 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 1431-35 (Supp. IV 1998), grants to the President the authority to authorize any agency which exercises functions in connection with the national defense to enter into contracts or into amendments or modifications of contracts, and to make advance payments, without regard to other applicable legal provisions whenever such action would facilitate the national defense. 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 1431.

Norene Boone and just how many executive orders leap frogged passed Congress by Mr I've got a pen and a phone?,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Will Ihrke other presidents have called for a wall he's the only one with enough guts to do it.,I wouldn't call it a crisis, but a major concern that should have been dealt with decades ago. But it's funny how the Democrats flipped suddenly on their debate tactics for this issue. Any other issue and they dig deep and pull out all the unique tragedies and cry about how terrible it is for this one person, so we should change society just for them. However, Trump decides to play the emotion card and he's called a liar and every other name in the book. He's playing the game they invented. What poor sports.
Tonya Justice Sweetie how do you figure? I am almost 62 years old , I got a job 3 days after I turned 18! Never received anything from welfare you ignorant ass!

Wow, you would rather have a crumbling cement wall than provide healthcare to women and children. You are a true member of Cult 45.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Matty Wagner yes ! ‚ÄúWe the people‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really apply !

the real definition of an assault rifle is a full auto with a select fire but the liberals say anything that holds more than 10 rounds.

The problem is when the immigrant doesn't face any charges because they are here illegally.   My uncle was killed in aurora colorado. He was hit by an illegal alien who was driving drunk without a license. The courts commuted his ENTIRE sentence so that he could be deported. So he is probably in mexico drinking beers with his friends while my aunt and cousins have no father or husband.,Drunk drivers come from all walks of life. I'm sorry for the family.

This sums up the shutdown from the framework of our government. It lays out the facts. I am sharing this from another person who posted and please do share as well. I am not normally political. This post will be an exception because I am an American and I am concerned. Please allow me to frame the issues involved with "the wall" in its actual terms. Despite what the media is saying, this is not about Democrat vs. Republican. In short, the executive branch of our government is threatening to declare a national emergency since the legislative branch will not authorize the seizure of private American property for a federal works project nor will fund it. The executive branch has already shut down the federal government. It is currently threatening to extend this government shut down for however long it takes for the legislative branch to cave. Let us break this down. First of all, the framework of our government is based on checks and balances. Power is divided into three branches: the Executive, the Legislative, and the Judicial. The Legislative branch controls the purse strings of government and creates laws. The Executive branch carries out those laws. The Judicial branch tells us whether the laws are constitutional or not. Each branch was designed to be able to balance the other branches. Why? As shown by our original rebellion, Americans didn't want a King or a Dictator when we were setting up our government. We were not particularly thrilled with a House of Lords telling us what we could or could not do either. In this case, the executive branch wants to: (1) take governmental cash,  (2) create its own law,  (3) take away private property from American citizens  (4) create its own federal works project. At least three of these functions fall within the power/ responsibility of the legislative branch. So, what is the problem? This is one of the most naked power grabs by the executive branch over the others in recent history. Once that power is exercised, it is going to be difficult or impossible to regain any balance again. The executive branch was never meant to have that much power (see our country's previous concerns about Kings and Dictators). Is this constitutional? Very doubtful. Should all Americans be concerned? That is a question for you to answer yourself. Second, a "National Emergency" is generally declared under these general conditions:  (1) Natural disasters including hurricanes, tornados, and earthquakes to name a few.  (2) Public health emergencies such as significant outbreaks of infectious diseases.  (3) Military attacks.  (4) Civil insurrection. (5) Any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy. Now the first 4 aren't applicable. The last category was meant to be short-term only. It was designed to be reviewed by the legislative branch every year after it‚Äôs enacted (because again; the check and balance is fundamental to how we operate). So, what is the problem here? If national emergencies can be declared by the executive branch for non-emergency purposes which vest power in one branch of the government why would that branch ever let go of that power again? Third, the seizure of private property (known as ‚Äúeminent domain‚Äù, a body of law which says the government cannot just take your home without due process). You are joking, right? No. The US/Mexican border is 1,933 miles long. It runs through 4 states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas). Only 33% of that land is actually owned or managed by the Federal Government. A sizable percentage of that land is owned by the Indian nations. It is land preserved for those tribes by treaty and land given under treaty is not land owned by the United States. These tribes already have a lot of reasons to be angry at the Federal Government. This would be pouring additional gas on an open flame. The other 64% of that land is privately owned. How much land would have to be taken? The amount of land that the Federal Government would have to take would likely run 1,237 miles long to 12,371 miles deep (assuming a 1 to 10-mile DMZ from the border into the United States). Even if we could only take 100 to 500 ft of land in densely populated areas, that is a lot of private property that is going to be seized by the Federal government. The land necessary for this project would also run through some highly populated areas in the US such as San Diego, Calexico, Nogales, El Paso, and Laredo. There will be a lot of Americans who are going to have their homes and businesses taken by the federal government. Which will also mean a lot of lawsuits. In terms of the federal works project, these types of works include hospitals, bridges, highways, walls and dams. These projects may be funded by local, state, or federal appropriations. If they are federal, they are funded by the legislative branch of our government (the same branch that our executive branch is currently trying to take power from). Is the seizure of power constitutional? Not likely given the separation of powers discussed above. Finally, these considerations do not take into account the sheer cost, human and monetary, that will be involved. The Department of Homeland Security estimates the current cost at $21 billion for construction alone (not counting costs of maintenance or costs associated with increased military/federal patrolling). Ask yourself a simple question. When was the last time that you saw a governmental project brought in under time and under budget? Does anyone remember the ‚Äúbig dig‚Äù in Boston, Mass? The actual costs are likely to be much higher. This estimated cost also does not include compensating folks for taking their land or the associated impact upon their businesses. The Federal budget deficit grew to $779 billion dollars in 2018 according to the Treasury Department. How are we, as a country, going to fund this project? How are we, as a country, going to deal with the additional debt? Unlike private businesses, our country cannot declare bankruptcy. This is not about Democrat vs. Republican. It is not about who has the best zingers measured in 10 second sound bites. It is about our country. The core of this issue deals with the profound and immense changes the outcome will have on the structure of our national. This is the way that we, as a country, should be framing these issues. Please think about it." Please share!,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.

Lynn Limauro Floyd sorry for your loss, but there are white kids shooting up your schools and killing a lot of innocent children the whites have been killing and raping since you set foot on American soil.

He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us.

Bob Segal considering most undocumented folks come through ALL ports of entry, perhaps we should build levees and a giant rooftop over the continental US..  It is not my job to be proactive. That would be the commander-in-cheif's job. My responsibility is to vote accordance to his performance...üò¨üòí   Idk where you got the "no wall" info. It is well known what the Dems have to offer and the wall is apart of the deal. It is the pricetag that goes with it.   And how convenient to place a broken promise 2 years after the fact. You know it was a race baiting sales pitch pipe dream to appeal to the disenfranchised and you know it. And dont try and weasel in anti-obama rhetoric to prove a point. We all know it was a Democratic agenda that was haphazardly dependant on young consumers who are, for the most part, young and healthy.,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Bob Segal idk but I was hoping 1 out of 300m voters could come up with a solution. My solution is the most logical but least popular which is to legalize narcotics, squander cartels, cease citizens uprooting themselves and risking life here, and use that wall $ for rehabs and drug prevention centers.  Let's face it. This whole problem stems from our country snorting and shooting up the issue that ultimately turned our current issue into fruition.  All of this is our fault. I am one of the few who humbly admits it.  And to counter argue your point, getting over, under, and through the wall has also become more advance as well. The wall is an expensive short term simplistic solution.,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Bob Segal or 100% repairing Flint MI some drinking water. Or solve world hunger for a year.  But hey, it is his legacy he wants to taint...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,$5B wall < $25 ladder
1) just because my offered solution doesnt meet your criteria doesnt inheritly mean I want nothing done. Stop thinking in extremes. You either agree or dont.

As it is not sea to shiny sea people will go around it, drug barons will use microlights to fly over it. $500 per inch is still ridiculous. Better to use the money at the crossing points for detection and personnel. Is he planning on replacing the existing barriers which are lower than 30ft and have no detection equipment? Where can we see the exact specification for the wall?,5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
Bog Segal Certainly but  if you are paying $500  per inch of wall I am sure it is poor value, especially as walls already exist in the most strategic places. I am not arguing against additional barriers. Trump has claimed down from 2000 miles of wall which was clearly ridiculous as natural barriers exist over much of the border. Why ignore the border with Canada?  How much will it cost to compensate the farmers and other businesses along the wall which will have access to the river removed? If Trump plans to build the wall in the middle of the river that would explain the cost, but a raft upstream could quickly come down either side.  Trump currently said $5.7 billion without releasing the costings or locations. That is a considerable sum to spend on a pig in a poke.,5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
Of course it would. Electronics to track the microlight and agents to intercept where it lands. Why would that not solve the problem,?,5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!

Dumb ass Democrats. Baby killers. Enough said.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Curtis Rice gee Curtis.  Maybe that's because there are more of us...,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Lol comunism? Dang you'll eat everything he feeds you,The borders are secured, you're just desperate for 2020
How about you learn some English. üòè,The Democrats are  just like spoiled children they would rather see this country get over run with criminals drug dealers and terrorist then to help the American people .most are so jealous of trump beating Hillary they will do anything and everything to sabotage his presidency including ruining this country just so they can get what they want it' not about helping it's about control
Lmao wow okay...,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Draft dodging is not serving...,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Donald trump is a President with  good heart and his is working to put things in place,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Everybody cares about his or her own self, but as a president his primary aim suppose to be putting the  needs of the masses first before considering his own need because without the masses who voted for him he will not be in that seat.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Sue Howie no it was about 4 foot tall and my dog gave up. Not all dogs would give up but he did and if the wall stops one criminal, one death then BUILD IT. Its not about Hate.,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.

I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
How do they know immagration has slowed down? Seems to me alot more has gotten away with entering illegally. Because I knew a girl who dated an illegal and he beat her ass in front of her kids, got arrested...got deported...got released and was back in 3 months. Big cities dont see the problem. Live in a small town and you will see it.,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.

Tyler Dougherty so the same sense would be made for a wall??,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
Hal Bannasch those walls are to keep people in and not out...also, there are guards with guns to shoot the ones trying to escape,Prison walls will keep us safe from you.
Jim Russell cuz it is not an emergency,WHY is declaring a National Emergency to address a National Emergency in The United States considered wrong? There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, "homes of the rich and famous‚Äù and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers"  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year." (* 2017, FAIR's)  This does not include cost of loss of life, property, and Democratic stability.
Scott Magers how have u been personally affectes by an illegal? just curious,Janice Beecher I don‚Äôt care what they voted against. They contribute to the insecurity of our borders every time they vote against the wall or any other security measures. Politicians should be held accountable for their stupidity and selfishness
Valerie Siggson idiot,The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that
Erin Curry Bayhan he will get paid, but when I put gas in car, buy groceries, pay my mortgage, electric etc they aren‚Äôt going to take an IOU. Fortunately we have savings for now, but there are many couples that work at the prison and single parents who need their paycheck. I‚Äôm over both sides and the blame game, I just want this to all end. It is a sad day in our country for sure.,Please open the government. My husband has been protecting the public from dangerous inmates and   is working for free. We have two children that we need to feed and provide shelter to! Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.
Timothy Coleman I feel sorry for you go to you youtube and look up yellow vest and then go online and look up Rememberence Project.  Socialist Media won't report it and they lie to you.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Annie Jacobs Stevens Who is going to pay for the wall?,Emil D√∂rr your actually in that park. I‚Äôm self sufficient and more likely providing all your benefits.

It's why we voted for him to be our President,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don‚Äôt want this wall.
I am so worried about the people that have done nothing wrong and all those workers not getting paid those are the Americans that  are legal and loosing houses and cars being punished for nothing they have control over :( deplorables that voted for President Trump .and the disabled loosing their food :( i understand wanting the wall but punishing Americans for it i dont :( worried how this will end . I was one of those deplorables,800,000 workers struggling to pay their bills, food stamps being eliminated for the needy, security of air travel being jeopardized, and our Coast Guard not being paid for life saving and stopping drug smuggling - That‚Äôs the Emergency!!!
If we started a go fund me page and everyone who wants the wall donated at least $20 the wall would be no problem,Mr President I agree with you however there are people working without pay meanwhile Congress an Senator's are still being paid so who are you out to punish the American people who voted for you I hope that isn't your intention we love the work you are doing just please don't punish us.

Tanya Pittman AMEN SISTA,What's more important to Democrats you ask? Getting you out of office and a real president in. One that is not a liar, crook, and Russian/North Korea lover; one who doesn't think they are a dictator and one who upholds the constitution (and has read it) and don't think he's above the law. That's what important to Democrats...restoring the office of the president of the United States!
Mich√®le Biwer-Erpelding how about we start taking care of our homeless and veterans who are also living on our streets.

Just don‚Äôt want to go back to your homeland?  And you want to Not give this opportunity to ones just like you?!,trump I want border security.  trump I do NOT WANT A WALL.  Tell your brain to listen to the American people WE DO NOT WANT AN INEFFECTIVE COSTLY WALL
Sue Schuster Aalykke I prefer he not keep ANY promise regarding that wall. Border security does not equal a wall.,Ann Parish Harper I agree.  Mexico would rightly never pay for a border wall.  I was being sarcastic.You can see what I wrote on his facebook page tonight.

Angela Wilson go check the facts Angela. Reaching out to help those refugees does not make country that does that a socialist country. That is the Christian thing to do.

Barby Bird only children and immature people hate Barby. You appear to be confusing opposition with hate. I do agree with you there does seem to be a sense of immaturity in the White House, but that of course has nothing to do with the Democrats. They are opposing trump‚Äôs willingness to squander Americans hard earned taxes. trump has promised the Mexicans would fund his wall, so why does he need the Democrats to approve? Makes no sense at all.,The replies from Pelosi and Schumer were filled with hate, outright lies and malice.  Their extreme hatred for President Trump is overriding their responsibility to the American people.  We need to protect ourselves and we can only do that with a border.  Nancy and Chuck can take their lies back to their lairs.  Anyone with half a brain can see through the dems.
Brent Robinson  They don‚Äôt care how many people die? Where are you getting your information from Brent?  They?  Who are they? They can‚Äôt allow to keep fulfilling his campaign promises?  What are you talking about?  trump has had two years time and the support of both houses and he couldn‚Äôt get his promised wall built. Neither has he collected the funds he promised he would from Mexico.  The state of trump‚Äôs approval is all down to himself and no one else.  Those who oppose trump are not traitors Brent, they simply think he is not fit for office.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Clint Backhaus nothing else to do Clint? If that is the case, why don‚Äôt you contact the man who is, not only happy but proud, to have government workers go without their pay cheque.

Schumer could never do a deal like you and he knows it. Looked like a trouble teenager in the principals office the other day with you. Democrats cant get rich on their own like you did. They need to steal and lie to get anywhere. Schumer's a rat that needs to go to the nursing home or find a trap. His number is 202-224-7433 but he's too much of a coward to answer.

Diane Mathieu you might think this is about defeating trump, but that is not the case. trump could have had his wall built already. He had both houses and two years time to do it. What stopped him? It‚Äôs clear he never had the backing, not from congress and not from the Republican party, but now he wants the Democrats to back the plan his own party wouldn‚Äôt. That is ridiculous!,Just build the wall. Those opposed will never change their minds. Its all about defeating Trump. Dont give them that! Most are behind you!
Jerry Risner with both houses of congress since trump took office two years ago, he couldn‚Äôt get the wall funded. Could that be because he lied about Mexico paying for it? How many times was he filmed saying that? Who knows, but he had his chance and blew it,Arev Neerg i'm sure your stern message will change his ways. the dems. plan of let them all in isn't a border security plan
Joseph Saab If trump had kept his promise he wouldn‚Äôt need the American taxpayers money, he would have collected the funds from Mexico, he hasn‚Äôt. He needs to keep that promise Joseph,Ann de Roo-Daly he already did with nafta....

They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

Democrats need to wake up!  I don't think their images of going to Hawaii, or Puerto Rico and having a grand time while government personnel aren't working/getting paid look too good.  Also saying that you don't like Trump's last offer before it was offered and gave you 4 out of 5 things you wanted looks good either.

When our country is attacked by China or Russia because his puerile tactics make our once strong country look like a laughing stock to all the world, I want you to tell me again the he is a great president.   He is making our country the fool of the world by running it like the moronic clown he is.   You're as delusional as he is.  If you're not terrified then you're as much of a fool as he is.,Fake President.
I take it you don't understand a marginal tax rate. That's okay a lot of people don't.,your promise was that taxpayers would not pay for the wall. We're among you to hold to your promise. Also, find a way to pay for it. Maybe a 70% tax on income over $10 million?
Paul Chiplock North Carolina seems to want the wall.,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don‚Äôt want this wall.
Maximus Herrera i wouldn't try  it the rednecks don't take things lightly and you wouldn't like the ending if you tried ask one.,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it‚Äôs an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
Carl Ostendarp at least he didn't have a big party and our boys in bengezi wasn't important enough for him or hillary to try and get them help! i call  BS BS BS at least the man does answer when called no matter where he is.,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.

no what is petty it you not understanding that this child wass taken by someone who shouldn't have been here in the first place.  so don't say it is an illegal thing when that is who killed there child.  see if you can get the congress or senate to pass a stiff law for anyone drinking and driving it won't happen cause they are the ones who are doing it all the time and walk away.  don't blame this parent =,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
hummm maybe you might need to learn to be a better driver with all those wrecks.  just saying seems like it is always someone elses fault 2 sides to a story,Annette Keller I used to drive for a living, and spent a lot of hours on the road. I'm sure the people who crashed into me had their side of the story, but the police who investigated agreed with my side. If you can tell me how it was my fault a woman ran into the back of me while I was at a red light, I'd be glad to listen. What do I know, maybe turned off her lights and sped off away from the scene because she had to use the bathroom really bad. Innocent people do that all the time.

Sandy Green Amen sister!,Protect the border. Protect Americans. BUILD THE WALL
it's amazing how he was deported but managed to get back to the US, managed to get a car and drive around!!!! omg how could the authority let him do that so freely??? the state should be sued for this!,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL

Danny Jones I‚Äôve always wondered why GB joined the EU, they were stable without them. Good luck to you,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Danny Jones what culture might that be that Trump is destroying? The European Union destroyed itself, and the reason why Britain wants out. Don‚Äôt blame our president for your country‚Äôs mistakes. Our president is busy with fixing our country‚Äôs issues.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Juli Hudgins Trantham you r one crazy bitch!!!!,PLEASE READ....VERY IMPORTANT!!!!I just saw a report from Corey Woods where illegal immigrants are filing tax claims on children who do not live here in the US. They are claiming multiple nieces and nephews that are out of the United States and have never lived here. We have to have social security numbers to claim our children. Why aren't they receiving a number for their children that they have in the United States for them to claim? Why do they not have to prove that a child lives here? The amount of money they are receiving on the child tax credit is insane and should be stopped and some kind of proof needs to be provided to show that that child lives here. üòñ

Read this John Mutyaba :  ‚ÄúFalse Says Sen. Chuck Schumer in 2014 "helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall" and now opposes Trump's $5 billion request for a border wall "just because he's a Republican." ‚Äã ‚Äî Bloggers on Monday, December 17th, 2018 in a blog post Meme mischaracterizes Chuck Schumer's record on border security funding  By John Kruzel on Thursday, December 20th, 2018 at 11:10 a.m.  A meme gaining traction on social media claims Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., supported a border wall deal during Barack Obama‚Äôs presidency but then flip-flopped once President Donald Trump took the White House.  The post contains a photo of Schumer and a mock first-person confession revealing the Senate minority leader‚Äôs partisan reason for the apparent policy pivot.  "In 2014, I helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall," reads the post from a group called The Right View Of Washington State. "Now, Trump wants $5 billion for a border wall. Well I‚Äôm gonna b----, cry, piss and moan just because he‚Äôs a Republican and wants it."  The post was flagged as part of Facebook‚Äôs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The meme is swimming in factual errors and fishy interpretations.  No border wall deal in 2014 The post says Schumer helped put together a border wall deal in 2014. That‚Äôs wrong ‚Äî there was no border barrier deal that year.  It‚Äôs possible the creator of the post was thinking of a 2013 proposal that Schumer shepherded through the Senate. But characterizing the 2013 legislation as a $25 billion deal to fund a "border wall" runs into factual hurdles.  That proposal, a comprehensive immigration plan Schumer sponsored and voted for, cleared the Senate in 2013. But the Republican-controlled House did not take up that bill after that. (It‚Äôs worth noting that presidents, not lawmakers, as the meme suggests, sign bills into law.)  The package included more than $46 billion for border security. The vast majority of that money ($30 billion) was for hiring more U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. Around $8 billion would have gone toward building or repairing 700 miles of fencing (including some double-layer fencing) along the U.S.-Mexico border.  That‚Äôs not $25 billion for a wall, as the meme claimed.  Fence vs. wall It would be a stretch to say the fencing Schumer supported in 2013 fits the same description as Trump‚Äôs "impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall," with "precasts going up probably 35 to 40 feet in the air."  Schumer‚Äôs office insisted a border fence is very different from Trump‚Äôs promised wall. The senator‚Äôs office pointed us to a Trump tweet from the election when then-candidate Trump scolded his opponent Jeb Bush for conflating the two.  "Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a ‚Äòfence.‚Äô " Trump tweeted. "It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!"  Daniel Yoken, a Schumer spokesman, said, "Sen. Schumer supported fencing where it makes sense then and still does today."  Schumer has also argued that border security isn‚Äôt limited to a wall, and that there are other, more effective ways to secure the border. The meme claims Schumer opposes a wall "just because" Trump is a Republican.  One more point to clarify: Schumer in January 2018 said he offered to back funding for Trump‚Äôs border wall in exchange for a broader immigration package that included a deal for so-called Dreamers, young immigrants living in the country illegally.  Schumer reportedly made a $25 billion offer for the wall during a private meeting with Trump, as lawmakers negotiated a way to avert a government shutdown. Schumer rescinded his offer just a few days after making it, saying it was off the table because Trump rejected the broader immigration package.  The New York Times reported that while the White House refused to acknowledge that Schumer made the wall offer, Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle confirmed it.  An offer on behalf of Schumer‚Äôs part to fund a border wall undermines the meme‚Äôs notion that he‚Äôs automatically ruled out the wall simply because Trump wants it.  Our ruling The Facebook post says Schumer in 2014 "helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall" and now opposes Trump's $5 billion request for a border wall "just because he's a Republican."  There are numerous factual errors here: there was no border barrier deal in 2014. A 2013 legislative package proposed $8 billion for border fencing ‚Äî not $25 billion for a border wall.  More importantly, the border fencing Schumer backed in 2013 is different than how Trump has described his border wall. And the meme glosses over Schumer‚Äôs previous support for border wall funding earlier this year, in exchange for protections for Dreamers.  We rate this post False.‚Äù,Patton---Yeah and that electrical grid can be tampered with by terrorist's sneaking in through unsecured border miles!!! Use your brain!

Im satisfied with the results.
Let's see how long you'll be willing to go furloughed for. You'll break.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

You have proven my point with your responses.  That's the best you can do?,This isn't Trump's shut down, it's Putin's shut down.  Trump is doing Putin's bidding by crippling our society by its foundation.  Can't you see that Trump is tearing us apart by the seams, he divides us, propelling our young to animalistic hate.

Dianna Adams Ewen - If you are referring to the "new trade agreement with Mexico" that has never been ratified by Congress and therefore has never taken effect, no it does not make any provision for Mexico funding any phony walls, directly or indirectly.  And no I never thought Mexico was going to write a check.  I am not as stupid as your "president"  who said precisely that, or his voters who were stupid enough to believe him when he said it and believe him again when he claimed he never said it.,Hey pussy-grab, remember that time you told us Mexico was going to pay for the wall?

Funny you should mention El Paso...isn;t that the city with some kind of wall that was put up on the grounds it would way lower crime rates...but the city was already among the safest in the country and its wall didn't lower crimes rates...?,My heart weeps for them, and agree. Hopefully the people that El Paso is building units for, until they get processed won't be that. It's being told it's for Women and Children and the fact is that its more male than female or children. But you are all we got and you have the answers but sure don't agree with it but will back you...
Ward Karsman Well, let's just do a fact check on ONE of your list...Robert Byrd was honored by the NAACP after his death, because of his tireless work for civil rights.  I understand English can be tough when its not your native language, so let me explain that NAACP is an acronym -it's made up of the first letters of the words in the title of an organization- meaning "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People".,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Not a bad thought.  It should be part of a discussion of best ways to address any problem.,My son was killed by a drunk driver also. That man was from Long Island New York. Should we put a wall there too? Odds are in the years both of us lost our kids to drunk drivers the majority of them were born & raised in the USA. Does one death matter less because of the who or where they were from?  Yes laws need to be enforced all the way around but especially on the employers that hire undocumented workers.Something so many neglect to mention or enforce. Seems even Trump branded businesses like to hire the undocumented.  Not sure a wall in the middle of the desert would make much of a difference. Ports of entry, towns, cities is different.  Everyone agrees something needs to be done just some of us see the wall as a waste of money from a man that promised Mexico would pay for it. Maybe use fines imposed on businesses that use undocumented labor illegally to pay for a wall where it would be most effective.

Renee Korabiak Ah huh...let's not foget the multiple deliberate attempts on people Fauxtus considers enemies...ie deliberate actions taken to target and plan and physically obtain lethal items them deployed in attempts to kill them with malice aforethought, not some random guy trying to grab someone else's gun.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Try taking a good look at the northern border.  No wall.  Other methods. Terrific security.  And they aren't working on stopping poor terrified people trying to get away from conflicts we are partly responsible for...they are trying to make sure nobody gets to us through them and pulls another 9/11.  This wall is a waste of money.,The wall along with better technology, more personal, etc will all work together as our CBP has recommended.  We need to include more drug sniffing dogs.  They do a great job.

Anna Sophia Wheland I am sure you have decided to believe that not banning guns -and not having sensible, enforced gun laws either- would save more lives, but facts have already proven your belief to be wrong.,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Michael Thompson Let's compare.  I'll let you look up the number of people actually dead from far right shootings/stabbings in teh US vs from undocumented shootings/stabbings in the US just during trump's term to date.  I know you wouldn;t believe the facts if I looked them up for you; but I can give you a hint: the far right victims are higher...,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Michael Thompson You've never been to a US where every single gun was banned and the ban was enforced.,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
The majority living in the area are against it.,Anyone with any common sense or lives close to a border knows we need to build a wall and protect our country

Wondering why exactly?  I mean, since there was no national emergency then, either...but maybe you just meant to point out that if there had ever been one obviously the GOP would have had the trophy wall erected LONG ago, so it's blatantly clear there is no national emergency.,Art Jackson  Dear... The problem of immigrants before the elections before 2016... The problem is outdated... But at the beginning of 2017... Congress was Republican... The wall and its problems will not affect the 2020 elections... Like now... On the contrary it will be positive... and other things...
No, it is not possible.  You can see for yourself by looking back, trump's wall idea was never something the majority wanted.,The Mexican drug cartels have a lot of money and they know how to invest it to maximize their illegal profits. During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.  Is it possible that cartel money is now being used to change public opinion and the politicians opinions on the construction of the border wall between Mexico and the United States? I am just wondering now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

You mean like the parents of the kids at Sandy Hook, Parkland, etc?,That is so very sad also.  But that isn't what this message stream is about.  You should start a new post on that one.    Surely you would get support for it.

On the contrary, it is a broken tool that would not have done much anyway even when whole; you don;t use broken already inadequate but REALLY expensive tools to address a problem when you have tools that are whole, work well, and cost much less.,It's one tool Lori Olson Rasmann, you need to use all ways to stop the problem. Just because it doesn't solve the whole problem does not mean you shouldn't address the issue.

Except, of course, that there is none.,Sorry for your loss.  There are many of us who stand behind Trump and the wall.  We must stop the illegal immigrant invasion.

You meant to write something about the kickbacks from all those for-profit detention companies and all those contractors, I'm sure, since we all know Fauxtus has shattered both foreign and domestic emoluments clauses numerous times.,The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that

Mind=blown,So by Donald Dumbs logic the united states never was a nation because it never had a huge wall next to Mexico. Seems legit.
The wall is pointless. They will still get through and trump is making it seem like immigrants are the main problem committing crimes etc when it's our own American people!,The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!
Art Jackson hmmm, I lived down there and let me tell ya Art, not too long ago in El Paso, the drug dealers put razor blades on park swings and so forth. YOU call that safe? I do not. Try driving down there on the free way or the streets on the east side, some don't know how to drive with lines. My daughter had a friend down there whose father was found in the Rio Grande and the drones had to go find him. Hmmm safe, yeah right.,My heart weeps for them, and agree. Hopefully the people that El Paso is building units for, until they get processed won't be that. It's being told it's for Women and Children and the fact is that its more male than female or children. But you are all we got and you have the answers but sure don't agree with it but will back you...
Kathy Zimmerman Blackwelder lets pray too for the families who have lost loved ones by americans killers. President Trump needs to build the wall. After that, lets see what is he going to do with all the murders of this side of the wall.,Prayers for everyone who have lost loved ones because of illegal aliens. This is absolutely insane. Thankfully, I don't know anyone who has been harmed by an illegal but I am still for the wall. Walls are good. Walls help with many things. The people against to wall are - well, I won't put it in print - but one day it's going to affect them and we'll see how their opinion is then. So many people hate this president more than they love their country. God bless the friends and family affected and God bless our president and those trying to help.

Norene Boone aren't those bills without the wall? I don't know about everyone, but I think we need the wall.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall.

Tim Christ you are a politician moron,Barbara Blitfield Pech sorry but I am not a politician, and I am not a moron, BTW what is a politician moron?   So exactly what was wrong with the post I made, I know that I did not believe very much of what Bill Clinton, or Barack Obama promised, they lived up to my expectations!  So far most of what Trump can deliver on his promises, he has delivered, he has not yet delivered on promises that are dependent on congress and treasonous democrats, Trump has integrity, or he never would have succeeded as a business man.   We have a long history of liberal democrats lying to the people, and not giving a damn if they keep their promises.   Up until now the problem with republicans is they do not have the balls to fight the traitors known as democrats, that is until Trump!   Oh if possible name 10 democrat politicians with integrity, who are actively working for the American people, and not just shouting Heil Hussein when their leaders tell them to!

Yes Lawrence and Karen, they can still use boats or tunnels. However a fence is the biggest barrier to discourage and reduce people from entering illegally.,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Happy birthday, Patriot Logan!,Today is my birthday. I'd like a wall to be built please. Thanks!
Wow......  Bet you like those child tax credits...  Ken....,Remember Obamacare repeal? Republican House and Senate, Republican president, and Donald whiffed, twice. As I said, the Democrats are not the reason he constantly fails.

Abby Schmidt who cares who pays for it I don‚Äôt all I know to many Americans have lost so much due to the illegal immigrants that have know right to be here invading our country and our security the has to build the wall,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Awe Cheryl I feel for ya . But being willfully ignorant is so bad for the rest of us so stop it.,I feel so sad that you Mr. President have to take so much from the CORRUPT and EVIL Dems, but I THANK YOU for Putting Our Country FIRST !!!!
Jan McClendon Carter u got that right. They continue to get their pay & it‚Äôs not right.  Others are having to do without. We the people are the ones that put them in office & we just have to sit aside & let those scum bags do what they want, but something is going to have to give & some things need to be changed in Congress.,Donald J. Trump does congress still get paid during a shut down? You are so right in saying most of them have fences or protection around their mansions so what is the difference? Also they brought up spending on equipment adding man power who do they think will pay for this? It‚Äôs not about a wall for them it‚Äôs about getting their way!
I'm so sorry. I pray you will somehow be able to survive all the heartbreaking dynamics of  this absolutely horrible loss of your precious son. The Democrats have gone mad, and this is causing us so much grief and worry. My heartbreaks for you and your family, and I pray for you all and our country.,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Apple Rivera if this story is even true, which I doubt, because Enterprise would have told you that whoever they rented that truck to is responsible for any loss or damage incurred by that truck.  You did get the licence plate from the truck, didn't you?    And guess what ijit, if you rent a truck from Enterprise, a car from Hertz, etc, and you let anyone drive it that is not on the contract YOU signed, your butt is responsible.,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, ‚ÄúDaniel Zuniga‚Äù who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didn‚Äôt take responsibility because they said they didn‚Äôt contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found.

Edward Miller all presidents lie. Why didn't you say anything about the last one,Last I checked, Mexican border has remained the same since the 1850s, and we've seemed to get by. Illegal border crossings have steadily declined since the 1970s.  I'm trying to understand why now we have an "emergency", or "crisis"..  I thought healthcare was a crisis, that was going to be "so easy" to fix, and was going to be fixed on your first day, what happened??  Seems the great negotiator,  you're NOT!!!   You have said many, many times over the years, that a government shutdown is the president's fault, it shows their lack of ability to negotiate.   WELL?????

Well this article asked actual people who live on the border, deal with this made up crisis and they say No. I'll take their word over the word of someone making a living off of border security. Pretty sure the people getting paid have an alternative motive to their opinions.,Trump will have to confront one of the biggest challenges in building support for his wall: The people who live on the border say there is no national emergency and they don‚Äôt want a wall.  https://truthout.org/articles/mayor-of-texas-border-town-trumps-wall-is-pointless/Mayor of Texas Border Town: There is No Crisis Here, Trump's Wall is Pointlesstruthout.org

Hello here,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
You a bot?,What about the far larger amount of legals killing legals? I can go to a bar on any given night and witness a bunch of people driving off over the legal limit. Beyond drunk driving, legal citizens of the U.S. are far more likely to commit crimes statistically. What are we doing for the far lager amount of people hurt by legals?
you gotta love people who delete there comments...lol,Mr. Trump, No Americans dont want border security, they want you gone as president. Your a entertainer. Not a politician. You are making the presidency a entertainment place  Which many Americans are hurting because of your ways

I believe Nancy‚Äôs heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!

I believe Nancy‚Äôs heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!

John Wheeler But trying to reopen the Government is,  but looks to be an impossible task with half of the lawmakers refusing to talk and as usual showing that the American people are not their main concern,  they say how bad they feel for all those people who , and with the next breath they show them that they still care more about those new voters that they need to get into the Country. In the end those eight hundred thousand furloughed workers their  families and friends will decide who to hold responsible for this shutdown. I doubt they are all sitting around the kitchen table cheering the fact the the Democrats refuse to even discuss any kind of compromise,  they can plainly see that the President is trying, can‚Äôt imagine that they are sending messages to Pelosi letting her know that it‚Äôs ok hold your ground, it‚Äôs ok the kids ate yesterday, they will make it for a couple of more days, the electric company probably won‚Äôt turn off the power during the coldest weather we have had so far,  our neighborhood brought a couple of gallons of gas for the car just Incase we have an emergency.

Hilary Seymour,  I am so sorry for what you went through..  God Bless You and Give You Peace!!,I was working for an employer who had hired illegal immigrants and didn't notify the staff that had been working there. One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place.  Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.  I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR.  This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse  since then with the population of illegals.  Let's protect our future!

Maybe,you should do some type of executive order and stop this type of child abuse and nonsense ongoing in this country, Some of this is involved in immigration practices so men are able to come to this country and become legal citizens.,1/11/2019 Federal gov‚Äôt is encouraging child marriage Posted January 11, 2019	by Fraidy Reiss  Can you guess the minimum age for someone in the U.S. to petition for a foreign spouse or fianc√©(e)? Or for someone to be brought to the U.S. on a spousal or fianc√©(e) visa?  It‚Äôs zero. The federal government does not specify any minimum age for such petitions.  As a result, we at Unchained have seen girls under 18 forced to marry just so their overseas ‚Äúhusbands‚Äù can get U.S. visas. We also have seen girls brought to the U.S., legally, as child brides. Either way, the girls typically are raped and beaten within their ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù and not allowed to finish their education. All with the federal government‚Äôs approval.  Thanks to the AHA Foundation, which flagged this dangerous loophole and demanded data on the number of children impacted, we now know that between 2007 and 2017, more than 8,600 approved spousal/fianc√©(e) visa petitions involved a child. In 95 percent of those cases, the child was a girl.  We at Unchained lead the growing national movement to end child marriage in the U.S. Along with the National Coalition to End Child Marriage that we co-convened with Equality Now, we will continue to push for a minimum marriage age of 18 in every U.S. state and at the federal level. Please continue to support us as we do so.

Love the phrase protect, defend not ignore and let in.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
I agree, ignore piglosi go after the other dems.,Republican Congressmen and Republican Senators, all Republicans, need to forget Nancy and hound all the other democratic Congressmen and Senators.

Vickie Jarrett Cartledge I changed my sentence above from "crazed base" to "short-sighted" base. I was addressing his crazed base, the ones that "ignore" the fact Trump said multiple times that Mexico "will pay" for the border wall. He ran for President on that platform. I will wait for the President of Mexico to say they will pay for the wall. Now, as for as not nice to mention Trumps "crazed base", its interesting his base is OK with his life-long disgusting or "unflattering" comments and actions, many of those targeting women. We deserve better.,For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.
Vickie Jarrett Cartledge I repeated  your word ‚Äúshort-sighted‚Äù to only make you happy. No other reason‚Ä¶.I also used ‚Äúunflattering‚Äù, thinking that would be nice too. OK, so much for that. What Bill Clinton did while President has no reflection or parallel with the distress Trump has brought to our country as President of the US and ‚Äúleader of the free world‚Äú.  (Btw, I never voted for Bill Clinton and I‚Äôm still a registered Republican, which means nothing.) I vote and support who I think would make the best leader for our country.  Vickie, our allies don‚Äôt trust us anymore, that‚Äôs not leadership. Trump has eroded years of world goodwill and respect. Trump can‚Äôt manage his own administration. Four military Generals have left either by disgrace or opposition to Trumps erratic behavior and seat of the pants decisions. He flames the fire of division across our nation and the free world. He manages like a failed casino mobster. He‚Äôs a billionaire that‚Äôs filed bankruptcy 4 times, treats women and speaks of them and his sexual conquest like an immature 18 year old. Some of this and more ‚Äúbefore‚Äù anyone had the opportunity to vote for him.  Demos want border control that represent the values that most of us know and respect. Values that made our county the most admired in the world. Not a wall (I can add some adjectives but I‚Äòll be nice).  Yes, I agree that Trump never said he would negotiate with Mexico to build the wall. Trump said repeatedly that Mexico ‚Äúwill‚Äù pay for the wall. The guarantee that millions bought into and voted for him. Of course, three million more voters ‚Äúdid not‚Äù buy into his ridiculous promise.  On Feb. 16, 2016 then Mexican president Vicente Fox, flatly stated that Mexico will not pay for Trumps wall. I believed the former Mexican leader and still do.  The manufactured wall issue, which Trump ‚Äúwaited‚Äù to rally his base, is nothing more but another diversion from the Mueller investigation, which so far has placed a wall around some pretty bad hombres. And Flint still doesn‚Äôt have clean water.,For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.

Timothy Betts Thanks for your comment. You must hate humanity if you think what I spouted off is a good thing, or best for America. Trumps shut down of the government is something we are ALL going to pay for. I agree to disagree with your comments.,Day 27 of the tRump government shutdown. Trump has a tendency to propose wild ideas out loud and then repeat them before coming to his senses or getting talked off the ledge. An off-the-top-of-our head list: Leaving NATO. Bombing Iran. Death penalty for drug dealers. Birthright citizenship. Firing staff. Firing Mueller. Leaving the World Trade Organization. Blowing up Iranian fast boats in the Persian Gulf. Withdrawing troops and families from South Korea. Nationalizing a 5G network. Withdrawing from Syria, (just to name a few) you saw what happened yesterday. According to the Washington Post President Trump has made 6,420 false or misleading claims. That‚Äôs the President of the U.S. Let me say that AGAIN ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the President of the UNITED STATES‚Äù We‚Äôre living in the shameless society, where accountability and apology are just white flags for the weak.
Nick Baker quit listening to that fake news that CNN and MSN spew out . We the people elected Mr. Trump to build that wall. We the people want that wall for our safety , well being and the sake of our children.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Bruce Hale show us one Democrat that supports ISIS, or MS13, or illegal immigration. You plainly show your bias and hatred for those that are working to oppose Donald Trump, but show no compassion for those that Trump's government shutdown impacts more severely each day. How would you feel if you were forced to work unpaid for a month just so Donald Trump has a hostage to bargain with for his wall. You support a dealmaker who cares little for 800,000 civil servants and thousands of others who are working longer hours to keep things running without them. No true American or Christian could act so cruelly.,Build that wall & stand strong against the democrats who support ISIS, MS13, criminal aliens, 6 more years of the best president ever. Chuckie Nancy Maxine Waters Pocahontas & that evil stupid Cortez lady you will lose & you all can go to hell
Buck Strunk no other country has a wall around it. Canada, Russia, China, Brazil none has a border wall.,No other country has open borders why should we
Dave Boyer this is not a dictatorship. Trump cannot build his wall by the issuance of an executive order. He cannot raise or lower taxes. He cannot write laws. Congress under Republican control passed what he wanted for a tax cut. But even McConnell and Ryan did not get him his wall. They had the power, but did not. Because they did not want the wall.  Only Trump wants a wall, with his name on it. And he will starve good government employees and the country's poor retirees to get his way. How can you support that?,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Debbie Skinner your profile looks like Putins people created it. No facts on where you are from, work, or live. So dont be so quick to label those with opposing views as not being real. I worked for 51 years, paid my taxes and SS. Raised my kids to all work and pay taxes. I oppose the wall, support border security, am for more accessible ports of entry and better screening,  and am torally against the gov't shutdown. I blame Donald Trump for creating it, and Mitch McConnell for prolonging it by not allowing bipartisan legislation that has passed the house to even be put up for debate and a possible vote. He is now the biggest obstacle to reopening the government, not Shumer, not Pelosi.,Man you fake trolls are out there in full force but you are not the voice of the people, you are scum cowards hiding behind phony accounts! How‚Äôs the weather in Russia or is it China or in your Mom‚Äôs basement? Build the wall! BTW, your irreverent comments just unifies us even more and makes us stronger so knock yourselves out!
Judy Goebel you are thanking a man who stopped the pay and pay for 800,000 government employees and forces thousands of critical air traffic controllers to work unpaid. How do you sleep at night condoning such self centered evil?,Amen! Thank you for all you do.  Hang in there. We are counting on you.
Mark van Beek Just Trump imitating one of his Russian heroes.,You get it, walls don't work anyway.
Kristy Rodencal Goettl my vote counts, too. Build the wall.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Katy Chavez one by one just like hunting, everyone has to sleep sometime.,I know if my daughter was murdered by an illegal,  though I would probably  end up in hell I would have to seek vigilante revenge..
Benji Smith illegal immigrants is illegal already,  the name Ann is not, the name Ann ,is not costing The USA, billion each year, illegal immigrants are.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
I just reread your post ,dont really know what you are getting at.so if I offered you sorry.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed.

If it was your family member that died, you may feel differently about it.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Lisa Mannim retired from the Michigan department of corrections,  if done right ,the wall /fences ,would stop about 99% .I was in Israel before the wall was built, they had weekly bus bombings, after wall built bus bombings stopped,  then they built a wall ,along Egyptian border, where thousands were entering illegally, know there was only 16 people get across, wall work if built right, and manned right. Thank you.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Tammy Zaluzney I was in Israel before they built the walls, almost weekly bus bombings, after wall built bus bombings stopped,  Israel boarder with Egypt, has thousands crossing, wall built 16 is all that got in , if built right walls and fences, work ,I'm retired from the Michigan department of corrections,  I know a little about the suspect.,No they don't.  Ask the ancient Chinese.  Ask Berlin.  Ask Rome.  They all fail in the end.  This would fail immediate, as the issue in not at the border and you know it.  Stop lying to people.  You have no intention of building a wall.  You're just trying to save face while distracting from the hits the economy keep taking, the deficit blow up, and the Russia collusion case.  No one with a shred of sense believes you Donny.  #TraitorTrump #NationalDisgrace
you dont live near the boarder,, where these fucking illegals , steel anything they can get their hands on..break into your house..or your car,cause damage to the towns near by..and the insurance companies keep raising their rates for every claim you make...just to mention the little things they do,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Maths?,Every day illegals are arrested in Atlanta for stealing, selling drugs or I think you knew I meant meth, I guess I am not perfect. Suffered stroke and brain and fingers are‚Äôt together working.

Only a moron would believe Mexico would pay for a wall. But then again, if you think Trump is good for America, describing you as a moron is far too kind ;),Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!

Sandy Theriault , lol building a wall to protect US citizens doesn't violate our rights. Do you really think people will just do nothing if they try to take away our right to bear arms. There wil be civil war if that happens. And I'm guessing the side with weapons will probably win.,Sandy hook, San Bernardino, Parkland and just yesterday in Illinois?? So lets now focus on gun control!! Thank #45 for opening up national emergency - trump did set a precedent, there can now be real gun control via national emergency new guidelines just set!!

I guess you didn't see the latest in the senate, as they tried to block a removal of sanctions against a Russian Oligarch. Or his comment, that Russia was justified in the invasion of Afghanistan, or his taking and hiding the translator notes from his talks with Putin, or....etc etc. Your description of mainstream media as garbage indicates you, yourself, have a raging case of Coprophagia. Wise up, Mr. Green. The hour is late.,Wish you'd spend as much time defending us as you do Russia.
Your felon in chief will face serious charges, as have his cohort. Mueller is careful and thorough, and we shall see what he has when he is ready. There is proof. The investigators are not partisan. My 'side' is the one using the constitution, seeking truth, and considering everything. Your invective is not persuasive, and would be an embarrassment to you, if you were capable of being embarrassed.,Wish you'd spend as much time defending us as you do Russia.

AW Sylwester The answers are YES.  Free elections?  Really?  You REALLY went there?  YOU are as ignorant as they come.  Go drink more of the Hillary Obama Koolaide !!!!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Stan Piznarski Maybe the President with the help of Congress can designate an easement of the much of the border as one long protected National Park or Monument and then legally use funds to protect the vegetation of the parks with a wall, due to ecological impacts from Illegal immigrants destroying the protected lands. An existing example of something similar to this would be the Roosevelt Reservation.,Thank you America for electing him üåüüíØüå∑‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üíãüá∫üá∏

The trump party is the party of ignorant lemmings.,The other party is the party of Benghazi and they have a similar policy for America.  Lets roll! SHUT THEM DOWN and send our people the support they request before they're overrun.
You don‚Äôt need to apologize to trump supporters; they‚Äôre idiots, they don‚Äôt know any difference.,What are you waiting for? Who's running this country? You have the power to protect this country, without the approval of the Democrats. DECLARE AN EMERGENCY! GET THE JOB DONE!
And you idiots call yourselves patriotic Americans who want to rid America of its actual institutions of democracy.,Tell Mitch to change the rules to cut off debate!

Andrew Vincent,   1) either be proactive or reactive about immigration. Your entire foundation is reactive because it doesn‚Äôt come with a better plan   2) meet halfway? You mean by Pelosi and Schumer saying no wall is meeting halfway?   3) I put Mexico paying for the wall in the same bucket with shovel ready jobs and affordable healthcare. Mine is now $1,440 per month and I have bern taking it on the chin for years. Some ideas just can‚Äôt be fulfilled! Let‚Äôs not act like politicians haven‚Äôt failed us in the past!,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andrew Vincent, last century? Unless you also live in a last century house, technology has improved all we build, even using sensors to help see tunnels and other things. To use a medieval analogy isn‚Äôt being very truthful   But how do you process people legally if they can walk in undetected nearly everywhere? Plus how do you guarantee work for amounts of immigrants you can‚Äôt control their entry?,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andrew Vincent, no one said there was one solution to fix illegal immigration. But the wall will be a beginning.   While it‚Äôs not your job to be proactive, it is the job of Americans to evaluate what solutions our representatives come up with to see if it is feasible and makes sense. Isn‚Äôt it how we evaluate coworkers and even family members, to say nothing of ourselves?   Pelosi said on tape she will oppose Trump‚Äôs wall. Now she did use some nebulous references about some kind of barrier in certain places. But in February 2018, wasn‚Äôt it Pelosi who said we should cut the grass instead?   You want to talk about a sales pitch? You mean like passing the ACA even without fully reading it? Are you serious?,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andrew Vincent, ok, let‚Äôs examine all you said...  1) by not having a better solution other than a wall, you‚Äôd rather take a pragmatic approach and do nothing. This means illegal immigration, which costs anywhere between 54-125 billion annually not only continues, but grows in expense. Do you think such a response will increase, decrease, or have no affect on 22 trillion in debt?   2) what does ‚Äúenhanced border security‚Äù mean? Democrats can‚Äôt even come up with a number of how many agents would be required, much less generate an annual expense.   3) I‚Äôd rather spend 30 billion today on a wall, about 10% of the interest alone on our debt (that no American benefits from) to possibly curb the obvious increase in illegal immigration costs. Then if years later, some resident genius comes up with a better solution, then let‚Äôs go for it!,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andrew Vincent, then what you are saying is you aren‚Äôt interested in Pelosi or Schumer taking some of the 54 billion in discretionary spending available to fix the water issues in flint? If not, what would you like them to do with the money?,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andrew Vincent, yes and 5.7 billion is only 1/60th of the annual interest of 22 trillion in debt,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andy Jenkinson, then couldn‚Äôt those same electronics be used in concert with a wall to stop those from entering illegally? Remember there is more than one problem, which then require more than one solution,5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
Andy Jenkinson, then if drug barons will use micro lights to fly over the border, then your solution to add more agents wouldn‚Äôt solve the problem either, would it?,5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
Christina Maschmeyer, I wouldn‚Äôt say there is that type of disparity, but due to the Trump supporters who remain silent each and every week, I‚Äôd think it could be mote around the 2-4% range.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.

Jeramy Felton Hargis, why is it anti Trump people can‚Äôt even see the noses on their own faces? You have this idea a wall is only a physical structure, but with seismic instruments, drones, and other technologies, it becomes a smart wall. Of course there are still other areas to address, but a wall is a good beginning   As far as homeless and flint goes, doesn‚Äôt Pelosi have 54 billion in discretionary expenses? Why not send some of that money to those concerns?  Also, Trump is asking for about 1/60th of the annual interest that accrued on 22 trillion in debt.

Patrick Sciarratta, you indicated Trump is seeing a 7 point drop in about 45 or so days, which is a very misleading statistic. Polling is best extrapolated over long periods of time to obtain a true representative sample of enough data.   In December 2017, Trump had an average approval rating of 37% and it slowly increased to a high of about 43.3 in about April 2018 or so. Since that high, Trump has been his numbers fluctuate between a low of 41% to a high of nearly 44%. Statistically speaking, since the shutdown was imminent, Trump has lost about 1.3% to date   However, congress as a whole has taken a hit as well. They had an average between 19.8% to a high of about 20.7 in the same 6 - 8 month time frame as Trump. Today their approval is at 19.3, or about a loss of around 0.6 - 0.8%, or about half of Trump‚Äôs loss   But the shutdown doesn‚Äôt affect Trump nearly as bad as if he capitulated to Pelosi and Schumer. For if he did, he would lose many of his base sooner. Therefore he would have lost followers regardless. But as long as voters are lowering congress as well, at least he isn‚Äôt the only one taking a hit.,Serious, Real News: My Client Resigned From the White House.

Paul Chiplock, let me ask you a question about this immigration on the border being at a decline.

How do you account for someone in a statistical way you never saw or otherwise discovered after the fact?   Why do you think there is such a big range in calculating the overall cost of illegal immigration? It‚Äôs from a low of 54 billion to a high of almost 175 billion.

Why would the 69 year old continue to lie and inevitably choose to die in prison? Keeping his boss out of it and hoping for a presidential pardon perhaps. I don‚Äôt know but Special Counsel Robert Mueller does. üòè
Philip Mueller, why don‚Äôt walls work? If they don‚Äôt work, why do we see so many all over America?,Walls are stupid, they dont work. Almost all crime is committed by American citizens. How about gun control if you care about our family? What's that? You cant hear me over the sound of counting the 30 million dollars NRA gave you?
Robin Barnhill, Democrats would screw up a wet dream if they understood what one was,Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Robin Barnhill, I agree! Schumer is a liar and would never want to be accountable for his inaction and deceitfulness,Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Robin Barnhill, actually, I‚Äôm totally fine keeping the government shut down indefinitely,Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Robin Barnhill, but since you say Trump can‚Äôt be trusted, then you accept you couldn‚Äôt trust him to reopen the government either? That means you also accept a very long government shutdown,Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Robin Barnhill, no matter what you say, even omitting such a comment doesn‚Äôt get the government reopened. Isn‚Äôt that what you are upset about?,Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Shawn Timmons, are you kidding? We have congress with a 19.3% average approval rating while Trump is at 41.4%. But then it‚Äôs Trump who is unfit? Who is unfit are the myriad of insincere politicians who take great care when they talk by not really trying to say anything in the process,Bob Segal
Shawn Timmons, that‚Äôs fine! Then don‚Äôt bitch about the shutdown. Trump can wait, and wait, and wait.....,Bob Segal
Shawn Timmons, why don‚Äôt walls work? We already know why so many liberals don‚Äôt work.,Bob Segal
Tony Sherrard, we will leave that to the democrats,Bob Segal Democrats read books - you should try it sometime.
I am not sure I am following your thought here..."39000 killed by American Citizens" OK and? We should ignore any addition from illegals because...?,39000 killed by US citizens with guns
Scared of...? YES!! Armed Demoncrat THUGS. We ARE working on that...,Donald Trump just needs to take a trip to Chicago  ‚Äú oh wait I forgot, he‚Äôs too scared‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Question: Which Party Platform is egotistical and which is Altruistic in nature? Politics are very simple to understand. There is a balance in between "The needs of the many out-way the needs of a few" AND "A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link" If we find the sweet spot in those two things we will live in heaven on earth. President Trump is thee closest we have come to this line of thinking in our history as a country.,Tony Perez, we've got our fair share too.
William Bush wtf,How about safety in schools‚Äîoh yeah you said you would send prayers.
What comes through the legal entrances can be controled and tracked because they have security.  Things that come through an unsecure border can not.,You better worry what's coming through our airports and ports of entry
Go back to history class.  The Berline wall divided a country that did not want to be divided.  Our American wall will divide two different countries that want to be divided.  See the difference or are you still blind with hate.,build the wall, it worked great in Berlin
Study the life of Christ and then think about what you just said.,Bobb Marly my brother these are the days of coming of Christ i meant it in a way where as life isnt meant to be thiz way God bless you. I walk with Christ
wow man go back to history class.  The Berline wall divided a country and neither side wanted to be divided.  Our American wall will divide two seperate coutnries who want to be seperate countries.,Bobb Marly the point was, did the wall solve any problems, and if so, why does it not exist today?

BUILD THE DAMN WALL,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
HILLARY LOST IS THE DEMOCRAPS PROBLEM. Running scared with all the skeletons in their closets !,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.

Bill Klein So can the idiots who are blocking what we want...you might take notice that this country voted Donald Trump into office..whether, or not, you want to believe it...it's true. We voted him into office because of the platform he ran on.  I can't imagine what kind of trouble this country would be in if the big cities made all of our decisions.  Thank God for the electoral college.,I still don‚Äôt want a wall- didn‚Äôt 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.

Term limits for everyone in Washington, not just our presidents.,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them. We see this in the recent drama from Buzzfeed. Absolutely amazing the reaction they had before they knew the truth and now after they know the truth. It‚Äôs a COMPLETE MELT DOWN.  WHAT A F‚Äî‚ÄîD up way to live!!!
He drove they let him across. The border patrol is part of the problem wall won‚Äôt work Military,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL

Tell that to Pelosi and  Schumer.,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Danny Jones Thank you for the kind thought.  This American really understands your anguish. It seems our culture is also being destroyed. Our President is trying with all his might to stop that from taking place.  I sincerely hope brexit goes though for the UK and that ‚ÄúWE‚Äù get  our border wall.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
How do we tell you to get lost look at our country and the people who can‚Äôt afford to feed their children and pay their mortgage but yet that‚Äôs ok according to the Democratic Party because it was one of them that ordered that into law fuckin Obama care nothing the Democratic Party has done has benefited the American people why didn‚Äôt they impeach Clinton because oh I forgot he was a democrat but yet they want to impeach trump last time I checked he hadn‚Äôt shooved a cigar up any young interns vagina and said he didnt do it when he did like Clinton the Democratic Party has embarrrassed this country to the fullest and no one likes any of them. And they need to go al they do is rob and steal the American people blind,How do we tell Nancy and Shurmer we want them to resign I think that should be a petition all Americans should be able to sign also because every where I go it's all I hear people saying they.  Want these two idiots out
I assume you & those who share your feelings are opening your homes to a dozen "refugees" each.  YOU get to pay their bills - food, clothes, medicine, job training, cell phones, cars - whatever they want.  Let me know how that works out.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Max, you need to study up on the differences among socialism, capitalism, fascism & communism.  I recommend Ebenstein's book on the four isms.  First published in 1963.  Check Amazon.  The wall has nothing to do with socialism!,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
Mark van Beek , why do wealthy politicans and movie stars have walls and gates surrounding their homes.,You're gonna feel betrayed when it's YOUR turn in the GULAG!
Abby Schmidt they are indirectly through tariffs.,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Adam Ben Mexico will pay, think about it. ..its gonna cost them when that wall goes up....,Americans says no more lies, you said Mexico will pay for, so!!!

So I support the wall 100%!!

Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin You keep saying the same stupid crap. You keep calling Trump a liar.... Should we go back to all the lies Obummer fed us??? "If you like your plac you can keep it".... Funny how your party was all for a wall before........... You all just hate not being in power and getting to shove your ideology down our throats.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Jim LaMuth it‚Äôs Presidents‚Äô Day weekend idiot.

What is the emergency?  And how is your administration responding to it? By golfing?
You are aware that the Mayor of Flint took money given to her to fix the water and donated it to a super PAC right?,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that‚Äôs where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don‚Äôt see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That‚Äôs unacceptable.  Anyway, I‚Äôm done discussing it.  If üá∑üá∫ doesn‚Äôt interfere,  üòâ I‚Äôm sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
Ah, why is it that every time I discuss anything. Every right winger brings up "black on black crime in chicago". Do you even know the circumstances leading up to the massive crime in that area? Do you know the history? Because it starts with right wing policies. Since gun control measures in Chicage, crime has seen a steady decrease yearly. So we started there. What's your point? Is a wall going to keep you safe, definitely not. Not when the major terrorists in this nation are home-grown of the white right wing variety.,There are far more stories of white right wing men doing a mass shooting.
No they aren't Palo. Show me the data and I'll show you why you're wrong.,There are far more stories of white right wing men doing a mass shooting.
Brenda De Boer-Davidson literally the first President in my lifetime that has followed through on a majority of their campaign promises,Thank you for following through on your promises!
Trump OWNS the shutdown üëç he said he would OWN it himself,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid

No I‚Äôm not for or against especially to protect crooked politicians , but what I am against is falsely claiming your patriotism is the reason you‚Äôre doing something when that billions of dollars of money could go to things that would immediately effect Americans daily life‚Äôs, and then to top it off thousands of people are being effected by something they can‚Äôt even control and may bit wvwn belive in all due to one mans agenda, I cannot call that patriotic or love of a country.,And if you don‚Äôt look out for your citizens?? At what point does one outweigh another. You truly can‚Äôt say you care about America when there is so many people working for the government, your government, not getting paid....I mean come on
Elizabeth Burton Steere smart people don‚Äôt fight against their own argument. She has stated multiple times that we need border security.

Jim Butkowsky that‚Äôs just if if that illegal person had not been here her daughter would be alive. #buildthewall,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.

Jacqueline George , I‚Äôm sure you are aware of our 60 Billion + dollar trade deficit with Mexico each year.  What if President Trump made an agreement with Mexico to lower tariffs for US goods shipped there? Saving America that 60 Billion?

Nope. That's just a nice convenient position that sound reasonable, but the hard truth and argument against that relaxed attitude is, that if that was the case, the wall could have been erected by now, based on an agreement made long ago. The socalled "gun" you so highly claim has in fact just been drawn recently.  It's a bit two-tongued...first denying making any agreement at all under any circumstances. Then denying making any agreement, because of "a gun" and claiming, that a deal could have been made if the "gun" hasn't been drawn.. Come on,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Seven percent of the illegals crossing our southern border end up in our prison's.  We don't need to import more problems !,I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
Danny Jones it won't matter. Within one more generation the Muslims will have bred themselves into a majority in the UK, and your "culture" will be gone forever anyway.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Hal Eric Mitlitsky you're a moron! If it stops just one, that might be the one that would have killed your daughter or son. Stop listening to CNN,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Hal Eric Mitlitsky if there ever will be another democratic president. All the reasons you just mentioned are reasons why there shouldn't ever be one again.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
The aggregate world debt is 238 trillion dollars, with cyber security threats adding a trillion dollars a year to that alone. Unsustainable.,The only question that remains now is, have the Democrats fundamentally transformed America enough, to accept that we do not hang people anymore for, High Treason.

DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old. Here are 30 ways Americans are feeling the pain:  1. 450,000 public workers are being made to work without pay, including members of the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, Border Patrol, FBI, and Secret Service. 2. 350,000 public workers have been temporarily laid off. 3. Tens of thousands of federal contractors have been laid off for a month, including janitors, security guards, and cafeteria workers. They are losing up to $200 million a day. It is unlikely that they will ever receive pay for the time they have missed. 4. Nearly 10,000 companies that do business with the U.S. government are losing money, according to the Washington Post. 5. Pop-up food banks have opened up to feed unpaid government workers. 6. The four week shutdown is costing the U.S. $200 million a day, or almost $6 billion so far according to analysis by The New York Times. 7. Unpaid TSA workers have been calling in 'sick' or quitting, leading to longer security lines and missed flights. Some airports have begun closing terminals. 8. The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9. Air Traffic Controllers, who were already suffering a 30-year staffing low, have been feeling the strain of going unpaid. Some have begun quitting. 10. With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21. The FTC's identity theft reporting system is shut down. 22. Student loans are being delayed as universities are unable to verify parents' income with the IRS 23. Small Business Administration loans have been delayed. 24. Domestic violence shelters that receive federal funds have been forced to cut services. 25. Highway and transit projects are being delayed or canceled. 26. Wildfire preparations in western states are delayed. 27. The National Hurricane Center's research has been delayed 28. The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo are closed. 29. Funding for Section 8 housing assistance has lapsed, placing low-income families at risk of eviction. 30. Civil cases in federal court have been delayed. Lawsuits against Donald Trump in federal court are on hold.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
,Donald Trump you will get the wall and a lot more.  And of course, Pelosi and Schumer will take credit for it.  Obama will say he orchestrated it back when he was just a freshman chimp.  But who cares, you're getting the wall.

Christopher Goodwin I agree...we need more gun laws,We have more mass shootings than all other countries combined and you do nothing, but three people were killed by illegal immigrants last year and it‚Äôs a national emergency?
Jamie Bennett I agree! What does he care about?,Make no mistake, Trump couldn't care less about Americans.  You're a fool if you believe his lies.
,A human killed ur daughter it has absolutely nothing to do with wether he was illegal or not.
Melissa Lamphere just how many is a  few bad people?,Actually, it isn't. They've repaired a little existing wall, but no new wall has been started. Do a little research. Also, spellcheck is a thing now.
Melissa Lamphere so what you're saying then is you want to foster/sponsor a family of illegals? Now remember no background check of any kind. Just open your door. Let'em right in to your home. I love how awesome of a person you are.,Actually, it isn't. They've repaired a little existing wall, but no new wall has been started. Do a little research. Also, spellcheck is a thing now.
Paul Karachia ever climbed a wall?,Mr president wall don't work , that's a waste of funds, take care of the veterans. This way you will always be great.
Tony Connelly how many die from drug OD from drugs smuggled across the southern border?,Eric Helmes  Yes, put Trump in jail for knowingly hiring illegals first.   But it‚Äôs not even an issue. Historically illegal migration ebbs and flows according to economic need.  Right now it‚Äôs in deep decline and has been due to low unemployment.  This isn‚Äôt even in the top 100 issues we should be focusing on.   But, you know, campaign promises an all.

Ahmad Mahmoud it is not a beauty pageant.  Trump is doing what he was elected to do.,You‚Äôre the ugliest president ever
Carl M√∂rner we will have guards patrolling the area.  I would like a minefield but I do not see that getting approved.,Well as I understand it the wall is primarily built to stem the rotating flow of 400.000 deportations and illegal entries every year. The berlin wall and the soviet/russian border towards finland required guardtowers,minefields,troops,dogs etc to be efficient.
Jackie Lee Collins American prisons are filled with Americans.  And?  You think because we have criminals here we should invite more criminals to come here?     Were you born this stupid or did you have to work at it?,And a US citizen shot up Columbine, Shot up Parkland, don't get me started on Eric Robert Rudolph, or Ted Bundy. American Terrorist attack at the 96 Olympics in Atl. Yeah our prisons are filled with Americans. Whats your excuse now? Try again.
Karen Breunig and?  So we have murderers her and you think that means we should welcome murderers to come here?  Nope,A man just slaughtered 5 innocent people in Illinois. He was angry American male... AGAIN
Kathy Finley Hayden and that is an issue to deal with.  That does not mean we can ignore other problems.,How about all the children killed on schools?  It is always horrible when a child is killed...but we also have home grown terrorists.
Charlesetta Brown yes, Obama had 8 quarters that had over 3% GDP.  The other 24 were horrible and he never had 3%+ annual GDP.   Obama pumped money into the economy.  He invested how many billions into green companies?  Almost everyone of them was bankrupt within six months.     Obama had unemployment going down yet at the same time so was job market participation rate, it hit a 40 year low.  People were not finding jobs, they were just getting taken off the roles.   Obama lowered taxes?  The Supreme Court ruled that the ACA was a tax, this giving Obama the largest tax increase in the history of the US.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Charlesetta Brown CNN/Money stated that Obama oversaw the worst recovery in the history of the US.  Only president to never see 3%+ annual GDP and that was with the Fed keeping interest rates at 0% for almost all of Obama's 8 years.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Katie Ander I do read and you did not counter one thing I said.  You just come in with a condescending attitude.   Trump went bankrupt with so many of his companies? Yes, he has had 6 companies declare bankruptcy, pretty good considering he has over 100.   Maybe you should try doing a little research into actual data instead of looking for journalists to spoon feed you.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Tyler Rogozinski except you neglect consumer and investor confidence with has an immediate effect.  Obama did everything he could to stop any growth and told people straight up "1-2% is the new normal, get use to it."  Trump says "4% is good, let's try for 5 or 6%",Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Kelly Anders wow, really?  50% of violent crime in America is committed by 13% of the population and they ain't white.,As a gay woman I worry more about white men than brown men
Kenny Shuster except that the boots on the ground at the border said they need it..,The Wall is a figment and an fixation of Trump's sick twisted narcissistic mind! Mr. President!! Get help!!
Kimberly Mansfield compare those killed in mass shooting per year to the number killed by illegal aliens every year.     As for money to help people, illegal aliens cost the US $100+ billion every year.,This is sad but shouldn't be America's main focus there was ANOTHER mass shooting yesterday done by an American! Many people killed many hurt!
Margo Smith really?  Where do you get that information?  Did you know 50% of the violent crime in America is committed by 13% of the population.  That 13% ain't white.,White American men kill the most Americans every year. True fact. What keeps me safe from them?
Matthew Mastrogiovanni HP funny, all those things were around when Obama declared national emergencies.     And why do you focus on white supremacist and not racists of every color?,How about this state of emergency?  White Supremists, big polluters, pedophile priests and the like, are threats to the American Way: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and should be treated as traitors of America.
Meren Tinu I have worked with military from 80 different countries, there is no military on earth that does more to insure innocent people are not killed.,American arms and armed forces kills families in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and probably Venezuela and Iran too. So all those mentioned countries will allied either China or Russia to protect their beloved families.
Mike Caffes if you can find one then contact your local police department and give them the evidence.,How many sons and daughters has trump killed
Stacey Britton fear mongering?  You mean like when democrats said if Trump was elected the stock market would crash and possibly never recover?  Or them screaming that Trump would start a nuclear war?  Or that he would take away woman's rights, black rights, gay rights?     All democrats have is fear mongering.,Who exactly??? Because stats don't support a barrier wall.
Stacey Britton listening to boots on the ground and fighting to give them what they need.,Who exactly??? Because stats don't support a barrier wall.
Temicka Brown funny, you do not blame the democrats running Flint .  They get money to deal with the water crisis and divert it to keeping democrats in office and their pet projects they get kick backs on.  But everyone else is suppose to fix the problem.    Grow up.,So what makes you think a damn wall will keep out illegals?

And this is why crazy people need to be monitored more closely,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Angela Lynne pawns ?? So tell me , your husband works at a prison ?? They have walls right ? Big ones ? Razor fence ? Armed security ?? Hmmmmmm sage thing our border needs .. once it happens for us all , then the shutdown will be over,Please open the government.

Dave Callender Moronic comments.....,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Well thats true of any country except for sweden where the majority of crime is committed by immigrants from the middleeast etc. The same thing is happening in france,germany and england sadly.,Well as I understand it the wall is primarily built to stem the rotating flow of 400.000 deportations and illegal entries every year. The berlin wall and the soviet/russian border towards finland required guardtowers,minefields,troops,dogs etc to be efficient.

One of the central theses of this feed has been that Trump had a legal obligation to do nothing to aid/abet Russian cybercrimes after August 17, 2016, when he received his first classified briefing as a candidate and learned of Putin's cyberwar. Today we learned he did just that.  Today we learned that Trump was discussing unilateral sanctions relief with the Kremlin (via Sessions) *and* floating the idea of a gifted $50 million penthouse in Moscow for Putin (via Cohen and Sater) *and* negotiating a massive Trump Tower Moscow deal post-August 17, 2016. The focus of the collusion conversation has always been exclusively conspiracy. In Proof of Collusion I argued that two dozen crimes could be collusive; then, once Ben Wittes said obstruction could be collusion, everyone took note. Well aiding and abetting is *also* collusion.  Remember that what we call the Trump-Rozov deal (the 2015 Trump Tower Moscow deal, as opposed to the 2013 Trump-Agalarov deal) was being negotiated *with the Kremlin*. You *cannot* learn that Putin is in a hot cyberwar with America and keep negotiating a deal with the Kremlin.  Remember that, as of August 17, 2016, Donald Trump was one of the few civilians in the *world* with a legally cognizable level of certainty that the Kremlin was engaged in a hot cyberwar against America. His obligations from then on were therefore *special* and *justiciable*. The only reason Giuliani was willing to admit today that Trump was negotiating with the Kremlin up until Election Day is that media has so doggedly (but wrongly) said that conspiracy is the only collusion charge relevant to Mueller's probe that Trump's team came to believe it.  I think the problem that we're going to have now is that media is so invested in this grave misconception of how to use the term "collusion" in discussing Mueller's work that there's a chance the full import of what Rudy confessed to today will be missed and not reported upon.  The important thing is this: if Giuliani is willing to say this publicly, it means he's either certain Mueller already has this information from another source, or sure that information at *least* this bad about the Trump-Kremlin negotiations is certain to come out eventually. when I say "today we learned" I don't actually mean "today we learned." Readers of this feed and readers of Proof of Collusion already knew about Trump's aiding and abetting. What I mean is "today all America learned."-,I still don‚Äôt want a wall- didn‚Äôt 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can‚Äôt fool everyone. Open the government !
T-Mobile announced a merger needing Trump administration approval. The next day, 9 executives had reservations at Trump‚Äôs hotel.------------------Nothing to see here, folks.

Rudy's claim that Trump, if he spoke to Cohen, spoke only about Cohen's impending testimony‚Äîwhich *Trump had no reason to disbelieve*‚Äîis a *nonsense*. Cohen spoke to Trump *ten times* about the Trump-Rozov deal. Trump *knew* whether Cohen's planned testimony was going to be true.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
The House overwhelmingly passes resolution disapproving of Russia sanctions relief, 362-53, a symbolic rebuke of Trump admin decision.  There were 136 Republicans who supported the measure and 53 opposed--And just to be clear: This won't stop the sanctions from being lifted because the measure failed in the Senate,No other country has open borders why should we
this was going to be a Theresa May style Brexit deal. Hated by both sides. Trump further revealed as the impotent architect of his own continuing failure.- The deal Trump‚Å© offered Sat pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs...nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
I used to joke that the best evidence the President is not an asset of the Russians is that his policies have been so pro-Russian that even the Russians would tell him, "slow down, you're being too obvious.‚Äù  But the damage done to our security is no joke, and demands an answer.,I feel so sad that you Mr. President have to take so much from the CORRUPT and EVIL Dems, but I THANK YOU for Putting Our Country FIRST !!!!
The thing about the wall that‚Äôs hurting Trump with his base isn‚Äôt the shutdown or the stalemate.

"I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it.",Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
He is not just ignorant--which could be the case for a smart person or one of average intelligence who was just too lazy to learn.  He is not just allergic to facts because they tend to undermine his worldview and reveal his cons and his crimes. He is actually a full-fledged nitwit who is as unfamiliar with logic, sound reasoning, true insight, a sense of consequences, the relevance of context, as he is with ethics, or values or taste.  Yes, he is a traitor and a criminal and a vile hateful person. But we must always remember that which he reminds of every time he opens his mouth or Tweets his Tweets.  He is dope, a maroon, a useful idiot to some and a dangerous idiot when it comes to all the rest of us.  He is a dim bulb who has left us all stumbling around in is darkness. Time to flip on the lights America and see this guy for who he is and for what he is not.  Later we can determine the role dementia or drugs or lack of education or arrogance or just bad genes played in the creation of this pinheaded ninny of a cretinous nincompoop. But for now, as you weigh our circumstances and likely outcomes, always remember, it is not just bad character or greed or evil at work here...though they too are all present.  It is that our president is also just plain dumb.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
As today and yesterday and this entire shutdown episode have revealed the president is not just corrupt or disloyal or hateful or incompetent or unfit to hold the office.  He is also stupid.  That's not something we say in polite political debate.  But it's a fact.--,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited

Rudy Giuliani tells Chuck Todd on 'Meet the Press' that President Trump 'can remember having conversations' with Michael Cohen about Trump Tower Moscow right up until the election‚Äîas late as November of 2016----If Trump Tower Moscow negotiations continued to Nov., statements candidate Trump made in late July (where he used the present tense) were lies:  ‚ÄúI have nothing to do with Russia.

Trump looked to Russia as it carved up Ukraine, killed airline passengers, murdered dissidents and said, I want to build a skyscraper there with the Kremlin's help while I run for president. And he lied about it straight into the White House.   None of that's changed.,Just do an executive order and be done with it

Well the Manafort judge certainly doesn‚Äôt see any witch hunt here!   She says Konstantin Kilimnik is significant to the Mueller investigation because he was a link between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
He. Doesn‚Äôt. Care.--Not one word in President Trump's speech to or about the 800,000 affected federal workers, who are increasingly feeling the pain of this shutdown as it stretches into its fifth week,you go Donald J. Trump President....Secure our borders now....please!
Worth reminding folks that Trump could have had $25 billion for border security a year ago. But Trump, using an all-or-nothing approach, also demanded steep cuts in LEGAL immigration as well. So he wound up with nothing,you go Donald J. Trump President....Secure our borders now....please!
No emergency, for sure.

Im fine with Trump's proposal of temporary protection  for DREAMers for 3 years in exchange for the wall, if the wall also is only protected for 3 years.

It is normal, democratic, American politics for the executive and legislative branches of government to bargain & negotiate over competing policy preferences. It is not normal, democratic, or American for the paychecks of workers to be held hostage while doing so.,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
THIS is a key point not enough people have been making.   Under questioning Trump *actively hid from U.S. intelligence what he'd been doing*. And if Flynn knew any of what Trump was doing, so did he, as he was in the classified briefing with Trump on August 17, 2016.  And didn‚Äôt report either the deal or the contacts as the FBI requested in their security briefing, and lied about both  In that briefing, U.S. intel was *also* informing Trump that the Russians were going to try to infiltrate his campaign to influence him. It's evident that those statements (plus questions) were intended to provoke disclosures from Trump about whether any such effort had begun. Beyond having spoken to the briefers, Mueller would know from Flynn exactly what Trump said during that meeting, in other words how many lies he told to law enforcement bout his contacts with the Kremlin. And those lies, told during a criminal investigation, would be *crimes*.  That's why I have Making False Statements on the list of "collusive crimes" (in this particular fact-pattern, i.e. the Trump-Russia investigation). Because that's almost certainly what Trump did on August 17, 2016 and Mueller would have multiple witnesses to confirm it by now.,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!

We're going to assume Rudy Giuliani was ALLEGEDLY drunk (again) when he went on CNN last night to walk back the whole NO COLLUSION narrative that Trump and Co. have been peddling for the past two years.

Pencil pushers are starting to freak out about Trump's shutdown, warning that if federal workers miss another paycheck, a drop in economic growth coupled with the loss of consumer and business confidence, combined with Trump's trade war and the long term sting on consumer credit ratings, could trigger a recession. Lucky for Trump, who gauges his success on the ebbs and flows of stock market, Wall Street's 1% hasn't noticed rank-and-file federal workers are on the verge of quitting en masse.  Trump's 2020 campaign manager and pubic beard-in-chief, Brad Parscale, says that they have all this polling data that says they're winning the war on messaging, but he refuses to show anybody. I guess Parscale's model is from a different school three towns over, and isn't available right now because it's currently vacationing in Russia.,Terry Clark what's Hillary got to do with anything. That shipped sailed long ago. You guys need a new tune....lol
I'll take a thousand migrants willing to walk 2,000 miles across a desert in hopes of a making a better life in America over one privileged smirking insolent snot-nose MAGA hat-wearing teenage dipshit asshole any day of the week and twice on Sunday,Todd Schroeder shame on you
btw. the House controls the Federal Budget. If you had the first clue about how your own government functions, you would know that.,Todd Schroeder shame on you
What we didn‚Äôt hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the Trump Shutdown.,Cut the Senator‚Äôs and Congessmen‚Äôs pay during the shutdown and things will start to work your way
Danny Jones  How is EU membership destroying your culture Danny? Twat,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Danny Jones  Quote Great British culture. I'm a Brit. The EU hate us. End of. So I'd rather we gave the USA 5 billion as a gift for the wall rather than give 39 billion a year to the EU ...  You haven‚Äôt really answered any questions - just added more illiterate drivel.  What is your view of the ‚Äògreat British culture‚Äô and how has EU membership eroded it?  Do answer with specifics if you can. Why do you think the EU hate us? They certainly don‚Äôt want us to leave but they‚Äôre not going to compromise their membership tenets to suit the U.K. - we already have a good deal. How would gifting ¬£5billion to the US benefit the U.K. as much as membership to the EU has?  I doubt you‚Äôll be able or willing to answer any of the above - just like Trump supporters, you‚Äôre not that bright and completely misinformed.  Twats like you shouldn‚Äôt have the vote.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Elena Pate   You state stay strong and the UK will prosper.  Interesting comment Elana - clearly you know something about international trade and economics that has eluded everyone else. Care to share? How will the U.K. prosper outside of the worlds largest trading bloc?   I‚Äôm really interested in your reply.  ‚ÄòThe EU is the world's biggest exporter of manufactured goods and services, and it is the biggest import market for over 100 countries. It is also the world's largest single market area‚Äô,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Apple Rivera  GB was stable before joining the EU? You really are ignorant of fact. Unbelievable. Why comment on something you clearly have no knowledge of - you just make yourself look incredibly stupid.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Maik Schrank Yes, pay more taxes, support more illegals. I think not,Eric Wroblewski thank you
I call bullshit. .,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Diane Ruckdeschel They are part of that criminal enterprise, so get over it.,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Justin Dewey 74% of the voters want the wall.,All about the framing POTUS! Poll Americans and ask "Do you want a secure border?" Obviously the response will be overwhelmingly "Yes".

David Lindquist  ..handled just fine?  Yeah right...they're still busing them into Texas under the cover of night and escorted by local cops...because Democrat funded immigration lawyers are defending them and getting them.  Idiot!,

You seriously are.,Heartbreaking story, I am so sorry for this family's loss. Thank you President Trump for giving them their voice that Beto wants to keep silenced.

The dictator is a fascist and and a crook and will be in prison soon.,THE PRESIDENT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!!!!!!!!
I don't understand the level of insanity from you idiot Trumpers who, after every mass shooting in the U.S. by a U.S. citizen, claim that "gun control doesn't work; a criminal will find a way to get a gun."  Yet, you think some idiotic wall will keep out illegal immigrants when most of the immigrants are non-violent and most of the drugs come in through legal ports of entry, ships, and airplanes.  I mean...you're just plain dumb.,I just do NOT understand they level of insanity in people that think this is not necessary
How can you not associate mass shootings in this country to easy access to firearms?,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
*too,Build that wall . Then build more of that wall . We just can't get to much wall .
Poorly educated tRumper.,Build that wall . Then build more of that wall . We just can't get to much wall .

Trump morons...,No trust me the majority of us we feel for those Angel moms and one was too many this walls going up

They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp!

Janet Williams that's what I said too and the senate. There the ones stopping this, it's not the rest of us. Get the prisoners to help build the wall, like the frigid people,why don't you shut congress down and not pay them-then I would think they would come and build your wall
Sorry about that?,why don't you shut congress down and not pay them-then I would think they would come and build your wall
Suppose to be drug people,why don't you shut congress down and not pay them-then I would think they would come and build your wall
Danny Jones Thank you for caring.  God bless.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
But our citizens have consequences.   They get deported, only to come back and do it again,Ok now we get it, but there's people here who are born in this country and commit crimes too not just  illegal immigrants.   I feel bad for those who lost love ones to senseless acts of violence.
Americans face consequences,  illegals do not.  They get deported only to run right back.  And....how many children are trafficked across that border every year?,More people are killed by American citizens than immigrants,the wall is pointless
Because that has worked so far?  They do nothing! Let's declare some more sanctuary cities!  Oh, and forget about the children trafficked through that border each year,20% of illegal immigration comes in through Mexico, and a wall won't stop half of that.  Logical legislation is need, not a stupid wall.
Seriously?  They already are profiled.  Look at the Kavanaugh mess, the metoo movement.,LOOK!  A NON IMMIGRANT YOUNG GUY!  When do we start Profiling them???  JUST ACCEPT IT!   You and your followers are despicable RACISTS.Sacked man shoots five dead at US firmbbc.com
And they have consequences.  They do get deported so they can come right back and do it again.  Maybe if we took care of Americans and focused on mental health, we could save some lives.  There's an idiot idea,The KKK kills people everyday.   Where's the wall
Renieri Ortiz , and that is proof that we need to defend our country.  Look what our ancestors did to the Indians,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.
Sofiane Hamouda I got stitches when an illegal immigrant attacked me.  I'd report.  They can come in the right way,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.
What else is there?  They talk about security.  Obama did.  Other Democrats do.  But the sanctuary cities and stupid laws for their protection just make things worse.  They are all talk.  A wall will work.  It wont keep everyone out, of course. But it will keep many out.  And until they show other REAL ideas, I want a wall.  I have been jumped by illegals.  I was very lucky.  Protect AMERICANS, not illegals,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
I am sorry for your loss, but that American can face the charges, instead of being protected by sanctuary cities or deported,  only to come right back.,A American kill my  Mother
It wont ever matter.  They will all keep making excuses.,No trust me the majority of us we feel for those Angel moms and one was too many this walls going up
Americans face consequences.  Illegals get deported and come right back. And....what about all the children that get trafficked through that border?  Oh I forgot, our country no longer cares about children,Five dead in Illinois by gun violence. Far more deaths each year by gun violence and drug abuse. But sure.... let‚Äôs pretend a wall will solve it all.
Lynn Limauro Floyd So sad! God bless you! Illegal's need to be vetted! Build that WALL!,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
We didn't cancel when Obama was (small p for ) President. He led the way for not being one,Gods, you trumptards falling for this three-hankie story.  You idiots need to live in N. Korea. They have a very, very, very, secure southern border!  With its own dictator, you'll be truly happy there!

Dems are responsible at this point.  Their hate for Trump is so deep, they're willing to open our borders and let anyone and everyone in.,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage
Natalie Halem, is that all you've got?!  Nice try libturd.,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage
Vinnie Paul no it isn't moronic. If you are so against a wall, then take in 3 families of illegal immigrants, provide fiid, shelter, healthcare, etc and be held responsible for any crimes they commit.,Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets.

Paul Baker pretty common knowledge that illegals rarely have a driver's license and insurance.,An illegal alien driving a loaded simi ass-ended a line of cars stopped at a road repair who were waiting on the pilot car to get through. The older couple in the last car in line was smashed into a pickup. The pickup smashed into the back of a loaded cattle trailer and was deflected into the ditch. The older couples car was then smashed flat between the oncoming simi and the stopped simi and were killed instantly. The truck driver was an illegal and was burned in the crash. He was taken into custody and transported to OKC for treatment. There was never any news of what was done with him but I imagine he was released and hauled ass for Mexico leaving Americans with the medical bills and funeral expenses.

Linda Leitner Martin you do realize uh that we all technically are immigrants and that there is much crime found within our nation by itself... stop looking for a scapegoat.,Stay Strong against those who will destroy our country!
Greg Merz  won't you come find out what I am.,Greg Merz  won't you come find out what I am.
Ruben Radar Rodriguez thank you for your sacrifice,  we support you and your family.  Thank you from louisiana!!!!,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Democrats are especially good at twisting words... it's what they do.,Declares a national emergency, also states it isn‚Äôt an emergency, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need to do this, but I‚Äôd rather do it much faster.‚Äù  And goes to Mar-largo  I‚Äôm confused.   What is the emergency?  And how is your administration responding to it? By golfing?
That's why with the wall comes tech and other strategies, but it starts with a wall.  Ex...my house has a fence, door, locks, alarm system, guns.  It starts with a fence.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Nobody‚Äôs against the wall their against trump getting credit for it,i just don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt support the wall. we have walls everywhere. we‚Äôve been using them to keep INTRUDERS out for damn near forever. do you not use walls to keep your home safe? do you not lock your door to keep intruders from entering ILLEGALLY?? why is this such a hard concept for y‚Äôall to grasp? it makes perfect sense. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

https://www.gofundme.com/TheTrumpWall,This situation needs to be controlled. Unfortunately previous Presidents & congress did nothing. We do not have an Ellis Island to process large quantities at one time. Our current detention center on southern border cannot handle. We have 12+ million illegals already living here illegally. Majority are on assistance of some type. We have 700,000 waiting for vetting in court system, which is not equipped for that amount either. Fix the systems. Put up the wall until the illegals here are dealt with. When do you stop the runaway train? Before it kills people or after?

Too bad Putin is a really the one in control,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
I think you would need alchemy or something for that not a wall,I bet every Angel Mom would go without a paycheck in exchange for having their child back!
Deb Shriver, How did those illegals guilty of those crimes get into the United States?  We're waiting,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Gary Hooper, you have no facts to counter my comments so you resort to name calling.  It's classic for your type!,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
In a sense, the wall merely represents the Trump administration‚Äôs worst instincts and desires. It is harmful, wasteful, and offensive, but an ineffective wall is nonetheless better than the surge of 5,000 new Border Patrol agents and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to round up and deport people that the president also wants. No wall has ever arrested, robbed, battered, or murdered nonviolent people, as immigration enforcement has. A wall will not create an interest group to lobby for itself, endorse nationalist presidential candidates, and demand more power and funding, as the Border Patrol union does. The wall is more than a symbol. It will harm the lives of thousands of border residents and immigrants while wasting billions of tax dollars. But in a world run by nationalists, the one small source of comfort for non-nationalists over the next four years may be the knowledge that it could be worse.  -  D.  Bier - Cato Institute,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Larry Fields, they are not all criminals just as all Americans are not criminals.  Not allowing those entrance who are seeking refuge or a better life is criminal!  Goodbye!,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Laurel Balinski, there is nothing   illegal about them  if they haven't entered the United States!  Can't refer to them as illegal immigrants.   It's your comment that's wrong!  Why is YOUR FB PAGE FAKE?,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.

Tim Somolitis, the Republicans are divided about the need but either way, a person who listens to a proven compulsive liar who can neither negotiate or make a deal and wasted 6 billion dollars of taxpayer money shutting the Gov down over money for a Wall that he said Mexico said they would pay for, is in no position to suggest who others should  listen to üòÇüòÇ  Bottomline, it's clear that the politicians will deal with this in court.  The first of many lawsuits have already been filed about what they call a " Manufactured Crisis" in order to bypass Congress,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
You people need to believe the experts and not lying Trump.    A Border Wall isn't the answer. Most illegal immigrants overstayed their VISAS or entered through legal points of entry.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Pay attention please.    Experts have reported that  "The Wall "  will not keep out illegals.  Therefore, the 8 billion dollars that Trump wants for a wall  will be in addition to the amount paid out for Medicare, Medicaid and food since the Wall will not be effective.    Most illegals overstay VISAs or they come in through legal points of entry.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.

In February 2009, Congress approved Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus package. It cut taxes, extended unemployment benefits, and funded public works projects.  The recession ended in July 2009 when GDP growth turned positive.  In just seven months, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act pumped $241.9 billion into the economy. That increased growth to a robust 3.9 percent rate by early 2010. By March 30, 2011, almost all ($633.5 billion) of the funds were spent.   2. Modernized the Auto Industry Obama bailed out the U.S. auto industry on March 30, 2009. The federal government took over General Motors and Chrysler, saving three million jobs. It forced the companies to become more fuel efficient and therefore more globally competitive.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Victoria Deobald, Trump needs to explain why he didn't have Hillary arrested as he promised.  Instead, those who he surrounded himself with have been arrested jailed & sentenced.  This is the most corrupt White House in history!    75 INDICTMENTS,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Brought us out of a recession.  That's why he was elected again,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....

Beverly Hurst Smith BINGO. He and the GOP didn‚Äôt do anything because the didn‚Äôt want the fallout. All of this crisis stuff and shutdown stuff is for Trumps base. It could have already been funded and in progress by now.

Brenda Flores he did not say that,I can not believe Beto said he would abolish the Constitution today! He said no one follows it anyway! If that is NOT a verbal acknowledgement that the Democrats are trying to eleminate our laws.. Which is TYRANNY!  That verbal statement shows that we are fighting a domestic enemy! These people slipped through our system that failed to prosicute these people for their self confession of taking out the constitution! Why arent you people holding those accountable for stating this is their agenda..  And they sit in as a member of congress who are allowed to make laws and change them.. And no one is doing anything about it? Why? We demand answers!

Cindy Cripps-Prawak it seems that Trump is the only one trying to open the government. He went from a wall to fence sections and offered everything that the Dems wanted.

Norene Boone the ACA was not a republican bill... gtfoh with that nonsense.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Robert you're smart.,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
Davita Levao Jesus would confront him like he did the Pharisees. Except the Pharisees didn‚Äôt actually teach hate and intolerance. So Jesus would have a field day with teaching the president,And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.             Thank you Jesus for Trump and Pence.

Terrorists aren‚Äôt coming through Mexico.  We do have people coming down from Canada, 95% by air or tunnels.   The wall at the Southern border makes little sense except to make it difficult for vehicles.  I live in NYC.  People climb 80 story buildings here so a 10 or 20 ft concrete wall would stop nothing.  Also right now more Americans are moving to Mexico than coming here.

Ruben Radar Rodriguez worried more about a wall than healthcare?,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
All the men that dont support the wall or the president sit down to pee. All the women who dont support him are hung like male orangutans. Thanks Obama for your roles reversing gender crisis,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Cindy Cripps-Prawak   What's mean spirited is the fact that democrats care more about the illegals than they do the voters that elected them.  Why do Democrats support and defend illegal immigration, even declaring "sanctuary cities and States", and also resist voter ID?  How does supporting illegal immigration and fraudulent voting benefit the average US citizen? Any citizen?  How could anyone vote for any Democrat and think themselves a patriot?,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Mike Donovan if thoughts and prayers keep the children safe it should keep the border safe to,How about safety in schools‚Äîoh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Kay Mike White LIBERAL males you mean, no but more people are murdered by illegals than white kids, and teh illegals can be dealt with only this way, I dont think there is a cure for liberalism sorry.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Lisa Vocelka No you libtard you need to build that wall and evivt the illegals, Bad the magic Kenyan done that as he promised this guy would noy have lost his daughter to an illegal scumbag.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home.

Attention All Democrats: Trump IS still your President. COMRADES! üòÑüòÜü§£,You‚Äôve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
Dave Callender You‚Äôre an idiot. Of course Americans kill others in accidents. The point is that if these uneducated, illegals never came here those deaths they caused never would‚Äôve happened. If the wall saves just one life it‚Äôs worth it.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
I don't pay much attention to Numbers.....I talk to People and Look at the way people are Living.....,Hey Dude.....Rebuild America's Middle Class......You're The Smartest Man that's Ever Lived......You Can Do It......!! You're a Big Boy.....!!!
He could have had his budget approved under the republicans.  This is just a tactic by him to entice fear into people,Didn‚Äôt you have 2 years to do this when republicans held all levels of government ?
Sacramento Mendoza,Ok now we get it, but there's people here who are born in this country and commit crimes too not just  illegal immigrants.   I feel bad for those who lost love ones to senseless acts of violence.

Technology would do more, for less, but a scalable, tunnelable wall is the best thing his simple mind could come up with.,democrats know they need the wall they have said it in the past many time about border security BUT they don't want to give into trump. If it saves one life, just 1 life, then it was worth it
Kelly Belden While I find your inability to provide any defense of Dumb Donald at all hilarious, your inability to do it without bringing up a party I didn‚Äôt vote for either makes laughing at you even more fun!

Presley Mark That‚Äôs because the average person who comes over the wall using a ladder has more to offer America than you, the supporter of a democrat who wants to build a socialized wall using eminent domain, stealing property from Americans to build a wall that will stop virtually zero illegal immigrants or drugs.

Latoryaira Schnell Peoples Also, something like 80% of the girls taking the journey from Central America to the US are raped along the way. Who knows how many died along the way.

Latoryaira Schnell Peoples If you want to keep bury your head in the sand, sure. Here's just one study in Arizona:  "This data do not rely on self-reporting by criminals. Undocumented immigrants are at least 142% more likely to be convicted of a crime than other Arizonans. They also tend to commit more serious crimes and serve 10.5% longer sentences, more likely to be classified as dangerous, and 45% more likely to be gang members than U.S. citizens."  https://crimeresearch.org/2018/01/impact-illegal-aliens-crime-rates/,I notice everyone who says a wall is useless, senseless or stupid has walls in their homes.

As we know, there are already numerous tunnels under portions of our existing walls.  And there will be more.  Should we build motes around the walls?  I'm all for border patrols, drones, technology as well as sending more personal to the border to expedite the deportation process if the illegals don't qualify for asylum.  A wall would bring a false send of security.,As we know, there are already numerous tunnels under portions of our existing walls.  And there will be more.  Should we build motes around the walls?

Jordan Miller I think there is still outrage but personally I dont see or hear about as many Russians or Ukrainians walking or driving across the desert to illegally gain entry into our sovereign nation. We cant just have wide open deserts without any type of boundary. Its been open for years and our citizens have been having to deal with people illegally crossing borders, no Social Security number, not paying taxes, never go back to court to secure legal status and then get involved in crimes of which the wordt of course is murder whether its from drinking and driving or from gang violence. Either way, at some point we have to have a stopping point. Trump may not be a polished politician but he is the only POTUS so far who has had the balls to secure our borders,Wendi DelValle if a white guy would‚Äôve done the same thing, would you be wanting to banish white dudes from the country?

Trump works for FREE for Americans he can only fix things obama destroyed so fast,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?

Well sorry people, like him or not President Trump has been working for me, and you, and finally putting America first since he took office.  The economy is good, unemployed the lowest its even been, the military is getting stronger, and Trump is working to get all of the unfair deals and so on that the US has been getting screwed over on.  Yes there is alot of other things that need attention..prescription prices...veterans..elderly...homeless people, revamping the welfare system...but I think Trump has done a good job so far and glad he doesn't mind ruffling some feathers doing what he has to do to get things done..
Kimberly Mansfield  yep by crazy people that have mental health issues!! If their parents lost control what the hell can President Trump do? Most murders are from illegal guns the wall will cut down on that too! People with guns need to lock them up better! Not a lot can be done about crazy people!!,This is sad but shouldn't be America's main focus there was ANOTHER mass shooting yesterday done by an American! Many people killed many hurt!
Meren Tinu  let them i do believe President Trump is pulling out of there! Let China or Russia pay for them now I mean their own people are starving but hey I think it‚Äôs time America worried about America,American arms and armed forces kills families in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and probably Venezuela and Iran too. So all those mentioned countries will allied either China or Russia to protect their beloved families.
Nora Arevalo  he has and did address that also keep up,Mr President have you heard of Tunnels.
Pam Tigert  well said! The media will feel the bite it‚Äôs called karma!!! Ask the Grammy, and award shows they are at a record low Americans are making them pay simply by not watching I find it very amusing,We need more posts like this.  News only reports about not wanting the wall. Never about the American people wanting it. That's why trump was voted in.  I am sure if it was one of those loud mouth reporters on television that lost a loved one they would be singing a different tune.   Or the Democrats in office.  I was a Democrat,switched over to Republican when trump was  running.
Paul Packer  yep mentally ill! Problem is they are hard to find!

Sam North  mental heath issues! Can‚Äôt force crazy people to get help so what is it you think can be done?  That company had the obligation to protect its employees that is NOT the governments job!! We have security at my company with a locked fence only a badge can get you in and cameras right there if face don‚Äôt match you don‚Äôt get in and when someone is fired we are all notified!!! Companies need to step up,A legal citizen shot and killed 5 Americans yesterday.
Rose Mary O  nope they generally end up dead which is nice but if not the get life not one of the last 20 shootings did any of them get to plead insanity they either got life with no parole or were dead at the scene,A legal citizen shot and killed 5 Americans yesterday.
Valerie Siggson  yep because Trump can‚Äôt be bought!!,The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that
Wendi DelValle  so sorry for your loss! The people‚Äôs president has your back he WILL build the wall!!,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
...Cheryl Ostrow ...Please Do Not Breed...,Right now we need security at our airports where we are actually stopping thousands on our terror list. Agents aren‚Äôt being paid.  You sir are a fraud.   Do us a favor and crawl back into your reality tv hole    You make a piss poor human.

That's a fact. You can always have your opinion,This is way too sad. Americans need to fight for America and it's people not everyone else 1st
yes Ricky Wallace. We all want immigrants, but we want them to come in property and go through the proper channels. There‚Äôs a reason immigrants sneak into America illegally. It‚Äôs because they are criminals or they only want to abuse our Federal Welfare program. Legitimate immigrants will go through the proper process and become very welcome American citizens.,Eric Wroblewski thank you

Tricia Ann Bakley-Kralik  if they could just photoshop his spelling...,We have more mass shootings than all other countries combined and you do nothing, but three people were killed by illegal immigrants last year and it‚Äôs a national emergency?
Dave Boyer  can‚Äôt, just like his Muslim ban,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Judy Conrad  the cartels are a multi billion dollars even trillion dollar industry ... why because Americans feed off their drugs ..... it‚Äôs a drug epidemic here. If we ask for drugs they will supply. Going beyond that they have submarine, airplanes , hundreds of tunnels already in place, boats, drones, catapults... you think a wall is going to stop them from making trillions of dollars. Ha!,Duh! We all want border security but a dumb wall is not the answer .
Anthony Lococo exactly. Do whatever it takes to get that thing built! The dirty libs would!,Enough talking about it. R u going to get it done or what?
Tommy Carpenter yea Tommy I know. I was what you might call being sarcastic,This is not ok. If President Obama has said this, it would be Ok.....but not you President Trump. Nothing is Ok if it come out of your mouth. The media and the liberal socialist in this country I‚Äôll make sure of itz
Bob Long republicans cant read anything that long.  Well written thoughüëç,Heidi Dudek you are delusional you need to chk facts you are literally talking outa your asss !! Show me sources that state such bullshit !! Do you even know who blocked women‚Äôs Equal rights amendment to our constitution? Republican conservatives! Dont be mislead by stupidity! Trump n his campaign managers and chosen cabinet members are literally either in prison or on their way to it for criminal activity on behalf of your cult leader !! Omg the stupidity on this feed ffs ! History has shown economy has always done better under dems national debt has been decreased by more dems !  Trump has increased it !  And just a fyi im not a dem ive been registered republican for yrs ! but after them backing this moronic  idiot in the house now ! Never again !
James McCaskill because the idiots that cause most crime statistically are already here. Mexicans can get through my fence as I gave them a key so they can rake my leaves and clean the pool.,Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets. But if you listen to mainstream media or the Democrats nothing wrong with our borders.
Victoria Hall Davids YES! INFRASTRUCTURE. It is crumbling all around us.  Roads suck. Bridges are badly in need of repairs and we want to waste money. Go visit Buffalo.  Half the roads feel like they were bombed.,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Get your dumb ass down to the border and look for yourself...idiot,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
I live in Brownsville, TX., front lines. We had a steel slat high fence built here in our area seems like 7-8 years ago now. Only problem I see that‚Äôs not being addressed, is that along the border here where the Rio Grande River the apparently we have EPA regulations blocking anything being built within a certain distance from the river... So in many cases the fence is several miles inland on the U.S. side, dividing private land and surface streets. There are gaps in the fence in these areas so people can drive through and access that part of Brownsville. Seems like it would do more good if we fixed the EPA regulation and built a gap-less fence on the border instead of hindering access to privately owned land. I used to drive patients to their appointments and frequently pass through the fence unchecked in a 13 passenger van.,Those who oppose a wall are obviously hoping to support illegal activities. Search your soul. The cost is a non-issue and pennies in the dollar compared to the outrageous waste of our government.
Robert Dahlquist in some cases it can be much more. My previous job was a medical biller for a pediatric rehab where they offered speech, physical and occupation therapy. We had many patients that lived in Mexico come across every day to receive treatment that was covered by Medicaid. Basically it seems parents are having kids on this side of the border with no intention of living here, only to qualify their children for benefits. We billed over 40k a week. This particular clinic is closed now due to budget cuts, but this is going on all over.,Those who oppose a wall are obviously hoping to support illegal activities. Search your soul. The cost is a non-issue and pennies in the dollar compared to the outrageous waste of our government.
Ask why Melanoma was flying around during the shutdown, too. Oh, you don't actually care.,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Sue Morton ok, Wisconsin,Borders are fine.
Christy Grubbs I guess not,so if walls dont work do inmates in prison stay voluntarily??
anyone?????,so if walls dont work do inmates in prison stay voluntarily??
Britney Joray you talk about his daughter and your so stupid you cant read,Donald Trump you will get the wall and a lot more.  And of course, Pelosi and Schumer will take credit for it.  Obama will say he orchestrated it back when he was just a freshman chimp.  But who cares, you're getting the wall.
Steve Hopson of course they did,Donald Trump you will get the wall and a lot more.  And of course, Pelosi and Schumer will take credit for it.  Obama will say he orchestrated it back when he was just a freshman chimp.  But who cares, you're getting the wall.
Bet you didn't feel that way when Obama shut down the government to get what only he wanted, Obamacare (more money for himself in the long run). Trump is trying to get something over half the American people had voted him in for.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Stephen Pierson, the majority of Americans voted Trump in for the Wall. Or did you forget that, or are you counting the millions of illegals as part of your "Americans",Agree need wall, but don't keep punishing the working class to get it.  If shutdown keeps going, the next thing we'll face is a major Recession.   No money to pay bills, let alone buy anything or even go out to eat.  Use your executive order and end the shutdown
Cindy Sak Nowak obviously your comprehensive skills are based on Fictional world's where the same cops that you idiots are calling oppressors and murderers all of a sudden become your protectors when law abiding citizens have no guns. Get a clue,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.
Cindy Sak Nowak so you believe that when the government has shootouts with people that refuse to give up their rights because the illegal firearms owners aren't going to obey the law then everything gets better. You are to damn dumb. You say Chicago laws aren't strict enough yet open carry cities are some of he safest in the country.,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.
Democrats care about the flag (keep it holy) guns (keep'em close by) God (use his name often) and acquiring money by any means. Oh yea I meant republicans,The wicked Democrats don't care about the victims of illegal immigration. They care about power.
Andrew Whitaker he's fighting the Dems man.,I'm truly sick of hearing about it. Live up to your word...üòé
Sarah, that's because you have the most basic idea of life wrong.  You say on your FB page that you believe in the basic goodness of people. You are young and havent got a grip on reality yet.  All leftists look at the world this way.  People are not all good.  Unfortunately many are evil.  That's why we need conservatives to do the work of protecting.  Your effeminate leftist men can't protect anything while wearing a dress.  Don't worry tho.  You've got men down here in the US protecting that chunk of ice you call Canada.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...
I can‚Äôt believe Carl Ostenderp is still peddling his leftist lunatic tripe.  LOL.  SO funny.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...
Tony Perez, your next crisis is trying to figure how to get over that wall.  LOL,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...
Jo Sechi , Still don‚Äôt want  Illegals here period. And don‚Äôt want more gun controls. You have to realize that good Americans don‚Äôt commit gun crimes. And according to the department of Justice more deaths are committed by hammers than rifles in the US, so pick your poison and believe what you want. Gun laws infringe on the 2nd Amendment. And ban Shaiah law Nationwide too.,Very sorry and ashamed that this happened. This shouid never happen to an American Citizen. Our Congress especially the Democrats are betraying Americans. Muslims should not be in America or holding any kind of Offices either . Many Red flags from Congress going off that American Citizens must be aware of and have strong awareness that betrayal is happening Big time. We need to fully support President Trump, because Congress is against us.
James Ellis gun control ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,I'm sure a wall would have prevented all the school shootings that happened last year
Amanda Marioni Hunt same as using drones or other security methods for border security. You have to apprehend the illegal immigrants. Common sense says catching them as the come through gates is much easier than mass groups coming over open land or insufficient fencing. Like wise apprehending a boat is easier than swimmers.,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Mention one mass shooting or school shooting by an immigrant?  The problem here is trump that is dividing USA with his hate on immigrants,When an immigrant kill 1 person white citizens have already killed 10, I guess whites never wanna lose,  always on the lead on everything specially when it means killing innocents.  Facts from history
Really? Do I need to remind you of Hittler and the millions massacred?,When an immigrant kill 1 person white citizens have already killed 10, I guess whites never wanna lose,  always on the lead on everything specially when it means killing innocents.  Facts from history

...lol...if ANYBODY wanted to stop the cheap labor coming over the border & working in America, they'd punish some businessmen...but NOBODY in Business or government really wants to stop the China-cheap workers coming over the border.  Get real...wake up!  Business love American peons and workers are supporting their workers while they've lowered their taxes, letting average Americans subsidize their workers!  They're laughing all the way to the bank. Trump hires undocumented and contract foreign laborers brought over by some slimy company...you're ridiculous and naive...,No other country has open borders why should we

Gary Kane seriously Gary, if you believe this you are then part of the problem. It‚Äôs time to pull your head out of the sand and see it for what it really is build the wall.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Gary Kane because you want open borders you can have all the illegal aliens at your home and you can provide for them if you don't see a problem with open borders you are part of the problem!!!!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Norene Boone you mean Barry when you are talking about THE BIGGEST TRAITOR!!!,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

We need to start shooting,you mean a wall?
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin he‚Äôs better than all the other manure we‚Äôve had in the last 20 years or so. And he‚Äôs doing it for free. So what the hell do you do.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Schumer and Pelosi don‚Äôt care about us. They need to be removed from offices.,Two more caravans on the way . Someone is funding them and need to be prosecuted. Millions estimated to arrive on open field this year according to Spanish media last year.
lol Chicago is my hometown. Although they have some of the strictest gun laws, they're not strict enough. Another problem is that so many of the guns come here illegally from Indiana.,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.
Chuck Brantley  You're the one lowering your standards by attacking and calling names. It's apparent that's all you got. Most adults would be embarrassed to act in such a childlike manner. Same with Lyle, maybe you'll mature enough some day to hold an adult conversation.,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.
No Chuck I didn't say that. Brush up on your comprehensive skills so you don't look so foolish. Maybe your lack of comprehensive skills are causing your confusion.,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.
However stats have proven over and over again that citizens commit way more crimes than illegals. I would think many of the illegals that do come here also get their guns here since it's so easy to do so. However I am against illegal immigration but the majority of our mass shootings are caused by white American citizens. President Obama deported more illegals than any other president. It's not the crisis that Trump's conning his base to believe. Stats show immigration from the southern border is the lowest in 50 years. Many of the suspected terrorist that have entered this country, came through Canada. Trump is conning his base lmao,If the illegal doesn‚Äôt get into this country, neither does his gun he carrys
Brian Nixon do your research...the country blows that amount taking care of others, not the hard working taxpaying citizens of the USA.,We‚Äôll gladly defend them. But we won‚Äôt pay $21 billion just to build the damn thing, plus billions per year in maintenance.   The answer is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.  Your popularity is dropping pretty quick. You might want to go ahead and accept defeat on this one. That‚Äôs what you get for trying to tack regulatory bills onto spending bills.  ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. - Nancy Pelosi
Yes. There are a lot of hateful trolls.  I‚Äôd personally go build that wall especially if it would save lives,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!

Jim Butkowsky I guess you won't be saying that if it was your family,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.

He has failed to do everything he promised he would so far.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

If he is such a joke then why do so many countries want to make a deal with him?  The joke is on the Democratic Party. This is the first time in a long time our country looks and feels strong. The weak spots in our country are in the Democratic Party.  They care more about their political party than they do this country. We are all seeing clearly each and every day. Schumer, Pelosi and Warren will hand the election to President Trump because they hate him so bad they get nothing done.  Voters are watching them and laughing. Like Warren drinking a beer is going to get the Southern vote... That was pretty lame.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...

Arev Neerg... Just the opposite. Trump is far from acting like a child !! The real children are Pelosi and Schumer, refusing to do the adult thing and negotiate a deal. They don't want to budge. Pelosi saying she would only give a dollar? They can't see past their bitterness and hatred to put something on the table. This is not Trump acting like a child, it's the left using the wall against Trump and holding Americans hostage with their refusal to work with our President because it would enterfere with their political agenda,  shame on them!!,President Trump, ask the Democrats Pelosi, Schumer, Clinton, Obama if they would be OK with illegals/migrants climbing over their walls and entering their houses illegally, if they would be OK with it?
Pelosi slurs and can't even talk right. So what diagnosis do you give her?,President Trump, ask the Democrats Pelosi, Schumer, Clinton, Obama if they would be OK with illegals/migrants climbing over their walls and entering their houses illegally, if they would be OK with it?

Bill couldn‚Äôt agree more I told myself I would never have more kids then what I could take care of so I only had 1.,This Mexican lady also had 7 kids.  Not sure if they were all hers.  But.  We only had 2 because that‚Äôs all we could afford.  They want to flood the world with takers.  Not good
You heard her Omar,But Nancy doesn't care about our country!
Elizabeth it‚Äôs true she‚Äôs from California and she does care more about illegals then citizens.,I agree with you, terry, the rich people only out for, themselves
Chiang isn‚Äôt that what the extra tax we‚Äôre paying is suppose to go to.,Before you build the wall, can you finish the I-5 Interstate here in Los Angeles first? A measly 10 mile expansion is being worked on for about 10 years.
Well we know Donald Trump is our President not Nancy Pelosi.,What are you waiting for? Who's running this country? You have the power to protect this country, without the approval of the Democrats. DECLARE AN EMERGENCY! GET THE JOB DONE!
California is bad also we have so many illegals and they are getting all kinds of benefits that Americans don‚Äôt,Praise God, don‚Äôt stop, don‚Äôt give in to protecting our citizens President Trump!!

Lenny so true,Haha most who supports the wall seem to be in late 50-60s with no actual understanding of how it works.
Ask California we have about 5 million that we take care of. We are in debt to and the stupid governor wants more.,How much does it cost tax payers for just one year to support the illegals we have now?
Maybe we should stop the money we give them every year.,Why is Mexico helping the migrants?  Why doesn‚Äôt  Mexico put up a wall at there most southern boarder?   This is an invasion !
We already have a we the people petition and have raised over 20 million and it‚Äôs going strong.,If the government wont help you build this wall plenty of hardworking American people will if you make a go fund me account and share it on Facebook I know plenty of people who would donate... just saying.
What about when Obama went on a apologizing campaign in the other countries? Look America doesn‚Äôt need anyone to apologize for the United States.,Heil Donald J. Trump!  i have never been so embarrassed for my country than now.  Drop the hatred and quit hiding behind a symbolic wall.
Lena I agree with you 100%,We true Americans are behind you 1000%, Mr. President!
Mike this President has done so much for this country, I stand with him no matter what.,U bend on wall u loose votes mine included
Patricia why? Nobody ever wanted to do that with Bill Clinton.,Lets meet with the  17 AMERICAN women ADULTEROUS 45 sexually molested!
Is this the same poll that said Hillary Clinton would be our next president that no way could Donald Trump wIn.,Serious, Real News: My Client Resigned From the White House. It's Time for Trump to Think About His Children and Do the Same  Impeachment should be far from the President's only concern By Martin London (VP Spiro T Agnew‚Äôs attorney, back in the day)  The BuzzFeed report that former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has told investigators that, after the election, President Trump instructed him to lie to Congress has raised new calls for impeachment. But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen‚Äôs testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions ‚Äúinternal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents‚Äù) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family ‚Äî specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. ‚Äî knew the details of Cohen‚Äôs secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as ‚Äúdeep involvement‚Äù in the discussions with Russia ‚Äî a subject they‚Äôve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had ‚Äúextensive discussions‚Äù with the family members. The outlet‚Äôs two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them ‚Äúvery detailed updates.‚Äù If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump‚Äôs firm support in the Senate ‚Äî which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House ‚Äî dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President‚Äôs immediate concern is Mueller. This is not like Trump firing of then‚ÄìFBI Director James Comey, which lawyers can challenge because it was technically within the President‚Äôs constitutional power to do so for any reason, good or bad. This is conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony. There can be no argument that the President has the Constitutional authority to conspire to, say, cause somebody to rob a bank ‚Äî or commit any other felony, such as giving perjurious testimony concerning the President‚Äôs conduct.  Don‚Äôt forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex‚Äìcampaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President‚Äôs power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer ‚Äî and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?  At some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment. The longer the President waits, the more evidence piles up, and the tougher it will be to get a deal. Mueller already has a federal grand jury hearing evidence that just received a six-month extension. The President should make his deal before that body completes its work. The Mueller report may accompany a clutch of Mueller indictments.
Can‚Äôt put them at Nancy‚Äôs place she has a wall and security guards.,Nancy is a old hag witch who is trying to look good all she is doing is getting uglier by the day. Not talking looks here talking attitude.
Ray  Love it,I cant read. Im a Hillbilly Country Redneck. Rebellion is my Blood. LIBERTY or DEATH
Rob that is what‚Äôs going on here, California is in bad shape but a lot of people are blind to it. What we have is 5 million illegals and lazy people on welfare.,I found this post from a California resident giving his version of what's happening in CA.. "It doesn't matter what color we vote, The Dems have rigged the elections in California.. An illegal gets a driver's license and is automatically registered to vote.. He then gives his absentee ballot to a ballot Harvester Who votes blue and turns in the ballot..Voter ID is not required in CA.."
That‚Äôs funny when rival gang members came into my back yard and had a shot out with the gang next door I had a wall put up and guess what no one has gotten back on to my property.,Well if they want to they can dig under it like boarder patrol has pictures of. Or they can over stay a vacation visa to your back yard BBQ.
Todd everyone is entitled to their own opinion.,Victoria A. Deobald how you know this
Lenny couldn‚Äôt agree more.,Cut the Senator‚Äôs and Congessmen‚Äôs pay during the shutdown and things will start to work your way
Arnold Ringer and you are off in the head.and stupid,This isn't Trump's shut down, it's Putin's shut down.  Trump is doing Putin's bidding by crippling our society by its foundation.  Can't you see that Trump is tearing us apart by the seams, he divides us, propelling our young to animalistic hate.  Does this make you feel good?

Hey Dave, I believe that might be the stupidest response I have ever seen on immigration. Thank you, now you may STFU...,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
And you are living in the stolen land, hey maybe you should start a new movement in the country, and help give it back, by leaving!!!,NO ONE IS ILLEGAL ON STOLEN LAND! üëåüëå
How about, we regulate who is buying the firearm!!?? Makes more sense to me. Regulating the firearms, isn't going to solve the problem. Look at the UK, they took and regulated those guns, so evil is jumping into vehicles and running over people in mass numbers, folks are being stabbed with knives. Yeah, regulating firearms worked for them didnt it,A madman killed 50+ people at a concert in Las Vegas ‚Äî we must regulate firearms.  Or do we only use anecdote to make policy when it suits you ...

I don't feed into propaganda I have seen first hand. Walls do work they are built all the time for the purpose of stopping things.  if the wall is in place then we can focus towards what comes in through ports without the worry of it crossing over the border unprotected.

None of those are good arguments however our underprotected border is a good argument and for all the reasons you just listed along with many others.

I don't think he thought about the fall out that his shutdown would cause. It's not just 800,000 Federal Workers, but it extends to those that these workers owe money to. Local businesses are losing money because residents are not spending. This is very far reaching and is affecting millions. And then there are people who are rationing their medications because they can't afford to get more while they're not getting a pay check. And I would imagine that once the government does open it's going to take a bit of time to start to generate that load of paychecks for distribution.  trump creates messes and then offers to fix them. And his base can not see the obvious!,Stop holding  800,000 innocent Americans and their Families Hostage. Reopen the Goverment.
Chris Carr All federal employees keep their insurance during a shut down so your comment is irrelevant. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fedweek.com/issue-briefs/opm-issues-status-update-on-benefits-during-shutdown/amp/,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Joseph Nowik So read the constitution. Impeding the second amendment is a big no no. We've already made allowances. Now they should fund the laws in place.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Joseph Nowik There is big difference between building a wall on our border and trying to revoke our rights. If you cannot see that you're a moron.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Jason Morgan I agreeüößüößüî®üî®,Build that wall!!!
Michelle Hagler true but let‚Äôs make it deeper and wider then and add sharks lol but in all seriousness people need to come together and figure this crap out!!!,Instead of a wall why can‚Äôt we build a canal stretching from Texas to California instead? Just a different idea idk!ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Utterly stupid comment Beverly. Proof you‚Äôre a leftist moron.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Statistically, you are more likely to be killed by an American than an illegal immigrant. That's a fact.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Ange Richmond ... No... The percentage of crime by immigrants is lower compared to percentage of Americans.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Keith Dorn , Thanks I had no idea what it meant. Again thanks,Curtis Rudisail not sure whether you really don't know or you are trying to be a smart ellic. I will accept it as the first one. It is someone who has a family member, most often child killed by an illegal immigrant. Most of the time it is not the first time the illegal immigrant has committed crimes before besides being here illegally.
Cathy Collins Huhn Yes we do!,Thank God for a true American President!  We stand behind you no matter what!  BUILD THE WALL! TRUMP 2020!

Bobby Wilson: Looks like having a government job is not so luxurious after all and has its drawbacks.  Government jobs are the #1 biggest expense this country has and is the very reason our country is in such a deficit.  Converting us from a 'Republic For Which It Stands", to a never ending bloating Democracy Big Government has proven to be a disaster of which I am saddened to see that your just beginning to experience.  Our Founding Forefathers gave us a Republic not a Democracy!  They warned us, "If You Can Keep It".,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
In the Illuminati Secret Order Of Society Satanic Worshiping Group Contract, it says Congress is the almighty powerful that they are so powerful, they will take every penny then can from the tax payers and vote themselves a raise for doing it.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
Derrick J Johnston: You obviously do not live in Upstate NYS.  We rarely get sunshine in the Winter Months.  The only place the sun always shines is in Cuomo's pockets that he lines more and more of our tax dollars, with no end in sight.,I came here for the comments. (Was not disappointed) I find it halarious that everyone needs a voice on social media instead of a hobby in real life... maybe everyone should go outside for a bit...  The government has been shut down for how long? And the sun still goes up and down every day. Something to think on there
Kathleen Scott: Now you see just what has happened since we were reverted from a Republic (small less restrictive form of government) to a Democracy (large restrictive more expensive form of government that chisels away at or freedoms), which was not the original intentions of our Founding Forefathers.  Our Founding Forefathers gave us a republic and warned us, "If We Can Keep It".,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Easy to maintain the Hill Of Corruption once they have gotten their feet in the door and dig deep roots.  Term Limits would possibly help, but not the total solution either.  All Secret ORDER OF SOCIETIES, should be banned from our government.  They have no place here.  Just as JFK had stated in his last speech, and then he was assassinated.  He knew full well the dangers of having "100% of the Senate and 90+% of Congress Illuminati Members", for the Illuminati Secret Order Of Society Satanic Worshiping Group is a very threat to our freedom and God Like Way Of Life.  They are the root of evil and corruption and must be drained from the SWAMP entirely.,Willard Swanke i want a wall built deep and tall.
People live from paycheck to paycheck thanks to people like Cuomo that insists he is taking everyone's savings accounts year by year.  I just can not understand why people insist they keep voting him in to get re-elected to do that.  Stupidity has to be put in our foods, or broadcast as subliminal messages in the frequencies filling the air.,I agree we need to have secure borders but get the government open so people get paid. Granted people should plan with emergency money put aside but the reality is people spend what they make.
Sarah Knutson: But it is alright in your eyes that your leader of Canada has allowed so many Terrorist affiliated and dangerous people into your country with open arms.  A government that has stripped you of your rights to bear arms in your homes to protect yourselves.  Thankfully here in the USA, we still have our 2nd Amendment Rights to bear arms.  Tune up your own country before you try to tune up ours.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...
Gary Kane dude are you high?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Buck Strunk no one wants that. But a lot of other countries have universal health care, so by your logic, we should too,No other country has open borders why should we
For what?,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!

Lynn Limauro Floyd A white guy drove drunk and killed my uncle. We need to deport white people too!,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL

Lisa, the wall may not be a perfect solution, but it will take considerable effort to go over it or under it. There are areas of the border that allow anyone just to walk in. No resistance whatsoever.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it.

Brent Robinson keep up the great work. Your posts have been spot on and lay out the right positions we need. As for the false data offered from the Washington Post, that paper might as well say Communism on Display with Fat Liars across the front page. That paper is not worthy of the litter box.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
The Washington Post is the most left wing nut job paper in the country and the supposed data they have conjured up is not based in fact. Sorry for those who point to the Post as a source. Please grasp the truth of this. Any crime by an illegal is way way to many. To make it worse is the idea you would defend the idea that illegals have some right to murder American and get a pass from the rest of us. You are some kind of nut job all by yourself.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises.

What they poll 100 people. Texas is only one of 48 other states affected by this. Texas is now the voice of all America. What is Texas trying to be California and New York. I love when I hear about polls cause nobody asked me. Fake news!,You socialist communists prove how stupid half of America is

Cindy Cripps-Prawak I think you meant to say Pelosi/Schumer instead of President Trump. What you mentioned is exactly what they're doing. The dems don't care thing one about us. We are beyond disposable to them. The more of us who have our lives taken by illegals the more of those same illegals can come here. Its a win/win for them. Sadly Cindy...people like you won't get it until one of your loved ones is murdered by an illegal. No doubt if the dems get their way you won't have long to wait for that to happen.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Frankie Pazo  Yes. As long as they come in legally. Not storming the border!!,No other country has open borders why should we
I bet all them study's where by lying Democrats,Hope Lester Weston You really think those four CBP agent Trump put in front of a microphone speak for the entire CBP? They don‚Äôt.
Amber Maki did you complain when Obama shut the government down? The president has been trying to work with the democrats and has been met with opposition from day 1. It takes two sides to work together. What you‚Äôre really saying is bend over. Their priority is only to obstruct anything and everything the president proposes. Their goal is solely his failure and to hell with America. They‚Äôve been crying impeachment for two years since Hillary lost. You‚Äôve got Congress ‚Äúwomen‚Äù blabbering about going to Washington to fight Trump and impeaching the MF. REALLY? Their ‚Äújob‚Äù is to represent the people and they are using it instead to fulfill their own personal twisted agenda. Now you tell me how that is WORKING TOGETHER!!!!,During your campaign you said you were a negotiator and would work with both parties. In case you are unaware, negotiating is all about give and take. However, it is becoming clear that you are not able to work well with others and are nothing more than another politician dividing the country by political affiliation. Enough is enough with this government shut down! You are acting like a two year old who didn‚Äôt get his way. Meanwhile, there are American families who are wondering how they going to pay their bills and feed their children. Unfortunatlely, not all of us a rich like you Mr. Trump!
Carolyn Davis  you need to check your facts. Drug trafficking is a national crisis. Human trafficking. Is real. The illegals entering our country are costing us billions of dollars annually. 1.2 billion alone just to house the illegals currently in our PENAL system. This is not including the impact to healthcare and the cost to feed and house them in our population.,I hate labels but if we have to have them then I guess I‚Äôm a democrat. So let me tell you my answer to your question Mr Trump. You asked, so try listening. I would love for you to fulfill your promises!!! I keep trying to see good in what you‚Äôre doing. I want to be a fan of yours! But you never promised that we would pay for this wall. I don‚Äôt like the idea to begin with for a million reasons but I certainly don‚Äôt see our country funding it! We didn‚Äôt sign up for that. Your promise was that you‚Äôd build a wall and Mexico would pay for it. So do that. What‚Äôs more important to me? Working together to find a more reasonable solution which I‚Äôm sure is somewhere in the middle. Let‚Äôs take that money and apply it to actual crises. Border control let‚Äôs be honest is not a crisis.
Stefan Edlund AMERICA is important to our President. This isn‚Äôt about campaign promises. This is about national security.,No dear. Trust me. Our president don‚Äôt give a damn about America or its security. He ONLY cares about himself and his businesses.
Marie Smith this is the most sincere democrat post I have read. Thank you.,I am not a Trump fan. I am Democrat üíØ and will be voting that way in 2020. If someone can show me some data showing the walls effectiveness and that the 5.6/7 billion he is requesting will achieve that effectiveness I will support the wall. I do not want Trump to fail. I don‚Äôt care who is in office. I want our president to succeed and make this country better. I do not support open borders as a lot of Republicans have said. I am very aware that we cannot take everyone in and still be able to take care of ourselves. I know we need to have a limit. I do care about America despite what Republicans think. If Trump has a lasting positive impact for this country then I will be glad he represented America. It is very sad to see this country so divided. Democrats are just as much involved in this shut down as Republicans. Neither side is willing to compromise. I hope a compromise can come soon so Trump can prove me wrong and maybe change my mind in not voting for him in 2020.
Kory Sutherland you‚Äôre rude. But hey, I‚Äôm sure all the illegals you want to let in speak and write with perfect diction and punctuation in English. Right? No? Hmm.,Tim Gilbert . No crying here. Im satisfied with the results.

Illegal crossing on the southern border has been on the decline in the past 10 years, and a majority of illegal immigration is people over staying their visas. But yup believe the emotional driven propaganda all you want.,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.

Amen!,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Timothy Coleman you are an idiot,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.

Dean A. Groetzinger humpty dumpty trump is the "greatest negotiator". That was a lie too, right?,But you also said Mexico would pay for the wall not the US citizens and not spuriously through savings from the replacement for NAFTA.
Jason Terruso simple concept:  open govt, then get TAX PAYER $ (not Mexican cash like he said!) to build wall $. What a great negotiator! Fake!,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.

Suiter Kaye makes sense right?,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that‚Äôs where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don‚Äôt see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That‚Äôs unacceptable.  Anyway, I‚Äôm done discussing it.  If üá∑üá∫ doesn‚Äôt interfere,  üòâ I‚Äôm sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.

Kimberly Overen a wall doesn‚Äôt fix anything. Chapo used tunnels, most cartels use planes. Immigration is actually going down over the years.

Carole Conaway wrong,Your promises, Mr. President,  do not make things better for Americans....only worse.  We have people lining up at food banks so their families get a decent meal, people have no money for gas for their cars, you have no idea how wrong you have been against our citizens....the pain and suffering they are experiencing is YOUR FAULT and not the Democrats. Own up to it and stop your vindictive behavior to all of us.  Your poor little rich guy attitude is disgusting and will be your downfall eventually, at the voting booth.

But what they should do is actually look through the comments and look at the likes and see what it really shows. It shows that trump will enjoy another 4 years because they are vastly outnumbered. And the reason they should look at that and accept the reality coming their way is so they can just do the world a favor now and remove themselves from it immediately.
So we should put in an ideot like killery in there right u r as dumb as they come don't like it here leave I will pack for u I no ur too stupid to pack ur own bags,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off.

Brent Robinson. What high approval rating? He only has high approval among racists and idiots. Out here in the real world he's at about 30%.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
JM McCormack. Were you born this stupid or is it a residual effect of being a trumpanzee?   Democrats aren't nearly as stupid as Trump's base. We know how bad of a deal that is.   Your "leader" is trapped in a situation he created. Enjoy.,If the democrats do not take the offer over DACA they are going to lose another large portion of their voting base...
Sharon Samuels. Really? Hate crime is up 75% since Trump took office. His followers have shot up newspapers, churches, concerts and synagogues. They've been caught planning terrorist acts and some have actually bombed a Mosque or two. There was the inept MAGABOMBER endangering the lives of postal workers, secret service and elected officials. There was and still are nazis freely walking the streets and terrorizing innocent Americans not to mention the nazis in Charlottesville that killed an American. But, your leader called them fine people.   Maybe if you keep to Nazi rallies and klan meetings, you'll feel safer.,Mary Hillgrove thank you.    have a good day
Sharon Samuels. You're not safe because of Trump. Ironic, isn't it?,Mary Hillgrove thank you.    have a good day
Great Britain.  Enough said.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

John Tanksley better yet give me your address ill stop by you don't have a fence do you ? Or a gun. I have some friends that can swing by and chat as well ok deary,Well, well, well...remember the 2010 Southwest Border Security Bill that obama signed?...                                                                            "The President signed into law a comprehensive plan to secure the Southwest border, including $600 million in supplemental funds for enhanced border protection and law enforcement activities, offset by cancelling $100 million from the SBInet program within DHS. Though not specifically provided in this bill, the President has also authorized the deployment of up to an additional, requirements-based 1,200 National Guard troops to the border, a deployment that has already begun."    I guess the Dims just sat on their thumbs and did nothing once again to secure our safety.
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin so you realize almost every President before him has said the same thing. You realize there is wall and fence started all over down there right. You know that right. Barrack Clinton all of them have said this. He must be great he made all that appear out of thin air I guess... Wow but I'm the brainwashed one.

Norene Boone He didn‚Äôt really have a majority. He didn‚Äôt have all the Republicans either. It takes 60 % in the Senate to pass bills. He is fighting a group in Congress who want and like the way things are. They don‚Äôt want change like some people want. They want power and money. Even term limits may not stop it and most if not all of them would never vote for term limits. Call it what you want, but we have a stalemate. And we are getting nothing of value to us and or the country.  The only things we have gotten in the last two years came from Executive Order. I for one do not want a dictatorship where one person rules. I like what we should have and I think it‚Äôs worth fighting for.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Elizabeth Burton Steere thoughts and prayers never was intended to be the solution. Thoughts and prayers are how people cope with tragedy. President Trump has proposed a wide range of security measures for our nation schools, but it's up to the individual School District to implement those measures including building walls around the campus.,Build the Kate Steinle memorial wall "NOW!"
Ashley Archer it works at other schools. They have to go through security checkpoints. Israel has never had a school shooting and they implement the same security measures that we want here.,Build the Kate Steinle memorial wall "NOW!"

Correct. So why wouldn't we slow down the invaders. You want to immigrate here do it the legal way. Real simple.,sorry to say the wall will slow them down but not stop them.

Ruben Radar Rodriguez, thank you for your support. May God bless you and your family.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

More Americans pessimistic about Trump's presidency than any presidency in last 25 years  His strongly disapprove rating in the Marist poll, at 45% this week, tied his previous all-time high for that pollster. By the Quinnipiac University poll's reading, his strongly disapprove rating stands at 50%. These are very high strong disapproval ratings. Trump is as strongly disliked now as President Richard Nixon was when he resigned in 1974.  CNN,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
Trump‚Äôs Slippage in Support is Real  The slippage is the worst kind‚Äîthe slow erosion of support from key blocs: swing voters (independents and suburbanites) and those who put Trump over the top (blue collar white men and Republicans over 60).  It‚Äôs been registering in a cross section of polling data, not just one poll. Trump‚Äôs job approval rating is down to 31 percent among independents in Gallup. His approval ratings in Rasmussen are down from the 48-49 percent range of late last year to the 43-44 percent level of the past week or so. The Marist data for PBS shows a drop of 10 percent in job approval among Republicans and a decline of 11 percent among white evangelicals and 17% among suburban men.  And Trump continues to enrage the Dem base while this erosion in his base continues to progress. Blue collar white men being turned off from Trump shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone, for they know the difficulty of living paycheck to paycheck. This, plus the skew of the tax cut package, spells political trouble for Trump long term, especially if a slow down, much less a recession, looms in 2020.  Bulwark,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.

Trump Organization‚Äôs Use of Foreign-Worker Visas Reaches 10-Year High: TPM  Despite President Trump‚Äôs anti-immigration rhetoric, it appears that the Trump Organization has been using foreign workers at a higher rate than ever before, Talking Points Memo reports. The organization requested and received at least 192 visas for foreign workers in 2018‚Äîthe highest for the company going back to at least 2008, according to Department of Labor data. The Trump Organization received an average of 116 visas per year in the decade prior to 2018, according to American Bridge, a Democratic research group. Review of the data revealed that the visas were almost entirely for the type of low-skilled foreign workers that Trump has claimed drive down American wages. Cooks, servers, housekeepers, and farmworkers make up a large chunk of the Trump Organization‚Äôs requests, most of them making between $10 and $15 hourly. The largest number of the Trump Organization‚Äôs foreign-worker visas in 2018 went to his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Florida. Last year, the resort received 78 temporary foreign-worker visas last year for waiters, cooks, and maids.  DailyBeast,Amen! Thank you for all you do.  Hang in there. We are counting on you.
Rudy Giuliani says Trump didn't collude with Russia but can't say if campaign aides did  (CNN) Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday that he never denied President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign, only that the President himself was not involved in collusion.  In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on "Cuomo Prime Time," Giuliani, a former New York mayor and Trump's attorney, said he doesn't know if other people in the campaign, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, were working with the Kremlin during the 2016 presidential race.  "I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign," Giuliani said.  He added, "I said the President of the United States.

Levi Col√≥n illeagal Mexicans should contribute 0% percent of the total crime in this Country. They should recieve 0% of this Countries budget.

While it might be difficult to see the big picture,the economic loss to this Country is staggering! Time for change.,"Borders" a.k.a the Mexican border.  Because there are so many Mexicans committing atrocious acts like mass shootings every other week *cough* that's all you white folks *cough*, illegal Mexicans don't even contribute to 1% of the total crime in the US, that 99% is done by Americans. Soooo why the need for a border wall??
Susan Casto He can't force Mexico to pay for it. Unfortunate,if he choose to stop the annual welfare this Country gives to Mexico,the liberals would melt down!

Sorry bro both are a joke.,Stricter gun laws will protect Americans walls will not help the crime problem
Look it up the judge said that because he came from a privaledged family he would not have to go to jail....for killing an ENTIRE family in a drunk driving incident. Im not gonna do ur research for u.,This is HORRIBLE that our President would share something like this. Smh from a drunk driving accident? Come on now...this is SO DIRTY! That white kid in TX that killed a whole family didnt even get any jail time because of his privilege. But u wanna use this as a platform for billions of dollars for a wall??? GTFOH!

Trump. Just because you were able to ask your parents for money or have the Saudi Government bail you out of your bankruptcies do most hardworking Americans have that luxury. They were not born with a silver spoon in their mouth....,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Janey Renteria you need to review the law. Commander in Chief means exactly that. He is responsible for protecting this country, not the House or the Senate. Children are wrongly being used by the migrants to gain entry into this country. Our laws are outdated, and this requires action to secure our borders.,What are you waiting for? Who's running this country? You have the power to protect this country, without the approval of the Democrats. DECLARE AN EMERGENCY! GET THE JOB DONE!
Steve Tash lmao, what an argument. Obama increased national deficit $10 trillion, more than every other president combined. And Russian spy? That will remain the most ignorant crap being spewed by democrats until Trump is done. When I have thousands extra back on tax returns, I don‚Äôt give a crap if CEOs are getting tax breaks. Newsflash by the way, when large companies get tax breaks they invest more in workers, create new products, open new facilities, etc. That‚Äôs good for Americans. Stop spouting crap from the left wing media.,Nancy and Chuck don‚Äôt care what the majority of their constituents want, they just want to keep you from succeeding!
When it is made an ultimatum to get votes for Pelosi, that‚Äôs a bit different.,Nancy and Chuck don‚Äôt care what the majority of their constituents want, they just want to keep you from succeeding!
You‚Äôre a bit out of touch with majority apparently. Hell, majority of democrats didn‚Äôt even want Nancy as Speaker! She had to agree to term limit as speaker for them to vote for her.,Nancy and Chuck don‚Äôt care what the majority of their constituents want, they just want to keep you from succeeding!

Arturo I appreciate and respect your opinion but please think about border patrol agents at that border with no protection against hundreds of people rushing to cross! It is impossible and dangerous to not have any barrier or protection for them. You NEED some sort of deterrent and protection for those on the job,Ppl ppl ppl ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don‚Äôt yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Lisa Palmer Fleming.   YOU WANT PESOS ???  AMERICA NEEDS TO QUIT PAYING AND GIVING A FREE RIDE TO EVERY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.  PERIOD !!!!   IT'S A SHAME AMERICAN CITIZENS INCLUDING ELDERLY, WOMEN, CHILDREN & VETERANS ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS OR TURNED DOWN FOR SERVICES, BUT A ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT GETS A FREE RIDE AND EVERYTHING ON OUR TAX DOLLARS.    IF THEY CAN'T DO IT LEGALLY THEY DON'T DESERVE TO BE HERE.  SO YES, STOP LETTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BLEED THE SYSTEM DRY AND THERE WILL BE MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THE WALL.   AND ANOTHER ANSWER.  WHY WAS OTHER COUNTRY'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM ???   RULES, REGULATIONS AND HAVE TO EARN THEIR OWN WAY.,Eddie Sturgis scared of the success .. your party better grasp what is happening to the heartland and entire running of our nation.
Deb Lilred Arrowood illegals verses what $$$ towards helping our own citizens first.  And the Democrats have the nerve to request more $$$ for foreign aid than what is already being allocated but no concern towards the safety and security of the citizens they took a oath to serve and protect.  Whatever,  some sheep keep their blinders on.,Tim Gilbert . No crying here. Im satisfied with the results.
Timothy Mueller.   Well when certain states let ANY ONE VOTE LEGALLY  OR ILLEGALLY AND DON'T REGULATE, CARE AND COVER IT UP WHAT DO YOU EXPECT !!!!   You are so "good" at math take a look at how much $$$ are spent on illegal,Tim Gilbert . No crying here. Im satisfied with the results.
There has been more than 1 illegal that is responsible for the death of innocent Americans.  And just yesterday there was a fentanyl bust that could be responsible for 4,000,000 deaths in this country.  Its a combination of problems, criminals, drugs, diseases, burden on our medical and educational systems.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Norene Boone Funny, the Dems don't play that way.  Remember Obamacare bill Pelosi said you have to pass a bill to see what's in it as they rammed another mandatory tax down our throats. That's how the Dems legislate! Bunch of corrupt crooks!,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Allyson Stuhlmiller Everyday I miss him, his face, his eyes he had the most amazing dark brown eyes. His voice telling me to calm down Dee. Only would he call.me mom when something serious happened. You are right half of me died the day he died and the other half wishes for him. He had his life planned out from the age of 6 years old.. he was like an old soul in a beautiful body. My heartbreak is sometimes too much....i miss his beautiful heart. He was very uniquely special...hes not here so every year that goes by is harder because I see his friends living out their lives and he is not here to do that. He was so full of love and life,I'm so sorry for the loss of your lovely daughter. We lost a daughter three and a half years ago. She was 25. I am so sorry for you.

John Wild there is no strategy with Congress.  They have play with peoples lives for years.  Trump is one president who they can't make  a puppet out off. Now I ask you what is your solution to border security?,No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.   STOP hurting our own citizens - it is IMMORAL.
The US has been a laughing stock Trump is trying to fix it.  He is the first President  that isn't a puppet to all the bureaucrats.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...

It will cost us American taxpayers way more money than this dang wall will cost to build!! Unbelievable!!,These Democrats are unbelievable!! They do not care about your safety!! I can hardly believe this BS they are telling and to belittle the president !! His main campaign was to secure our borders and we voted for him to do what he promised he said he would ... now the Dems want to say that , that is not what the American people want? WHAT?  Are you kidding me .... we would only want Legal immigrants to this country not ones who think they can just push and free load off us and expect us to change our laws.  Do you taxpayers want to pay for these illegals . The healthcare and housing , food etc that we would have to supply to them gives them handout that we Americans don‚Äôt even get!!  You either come her legally or stay out !!   BUILD THE WALL
Jeanie Railsback sorry about your husband but if he was an illegal he wouldn‚Äôt have to have insurance and his health care would be free in California!,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.

Dante Noel   A liberal loon not supporting this "POLICY!"

You know, the Court that caters to dictatorships and terrorist regimes, while degrading and finding fault with  democracies, especially Israel and the United States!!!  I'm sure you'd fit right in!!!!,America first! Trump 2020!
Chris Weiss   You Fool!!!!  You may know the skin color because that's the first thing LIBERALS notice! But you have no IDEA whether they were Christian or not!!! Of course, unless you're writing a book and have researched and talked to the families, friends, churches they've attended, basically gathering evidence, facts, quotes from family members, friends, pastors of the churches these White males attended in order to write a book dealing with the mass shootings that occurred in 2017!!!   I know you're not a writer! I know you haven't researched this claim you've made of their religious background!  So why don't you SHUT UP and quit using this asinine claim to bash CHRISTIANITY!!  We have enough of that going on in our country today!!!!!,Every mass shooting in 2017 was carried out by American born Christian males!
Dan Griffin   Neither do I!!!  It's facts versus feelings!!!!,You will notice on these threads that conservatives engage in logic based, constructive dialogue, while most of the emotion, and misinformation comes from the left? What does this say about the people being voted in by the dems? I just don't meet very many smart liberals out here in the real world

Dave Callender When it becomes illegal to be named "Ann" fine but it isn't. However, have you gone to our federal immigration site? It is ILLEGAL TO ENTER HERE WITHOUT GOING THRU THE IMMIGRANTION PROCESS. You liberals just like to pick and choose what laws you want people to obey. Plus you have no problem murdering unborn humans!,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Dave David Let's get rid of every brain dead liberal, starting with you!,Get rid of the white male gun toting Christians and we‚Äôll all be much safer.

Austin Wheeler I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.

Dave Sienknecht really, over 1100 came through an open area the other day.  That's one day.  Over 52,000 captured in December,  and those are the ones they caught.  Thousands more are in our country.  Illegal aliens come through open borders, and that is a fact.,The question is, would a wall have stopped this guy from coming here? No, because the vast majority come across ports of entry, not the desert.

Larry Martin our farmers love Trump!  I'm farm community here!,We support you and fully agree with you!!! Build that wall because Congress and the Democrats don't know how the rest of us live and go through.

While 3 people in my community were killed by natural born citizens. But I only care about what directly affects me. So let's focus on the immigrant".  Conservative logic behind the wall. ü§î
Kerry Gay this family spoke about needing a wall.  So, he isn't using anyone.  You're very ignorant.  The cities who have the strictest gun control has the highest gun violence.  Crime in your state is up to your state, this is a federal government problem of protecting its borders. Please, try researching before speaking, because you definitely are ignorant in many areas, and ignorance is unbecoming!,Following this logic, shouldn‚Äôt you be focusing on common sense gun laws, affordable healthcare for all including prescription medications,  the opioid crisis, and livable wages for all? The family you‚Äôre using to politicize this issue have suffered an unspeakable and horrific tragedy - just like all of the families in the mass shootings have along with all of the families that lost loved ones due to being priced out of medical treatment.
Krista Meyer they do put out warnings, at least in Ohio.  I post many of them in my crime group.,As we protect our country from people entering illegally,could we also raise the danger level of Mexico?   Our son was murdered there on vacation 3 months  ago.  The murder statistics are outrageous.   Statistics are higher each year.  There were 30,000 murders there in 2017 and 17,000 in US.  Mexico is 1/3 the size of US.   We need to investigate murders of our citizens in Mexico!
Laura Anglin Peterson  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.  You can't use national security crises on guns, because it's a protected right in the Constitution.   Obama used national emergency for Obamacare, and the courts said its unconstitutional.   Quit feeding your mind with liberal poison.,Yes, Protect all Americans!! 5 killed yesterday from US citizen. The national emergency is gun control and affordable healthcare!! Not wasting money on a wall, Years in the courts!!
Lisa Mann no, it will be difficult to go over, and it will have cement footers.  Since you will be able to see through it, border patrol will see digging or other things that could show other avenues around the wall.  The slats make it difficult to go through.  So, with other things that Trump asked for, like more agents and technology (which was in his package they denied, and then passed with 1.4 billion for a wall) the wall will slow down any potential illegals.  If by chance they could make it across, they will be apprehended immediately,  which doesn't happen now in areas without barriers.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Maureen Hersey Brown I can't believe the lack of compassion and empathy by these liberals.  They say, "who cares?!"  Wow!  And, the other lame garbage they put up is so mental.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Mike Mandel that was in his initial package that Nancy said no to.  Geeze, dont you people ever pay attention?,I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.

You really need moron meds,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

SO TRUE !,Sarah Knutson: But it is alright in your eyes that your leader of Canada has allowed so many Terrorist affiliated and dangerous people into your country with open arms.  A government that has stripped you of your rights to bear arms in your homes to protect yourselves.  Thankfully here in the USA, we still have our 2nd Amendment Rights to bear arms.  Tune up your own country before you try to tune up ours.
Come LEGALLY !!!,Mr.Trump u r ancisters are from Europe...u r ancisters  distroyed Red Indians  cammunity..U.S is country of Imigrates...
WHAT.... Ck GDP & Economy#'s.   How is that failing?,It's incredible to see someone fail so miserably...
dumbass,   you believe everything you're told obviously,Then maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have conspired with Putin.
LEGALLY !!!  Not all at once.,If we are a good nation we work with other nations and not shut them out
At least he cares about American citizens more than illegals !!!,Trump needs to resign. He is a disgrace to the office. He needs to stop with all the lies and be truthful to the American people.
i love USA & the President of our Country.   He did not to go through all of this crap you guys put him through bc he is wealthy yet he still does it, why ?   bc he loves our country !!!,Then u shold start telling the truth. Almost half this nation believe your lies and turning on the half of the nation. Was that your objective, to divide a nation? U certainly have done that!!!!!!!!!
dumb,What nation, Russia? You‚Äôre making Putin proud.
Norene Boone not true. But CNN will keep telling you it is.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Joseph Roy  it had to be Fox News üòÇ. Realistically tho are you stupid to the point where you believe rape will end in the us after all the illegals are gone? Will there still be innocent people getting shot by police, and more innocent people getting shot by crazy Caucasians? That walls not gonna solve all these issues in America, and I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôre stupid enough to believe something like that.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

Linda Silver Trumps IQ is quite high . What's yours!?,Trump this is total Bullshit! What a Propaganda post ! We will be a Nation and "STUPID Trump" isn't gonna fly in with his tights and cape to save the day ! Trump you are so PATHETIC! Trump,your first and only priority is to open up the Government NOW, so these people can get paid ! Trump, you think that by NOT paying the Border Patrol that there won't be the cartels to swoop in with butt loads of money to tempt these people! Wow, that sounds a might bit CRAZY! There had already been CORRUPTION on the Southern Border !Trump, you are complete imbecile,pay the Coast Guard ASAP, they keep our borders "SAFE" ! If this is Not some kinda of "SiCK " game and a Political ploy to "USE" your CRAZY base,then prove it ! OPEN UP THE GOVERNMENT! I still am interested in where all the 1.6 Billion Dollars that you got in March went ? Why are you asking for an additional 5.7 Billion dollars ? Why hold these Feberal workers "Hostages" just so you can say "I won " ? It should demonstrate to the American people that you don't "Care" about the citizens of this Nation and that you are a "Greedy ,INCOMPETENT,EGOTISTICAL,,LIAR "! Trump your tweet about Schumer is very PATHETIC,you Fired Comey because of the "Russia Thing"! What Trump are you grasping at straws? Trump ,you could go today and TESTIFY to Mueller Face to Face and put it all behind you ,since all of this is just more Distraction from the Meuller investigation! Dude,you still have the option to RESIGN before you are in PRISON! Why don't you just to that,save the country money and time in your IMPEACHMENT hearings !

Joani Pakula you should provide some data which demonstrates that there is a security crisis at our southern border. After you realize that the evidence doesn't support that crisis rhetoric,  you should think critically about the true nature of this demand for a wall (campaign gimmick) and the fact that there was bipartisan legislation passed by the Republican Congress that Trump refused to sign - after he said he would,  which shut down the government.    Is it rational to support and believe a well known liar?  Is it rational to blame Democrats for a shutdown that Trump promised if he didn't get what he wanted?,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.

Laws against drunk driving are already in place and are enforced.  Immigration laws have become relaxed and people try to protect those who come here illegally.  Big difference in how the 2 are addressed.  Did my friend deserve to die when he was walking down the sidewalk and was struck by a female illegal immigrant and thrown 50 feet through the air and spending the next 2 weeks in the hospital before he died. The driver was sober and had no insurance and because of her status as an illegal the state's DA decided not to press charges she lives a happy life in Rockford illinois while an American family weeps.  So how will you defend something like this.  Even more so when the person that killed my friend had no legal right to even be in the country that my friend fought and served for.,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it‚Äôs an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.

No it won't, if they're carting them in vehicles, they're coming in at a border point.  That would require more staff to check more vehicles.  If they are coming by sea, no wall will stop that,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Exactly,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Adam Smith yes, you sure as hell are not AMERICAN, STAY IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY WHEREVER THAT IS!,You‚Äôve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
it's the demo RATS fault at this that these people are not getting paid (but eventually will get paid), dems are stupid and ignorant, we need this wall, walls work, they work in all the other countries that WE actually paid for!  I know these demo RATS got ants in their pants, but they need to let go now and work w/ our president and get this wall up now.  no more pussy footing around here you dems, you need to wise up and see what you dems are doing to this country, you are all (demo RATS) destroying our country by letting illegals thru our border and eating up our money and OUR PEOPLE are the ones that are hurting and suffering, doesn't Pelosi know many of these illegals have killed our people?  what is wrong with her?  OH, yes, she has dementia or much more a mental problem and does not know what she is doing.  what would she do if an illegal killed one of her kids (if she has any) or grandchildren or a loved one?  I guess she would just ignore it, thats her.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
What does that have to do with the illegals who commit murder in our country? Do you actually see a similarity between the 2? WOW,President Trump should invite the Covington Catholic High School students to the White House.
Nick Nevels the "now" is that illegal immigrants are a problem that needs to be solved.  It's been brought up many times by many past presidents and then ignored.  This President promised to deal with the problem and is trying to do what he promised.  Elected Democrats are doing everything they can to oppose him at every turn.  They think if this lasts long enough that people who once supported Trump will get frustrated and won't support him in the next election.  Plain and simple.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Carl Ostendarp he did take responsibility for shutting it down.  But Democrats are responsible for keeping it down for this long.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Cindy Cripps-Prawak like Obama did during the shutdown during his presidency?,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Kelly Anders hopefully you realize that not all illegal immigrants are brown.  Also, what does being gay have to do with your fear of white men?  I probably don't understand the issues you face because #1 I'm straight and #2 a person's life choices, sexuality, political affiliation, skin color, etc aren't really things I think about when I meet someone or pass them on the street.  My first impression of people is usually based on whether they are polite and pleasant or have a chip on their shoulder and a crappy attitude.  Other than that, I personally don't go throughout my daily life in fear of much.  I do believe that illegal immigration is a problem in the United States.,As a gay woman I worry more about white men than brown men
Thanks you for your sacrifice,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Nancy Pelosi doesn't care. Keep the Shutdown in force Build the wall,Terry Clark what's Hillary got to do with anything. That shipped sailed long ago. You guys need a new tune....lol
Albert Kojo Kyekye agree,Eric Wroblewski thank you
And yet the haters and hecklers remain stupid assholes. üòî,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Dave Callender   Regardles of any crimes commitef by them after they get here,It is illegal  to sneak into the country,. When an american citizens break any laws we are held accountable.  They shouldn't be an exception. They  are criminals because they brpke  the law.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Emily Neal The only way to prevent the government from becoming  too powerful is our guns. TYRANNY. Protection,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
Maybe you are on drugs ,then make sense your comment.,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don‚Äôt want this wall.
Lenny Anders yes, and it was not even read by her or the others.humm. We see the hypocrisy here daily.,Pelosi has Alcoholic Dementia, she needs to go to rehab!!!! That's a start to securing our borders.
Drew Mullen , tell that to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who don‚Äôt care about anyone but themselves! Living in their mansions behind gates with bodyguards.

Don Cosner I would like to add today‚Äôs lesson: On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  ‚ÄúThere is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace...

Work on them and they'll do something about Nancy Pelosi.  Pelosi needs to be reminded of who it is she works for and that she is NOT the president....not even close.

Maybe a lesson to all who is interested in following the wealthy elite lifestyle? Its the ignorance of masses that's makes the 1 percent wealthy?
Kyle Sakamoto God had a wall build check it out it's in the bible ,keep reading you might learn more than that stupid.,Meanwhile, you clearly don't listen to the voice of thevmany faith leaders and loving Christians in the United Church of Christ, Methodists, Presbyterians, Mennonites, Quakers and others who speak out against the wall. Even some of the Amish who are informed of current events speak out against the wall. It is not Christian to build walls.
Christopher Brandon Voight then move to Mexico,I don‚Äôt want the wall!
Julia Woofter Rife call the democrats in DC and tell them it‚Äôs their fault!!,Agree need wall, but don't keep punishing the working class to get it.  If shutdown keeps going, the next thing we'll face is a major Recession.   No money to pay bills, let alone buy anything or even go out to eat.  Use your executive order and end the shutdown
Max Bassanini idiot!!,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
Norene Boone how did that work out for Obamacare the biggest fraud on the American people? You can keep your Dr. we have to pass it to read it Pelosi!!!! Democrats are despicable people!!!!are you one too?,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

ü§£üòÇü§£,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
James Novotny hate to break it to you there sparky, but it was Hillary and Obama who colluded with Russia and Iran, and it's looking more and more like agents of the UK as well to try to take down Trump. if you getting your news from CNN you got to know by now they're lying to you how much more proof do you need?,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.

Easy fix for all those in favor of making the term illegal immigration, sponsor a family into your homes no background check welcome them into your homes making it a legal immigration, so basically put your money where your mouthes are, with all the free stuff they get or drug money or human trafficking money they can pay you rent,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
Ottavio Esquivel if the wall is built Billions of tax dollars that are spent yearly will be on the decline, the ileagals get wealfare, bring in high amounts of drug dollars, work for cash and send your tax dollars in the Billions back to their country. In a big way Mexico would be paying for the wall in the way of spending less tax dollars on them,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
MJ  Stark, yes I do have a job! I have a job because of President Trump! Before all the deregulation I was unemployed for a little over a year! My last employer let 130 employees go and sent our jobs straight to Mexico. President Trump addresses everything most of us were concerned about. To top things off, my wife and I make more money than we ever have. Our standard of living has improved greatly and I am 57 years old!,Thank you President Trump! I admire you for holding your ground and keeping your promises.

Michael Pearson Lying Trump supporter?  I am a Proud Iowa Trump Supporter who, like Ruben, does not lie.  Mike Gruenfeld, your figures are far from the truth.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Thank you!,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period.

TROLL ALERT!!!,Where is his taxes.
Ron O'Hearn  Whipping is cheap and effective, you can even train animals with a whip.  It's actually the way I was trained to have respect for the rules.,I believe legislation would be way more effective than a wall.  If there were no benefits, no work, no way to even move around the country and commit crimes, and there was immediate punishment (whipping) and deportation, then we wouldn't have a problem with illegals wanting to be here in the first place.
Estefania Torres Restrepo Exactly!,You‚Äôre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Keith Vaz  Aw jealous because your not getting any!  Best President Ever! Vote Trump 2020! We the people back you 100%!,Course it is when there is no more pussy to grab.
Marley Dee  you keep telling yourself that! Trump is the best President Ever! Build that wall and secure our country! Vote Trump 2020! Do you realize Nancy is what‚Äôs wrong with our country! She wanted the wall once until Trump promised the people the wall! Now she doesn‚Äôt because she doesn‚Äôt want Trump to make good on this promise to build the Wall! Problem solved if Nancy was dismissed! She‚Äôs going to far! Government could open if she cared about the people! Hey Nancy open your doors and fence your friends are coming!

George Mendes  lol all you proved with that made up list , is that you know the months of the year in order! Lol Good for you! I have a gold star sticker for you!!,Eric Wroblewski thank you

Teresa Pagniano where did he get his first dose?,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.
Patrick Dixon they arent running here from Tijuana üòÇ,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
oh, it's there..Joan..the love for our president..from all the people who want to live in freedom...that is a vast majority of the citizens..!,Note your poll numbers are tanking and even suburban white men show an 18% drop in approval....You make all this love for you up so you feel OK about yourself....It isn‚Äôt working...
hope you are talking to Nancy, because she is the one keeping the gov't closed..she will not negotiate in any way...stays hidden or on vacation..the president is ready to listen to whatever she purposes...,Terry Clark what's Hillary got to do with anything. That shipped sailed long ago. You guys need a new tune....lol

Dave Mosley Jr. And he did at first but now at this point the continued shutdown is 100% because of Dems.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Roy Meston then every President in the last 40 years has been weak.  Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Obama all shut it down.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Mike Donovan remove them from being gun free zones & they will be much safer.,How about safety in schools‚Äîoh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Norene Boone except Obama shutdown the government until Obamacare was passed.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Vicki Zamow good was the best thank god,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Carolyn Alexander she thinks she‚Äôs better than everybody else,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
https://www.facebook.com/realCharlieKirk/videos/388989571873719/,Pelosi, Schumer and other Democrats #1 goal is to obstruct, indict and impeach President Trump at the cost of the American people, they do NOT care about us! Democrats in powerful positions only know how to lie, cheat, steal, obstruct, spread hate/violence, corrupt, cover for each other, make everything about race, attack religion, play on our emotions, and get away with all types of crimes on their way to getting what they want. They support open borders and abortion. They are NOT above the law even though they think they are untouchable. Progressives/Socialists/Communists ALL think the same, just at different levels of insanity.
Andrew Webster House has approved budgets, the Senate has the authority to approve the budget as well - they just won't without trump's "permission" (which is not how it works BTW) Trump is holding our citizen's pay hostage while you act like a butthurt child.,Say's the man who won't pay 800,000 of his government employees
Eddie Almeyda my act of kindness today is not to respond to your misunderstanding.,Thank you for speaking out. Prayers of peace for you and your family.

Dump. Ass,Democrats and Republicans have passed funding for border security. You want only your nonsensical campaign promise version. And today, you Tweet that you never meant for Mexico to literally pay for it? You are a very bad joke. Not laughing.

Cynthia Hill says a lot that you think not cheating on your spouse is "living on a pedestal",As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. ü§îüòÇüòÇ
Wow the lengths these people go. I'm legit sorry for your husbands,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. ü§îüòÇüòÇ
Cynthia Hill yes we can certainly cast the first stone.  We have never cheated on our spouses, so yea.  Maybe it's not the case with you so you find it surprising, but a lot of us live our lives with honesty. You're sounding very suspicious at this point though,  trying to normalize adulterous behavior and all,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. ü§îüòÇüòÇ
Let's see your husbands cheat on you,  then turn around and say "well you're not perfect either". Lol let's see how much sense that makes then,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. ü§îüòÇüòÇ
Lol these people:  "Cheating on your wife is bad and says a lot about your character" isn't a statement that requires a perfect person to acknowledge, just a *moral* person to acknowledge,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. ü§îüòÇüòÇ

Anne Miller GFY troll no friends on its fakebook page STFU troll,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down.

Sources?,The KKK kills people everyday.   Where's the wall
You're missing the point. Its called a deterent. It will make them have no choice but to use those methods and will likely be shot down or sunk if so.  Why do you have locks on your doors at home if someone can just ram a car through it or break in a window? Thats your logic,Nikki Graham How do you know this? Did you read the bill? Who is your source?
I can see why you arent a politician,By that logic, an illegal immigrant saved my life. We need to tear down any type of border.
Roberta Hayes apparently it works for Democrats.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Kevin Peevey that's not how any of this works üòÇüòÇüòÇ,The wall will fix drinking and driving?.........
Kevin Peevey üòÇ no... that won't stop natural US citizens from drinking and driving and causing fatal accidents... it's only a news story because he was an illegal immigrant... if it was a white guy it would have been a completely normal occurrence üòÑ,The wall will fix drinking and driving?.........
Amedeo Corey make it easier? My god you're an idiot,you mean a wall?
The overwhelming majority come in legally, overstaying visas, and through legal ports of entry other then Mexico.  A wall would prevent none of that - proper legislation, which lobbyists to both sides oppose, would.,20% of illegal immigration comes in through Mexico, and a wall won't stop half of that.  Logical legislation is need, not a stupid wall.

Many, one could say it's the addicts fault but I wouldn't. The facts are 90% of herion come across the southern border.,The Stable Genius was so correct when calling those who appose a wall liars. The Angel families must be heard, the 70,000 overdoses a year must be taken into account.  We must have a wall as part of Border security.

Anne Tourjee how about we don't give South America 10.6 billion in aid. How about you pay 70% of your pay. You don't penalize someone for success and reward others who don't have success.

GET OVER IT!
Are you so clueless that you are not aware Trump refused to accept the $400,000 presidential salary Obama got? His salary is $1 per year to comply with the Constitution.,Dear Mr. President, since you, the senate, and the house of representatives have chosen not to work with each other I suppose that none of you  been denied you salaries in regard to the shutdown...what a surprise.  Does that mean I don't owe taxes for the weeks or months that this shutdown is in effect?  Afterall if I'm not receiving services why should I pay for it?
Keep it shut Mr. President...the millions she talked about can get a real job in the private sector....surely they are not that incompetent that only government can offer them a job?,Just please reopen the government.

Sorry about your son üò•,My son was killed by a drunk driver also. That man was from Long Island New York. Should we put a wall there too? Odds are in the years both of us lost our kids to drunk drivers the majority of them were born & raised in the USA. Does one death matter less because of the who or where they were from?  Yes laws need to be enforced all the way around but especially on the employers that hire undocumented workers.Something so many neglect to mention or enforce. Seems even Trump branded businesses like to hire the undocumented.  Not sure a wall in the middle of the desert would make much of a difference. Ports of entry, towns, cities is different.  Everyone agrees something needs to be done just some of us see the wall as a waste of money from a man that promised Mexico would pay for it. Maybe use fines imposed on businesses that use undocumented labor illegally to pay for a wall where it would be most effective.

She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Sharon Et Trina Bratley  American drunk drivers get let off too !,I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
Where‚Äôs the data for this? I don‚Äôt believe your statement.   Let me tell you a story. Someone wants to shoot a big bunch of kids, so they walk into a gun shop, get an semi-automatic gun straight away and goes and shoots up a school. This is the problem.   The solution: the same person wants to shoot a big bunch of kids, they go into a gun shop, background checks are required and then a waiting period. Background check finds the person with multiple mental health/violence issues and are not allowed a gun. Person can not shoot up a school and overtime thousands of lives are saved.,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
Dave Tuttle he will not get his wall, he will get money for border security.

meanwhile, climate change, election security, record National debt, the opioid epidemic, North Korea, Russia, Iran, disappearing middle-class, crumbling infrastructure, healtcare costs, etc.  just aren't as important as this wall idea.  abFUCKINGsurd.,and, Americans DON'T want an expansive border wall.  but when the POTUS chooses his favorite approval poll (Rassmusen at the time) and lies about 1% point (49% approval NOT 50%) in order to convince people he's doing great, is it any wonder that we believe that ~4,000 terrorist aliens were apprehended at the southern border when the number was ACTUALLY 6?
next he'll suggest a northern border wall because 41 were apprehended there (more than 6).  and you guessed it, next it will be a giant dome encompassing the entire US.,and, Americans DON'T want an expansive border wall.  but when the POTUS chooses his favorite approval poll (Rassmusen at the time) and lies about 1% point (49% approval NOT 50%) in order to convince people he's doing great, is it any wonder that we believe that ~4,000 terrorist aliens were apprehended at the southern border when the number was ACTUALLY 6?

A wall will force those seeking refuge to come through a legal port of entry,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.

Ken Arrington same place every millionaire are moron.dont like it change the law,Where is his taxes.
Rob Novoa which rock have you been under??  Citing on a February 2017 CIS analysis that used methods of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) Camarota begins diving into the numbers ‚Äî and they are jarring. ‚Äú(Based on the 2017 analysis) we estimate that each crosser creates a net cost of $74,722 (taxes paid minus costs) during his or her lifetime, excluding costs for their U.S.-born children. The figures from the NAS study are in 2012 dollars; converting them to 2018 dollars would raise them to $82,191. This estimate means that for every 100,000 illegal immigrants prevented from crossing illegally, it would save taxpayers $8.2 billion over the illegal immigrants‚Äô lifetimes,‚Äù Camarota writes. That figure, $8.2 billion, seems a lot more costly than $5 billion. But surely, there can‚Äôt possible be 100,000 illegal immigrants crossing, right? ‚Äú(Border Patrol data) implies that the number of successful crossers in 2018 was between 173,731 and 203,476, which we round to 170,000 and 200,000 in this report for convenience,‚Äù Camarota adds. Based on those numbers, that $5 billion wall would only have to stop about 3 to 4 percent of illegal immigrants in the next decade to pay for itself.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Tony Connelly I agree with you. Between medical issues, underinsured/uninsured people not being able to afford medication and medial attention they need and gun violence due to untreated mental illness we have a real crisis.   If we want to stop most illegal immigration we just need to start putting the people who hire them in jail. it doesn't even have to be long, it could be as short as 30 days. however this would put a concrete consequences behind hiring an illegal.,Eric Helmes  Yes, put Trump in jail for knowingly hiring illegals first.   But it‚Äôs not even an issue. Historically illegal migration ebbs and flows according to economic need.  Right now it‚Äôs in deep decline and has been due to low unemployment.  This isn‚Äôt even in the top 100 issues we should be focusing on.   But, you know, campaign promises an all.
Yeah, good luck with that üòÇ,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Competition is key to competitive prices and work. When the people working don't care about their quality of work, they give out what they put into their work. Would you go to Walmart for all of your primary vehicle work to be done? Sure you will get a good job here and there but when you spend more at a different shop you will definitely have much better work done.,I'm tired of illegals taking jobs from Americans for absolutely dirt cheap pay... The electrical field is hard work but people like my self are willing to work them. But we are tired of fixing their horrible work and not just bad, but dangerous work, not meeting the proper city codes...
Oh I can yes. But if we're an illegal who starts his own business and hires other illegals.... Or if you are a home owner looking for cheap labor because your don't make the most money in the the world. Then you hire a guy of Mexican decent but he speaks good English. Only to find his "work" is shabby at best and that that man is not even legally here....,I'm tired of illegals taking jobs from Americans for absolutely dirt cheap pay...

Angel Roy walls are built to keep people/animals inside.,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
Matt Smith Did you know that almost ALL illegals get here via Airplane? Literally NONE get through the southern border.,Actual American here. WE DO NOT WANT THE WALL.   There‚Äôs thousands of things that 5 billion could be better spend on then a half ass wall.   Also, why are there so many Non-Americans saying ‚ÄúBest President Ever?‚Äù...... Trumps vocal fan base is a bunch of fake accounts. Trump‚Äôs cabinet is guilty.   Real Americans value human life. This isn‚Äôt Russia

Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall.

Michael Angell 5.7B isnt the whole cost of it, and Trump's methods of justifying (the ways he says it will get paid for) are ridiculous.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down.

Webster Lynn Vi I promise I will not spend a dime on it. I will personally see to that.  He promised he would have Mexico pay for it and you voted for him...you pay for it ! If you really think a wall will keep them out you are part of the problem. Mexicans are not carrying millions of drugs on their back.  They are coming in planes, car and boats. How is a freaking wall gonna stop that.  A waste of your MONEY,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
Your idiot president will not make 2020. People would rather vote for a dog than him....maybe you should do some research and you can see for yourself he is the  MOST HATED  PRESIDENT EVER! But I know that's not gonna happen because people like you only believe what they want and not FACTS.,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth,Sue Howie stay in New Zealand and stay out of American politics funny how foriegners want a say in our President fu
Joe Calabrese I've gone many months without pay. I have a lot of empathy for the victims of illegal immigrants. I also realize that our arguing here on Facebook won't change either of our minds, so don't bother.,Please open the government. My husband has been protecting the public from dangerous inmates and   is working for free. We have two children that we need to feed and provide shelter to! Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.

Of  Course we need a Wall ,We need to do everything possible to stop the Criminal element from coming into our country  ,  Right now it's very bad for our country.  Guns in the wrong hands will always be a  fact ...Are you saying Guns shouldn't, be allowed ? Americans need protection from Drugs , and , all the politicians making it a reality .. I see a Country  that is being controlled by  people like Soros , I see Our Great President Trump  trying his best to go forward with a Wall and ,security for Our America  to protect Our great Nation  .. Its time to  be proud of our country again. ( Taking  Guns from the honest man will not remove the  Guns  from the depraved  segment of society ),I feel so very hurt for you.  The Wall will lessen the chances of such  a criminal to be on our streets .. Words can not comfort  you with such pain in your heart. But a Wall will prevent this in the future ...
Jo Sechi We must have a Wall  and we Must Stop illegal immigrants from killing    Us ..,I feel so very hurt for you.  The Wall will lessen the chances of such  a criminal to be on our streets .. Words can not comfort  you with such pain in your heart. But a Wall will prevent this in the future ...

Mike Charles , another treason supporter.,So, parading victims‚Äô families? Looking for ratings, right?   An illegal made your bed thousands of times and you were fine with that bexause you and your ilk saved $$ in wages. So GTFOH with your parade, #hypocrite.
Lee Judy you don't like to hear you get out of United States,Liar, con man, Russian asset
Linda Mckenzie yeah see how fast it changes when it's one of their family members,I guess not enough people have died from heroin or from illegals for Schumer and Pelosi. You know President Trump you have a heart and it showed tonight. You love the American people.
If all is said and done and the political arguments are passed again and again, more fluently each time, like a complicated classic dance, the Potus has the ultimate responsibility for US security: "Buck stops here". That said, a compromise is always to be advocated if both parties want that. (some guarantees for "Dreamers" in exchange for funding the Wall. That wasn't perhaps a bad idea.Like in the Agent Starling/ Hannibal Lector scene: "Quid quo pro Doctor".),No other country has open borders why should we
cnn said that "Cohen was the President's lawyer". I have to look that up if that is strictly correct. Was Cohen the lawyer of the Potus when he took Office? The word "lawyer" also seems not really correct: Cohen was in fact more of a fixer. Nobody sees him as "a learned legal mind" at all.,No other country has open borders why should we
The "Nation State" cannot be taken lightly. Main worry for Brexit and the British Government is "the falling apart of the United Kingdom". We already heard lots of Brits politicians talking about "the Scottish Nation".. "The Welsh..the Irish.. do not accept this".,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Interesting you talk about research because you haven‚Äôt posted a link to any article. Can you post a link to the article you received these statistics?  Here is an LA Times article posted Last week saying that there isn‚Äôt a crisis at the border.   https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trump-speech-immigration-border-crisis-20190206-story.html  Also I‚Äôm not sure how the history of the country I was born in should have any say in who I am as a person? What if I judged you on the history of America? Last I checked, white people today should have no burden placed on them for the atrocities of slavery in America. Let me know since that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been reading.,You‚Äôre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
James Brubaker  Okay just did, here are all the articles that showed up about BORDER AGENTS in Texas and their views on Trump‚Äôs imaginary crisis.  You resorting to insults of me and my heritage display your complete inability to participate in any informed discussion and any further attempts on my part will clearly fall on your deaf ears. I just hope someone does a complete search of their views after seeing this information.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/1520651/border-patrol-agents-in-texas-showed-trump-why-his-wall-wont-work/amp/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/amp/Texas-border-communities-cringe-as-Trump-sounds-13518898.php  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chron.com/news/politics/amp/Texas-congressman-calls-Trump-border-remarks-13539330.php  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.haaretz.com/amp/world-news/border-agent-explains-to-trump-why-a-wall-won-t-solve-the-problem-1.6831070,You‚Äôre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Terri Reeves there is an enormous amount of scholarly literature on the analysis of REAL data received from border agents and agencies. There is an enormous amount of data available after decades of research, it‚Äôs all there you just have to look. These are based on STATISTICS and not opinion.,You‚Äôre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Austin Baker he‚Äôs using the death to push for his border wall which he INCLUDES in the headline.   EXCEPT a wall will do nothing for illegal immigration. They overstay their visas or come in with forged documents. The ACTUAL drugs and crime come through vehicles through legal ports of entry.   He‚Äôs not asking you to pay for immigration suppression but an entire waste of money that‚Äôs more symbolic of America than it is an effective tools,You‚Äôre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain

Mike Charles I‚Äôm the only one posting facts and figures collected by research organizations.  Please feel free to post the information you guys have backing up your understanding of illegal immigration.  Also I‚Äôm not sure how this has anything to do with Republicans or Democrats. This is about what is the most effective tool to deal with illegal immigration and understand the actual statistics put forth by those who study illegal immigration.,You‚Äôre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain

Jay Boogie Boogie Woogie Roogsky?????,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that‚Äôs where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don‚Äôt see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That‚Äôs unacceptable.  Anyway, I‚Äôm done discussing it.  If üá∑üá∫ doesn‚Äôt interfere,  üòâ I‚Äôm sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.

Roy Meston If you thought that then you have not been listening at all.."Our proposal is not intended to solve all of our immigration challenges. This plan solves the immediate crisis -- and it is a horrible crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis like we rarely see in our country. And it provides humanitarian relief, delivers real border security, and immediately reopens our federal government. If we are successful in this effort, then we can start the border [broader] project of remaking our immigration system for the 21st century. Once the government is open and we have made a down payment on border security, and immigration reform starts to happen, I plan to convene weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House so we can do a finished product, a great product -- a product that we can all be proud of, having to do with that elusive immigration problem."

Total BS. 40 years and politicians don't do a thing.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Beverly Hurst Smith you are either funny or stupid!  The Democrats in the Senate vowed to oppose and block anything this Administration puts forth and they had enough votes to do it!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Roy Meston because it causes a domino effect of wage increases, also, it puts many small businesses out of business, as they often don't have much of a profit margin, their only option is to lay off workers, or incorporate jobs, which would prevent them hiring in many cases, the economy would start to tank within a short time, federal employees would probably be the first to lose their jobs, budgets would not be able to cope with such an increase!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

the law of supply and demand.  wages are a price.  scarcity of workers affects the demand (price) / (WAGE)!!!!  this hurts minorities the most.  a lot of people are aware of this.  not only that but every year public sector gives itself raises but private sector is held down by mass immigration.  This is a problem even for Democrats because ultimately, even if you tax the private sector 100% you will not be able to fund the public sector.  As it is, there is talk of removing private property and every other scheme we conquered at the dawn of America and the forces driving these motives are caused by mass migration which drives down wages via the LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND!!!!  we are screwed if we don't fix this and it really is national security.

Listen, Santa....,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me.

Angela Wilson very well said.   I agree,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.

On top of the fact that I thought they were ‚Äústealing our jobs‚Äù,  or was that a lie?  You can‚Äôt have it both ways.  They cannot both be stealing our jobs and simultaneously refusing to work.  They do jobs that you or I would only do as a last-ditch effort to stave if homelessness at best.    They also DO pay taxes!  Just not federal income taxes.  They pay sales taxes on everything they buy.  Where‚Äôs the outrage over major employers choosing to knowingly employ these people anyway?  There is a creation of an attractive nuisanice in ignoring that kind of illegal employment.  But, again, why waste that kind of money on a wall that won‚Äôt stop drugs or gangs?  Especially when we are facing a record budget deficit.,This is the Netherlands and Belgium border.  I don‚Äôt see any wall, built during a time of record budget deficit.

Vicki Zamow like ........,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Costing us $3.2 Billion,What the Government should learn from this shutdown is that people ‚Äúdo not‚Äù have 6 months savings for an emergency!  That needs to be addressed!!
Ruben Radar Rodriguez, thank you for your sacrifice!,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

One is na√Øve to think that building an ineffective wall across our southern border will be a solution to a long festering problem.

Lillian Weisberg Conway: Sarah Sanders made 'unfortunate misstatement' about terror suspects at border  ÔøºBY BRETT SAMUELSTWEET SHARE EMAIL  White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday downplayed the Trump administration's misrepresentation of the number of suspected terrorists apprehended at the southern border, arguing press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made "an unfortunate misstatement" a day earlier. Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked Conway if the White House's inability to get its facts right on immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border hurts its credibility after Sanders said on "Fox News Sunday" that "nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border." Anchor Chris Wallace challenged Sanders on her comments, noting that the State Department had said there haven't been any terrorists found coming across the border and that most were captured at airports. Conway on Monday acknowledged that most of the nearly 4,000 terrorists apprehended in fiscal 2017 were found at airports, citing a report from the Department of Homeland Security.  "It got unfortunately conflated by a colleague," she said. Ingraham went on to criticize the media for "cherry-picking" statistics and argued that "we all kind of make mistakes." "That was an unfortunate misstatement and everybody makes mistakes, all of us," Conway said. "The fact is, it's corrected here and anybody who turns a blind eye to the actual numbers of human trafficking, the increase in the drugs, we are concerned about your children here in the United States not being subject to all these drugs and we're concerned about their children."  Trump administration officials, including the president and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, have in recent months stated that thousands of terrorists attempt to enter the country, but have generally not elaborated on where those individuals are apprehended. NBC News on Monday obtained data showing that, in the first half of 2018, Customs and Border Protection stopped a total of six immigrants at the southern border who are now in the terrorism database. President Trump is set to deliver a prime-time address on Tuesday discussing the situation at the border, which he has referred to a crisis. The president has pushed for more than $5 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border, which has precipitated a partial government shutdown that has lasted 18 days and counting.,Eric Wroblewski thank you

rising share of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade. About two-thirds (66%) of unauthorized immigrant adults in 2016 had been in the U.S. more than 10 years, compared with 41% in 2007. A declining share of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. for less than five years ‚Äì 18% of adults in 2016, compared with 30% in 2007. In 2016, unauthorized immigrant adults had lived in the U.S. for a median of 14.8 years, meaning that half had been in the country at least that long.

Curtis Rice Your stats are fake. We have the worst gangs from central America now because we are to free with our immigration polices.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Lisa Mann No all the surveillance won't be as effective. And no they won't find a way to get over or under with the right wall. Ex.. Isreal has a wall that is 99.9% effective. We need that.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Why not put the army at the bordee that money can be spend much better or wiser,What is justified doesnt need to be justified....

Tim Masters he didn‚Äôt veto it.  Yesterday you said it shouldn‚Äôt be an emergency order.  Now the government will spend millions more in court fights.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.
Tim Masters or the Dems could have approved barrier $ like they did for all previous presidents.  All politics.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.

Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.
Tim Masters right and Congress over the years handing power to the executive branch is the problem too.  They have to take back what they got lazy about and handed off.  Executive branch can now create laws and regulations all on their own in different departments,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?

Doug Reiselt Did I say it 'touched it'? Not exactly relevant is it. You surely can't be saying that the current expenditure is the absolute perfect maximum required.,Georgia Wass my career was in healthcare. $5.6B doesn‚Äôt touch what is invested in healthcare. You just like to hear yourself talk.

Diana Acosta ABSOLUTELY....THE WALL IS NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION....PEOPLE WILL ESCAPE INTO US WHEN THEY REALLY WANT TO,..SECURE BORDERS..,PERIOD!!!!,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don‚Äôt support it. Don‚Äôt say we.
Elizabeth Navarrete Ponte then you and the 22,7% of the voters that's left of the people who still want the wall can start emptying your piggy banks and pay for it yourselves So that means from the 135.7M voters just 30.8M people still want the wall... if you all collect 185 each then you can start building the wall... for now, but in the coming years you must pay that again because the wall is going to cost more than 50B + maintainance,Edward Odine well we‚Äôll
Empathy is not your greatest gift eh ? Just like Trump. Apparently you've got as many brain cells as you've got pesos.,Trump is a POOR negotiator.  He tweets responses to tv host Ann Coulter over her criticism of him. He‚Äôs terrified of her .  Trump is a WIMP.   Trump works for Ann Coulter.  Not the American people.  Trump chooses to use the financial hardship of 800,000 Federal workers as PAWNS.   It‚Äôs like negotiating with a gun to their heads.
Victoria A. Deobald help us do what?,We want security, but no new wall
You can call it whatever you want. We need  border security.  The left does not care about it citizens they only want power. They can give money toward this as they waste billions on other things that is good for them,President Trump: Please end the government shutdown.  I'm for better border security but does it have to be a Wall?
William Bush Trump Train üöÇ 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Logan Jeffers What ‚Äúempty‚Äù campaign promise? Trump is trying to fulfill a very important campaign promise, probably THE most important promise of his campaign, but the Dems are trying to thwart his efforts. Why? Not because they don‚Äôt believe in it, but because he is Trump. Period!,Mike Hine there was bipartisan support to open the government, and Donald denied it because it wasn't the right number for him. You know my views about Donald more than probably anyone else Mike.

Shawn Caulder they are both the same thing in principle. the government functions like the rules of a household on a bigger scale. people who live in a home are governed by those rules, and walls of a home are meant to allow authorized people to enter just as the walls of a country are meant to only allow authorized people to enter. its interesting how you do not seem to be able to internalize such an easily understood idea,do people live in houses without walls? lol, nope. so, why should the collective home of every american not have them?
yes there should be a southern and northern border by 2030,do people live in houses without walls? lol, nope. so, why should the collective home of every american not have them?

Stewart Schaniel guns are not being taken away just laws to make sure they are in the right hands. Because remember guns do not kill people but people kill people. We need mental health checks, and training and awareness. These are the laws that need to be in place. It is called common sense gun laws.,So do guns but the government is slowly taking them away.
It should all be a concern.,38 er cent approval rating.

Buck Strunk totally agree. Trump however urged his base to vote for him in the simplest terms: rapists and murderers are coming across the border‚Äîvote for me, I‚Äôll build a big wall. Try and get some perspective. 30,000 Americans are injured or killed by gun violence committed by other Americans in this country every year. A $20,000,000,000 wall will not protect you from people who want to pick fruit and vegetables.,No other country has open borders why should we

Brent Congdon if the shutdown continues it could mean no wic programs for babies, no paychecks for the real disabled folks, no I.R.S. checks that I paid into the system all year, and possibly eventually could affect social security checks just to name a few.

The money you ask he already has for the defense department from Congress last year. So he legally has the authority to build the wall without Congress.,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Ruth Mosley actually President Trump has the legal authority to build the wall all he hase  to do is to clear a state of emergency. Which he does not need Congress for and use the money from the defense department who do you think is in charge of the United States defense department? the president of the United States is the Commander in Chief of all our Armed Forces he already has the money in for the National Defense from last year. So legally he doesn't even need the Democratic party or congress once he declares martial law in a state of emergency down at the border which he legally can because it is a threat to all Americans the military will build the wall.,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Dan Burnzinsky...Thought???...ü§îü§îü§î...Did you mean THROW???...ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,BUILD THAT WALL then throw  all the democrats over it !

Kathy Smith Williams It's a joke asshole, there I can spell that huh genius!,How about all the daughters killed by Americans with guns, people that shouldn't have guns, what about that moeron?
Learie Jordan The opiate problem in this country was caused by our own drug companies, it's the reason for the demand for heroin. I have no problem with people owning guns, it's the perversion of the laws by the NRA lobby that prevent common sense guns laws that would help keep guns out of the hands of people that should not own them. This emergency declared by the idiot in chief is a manufactured lie. Someone show me that statistics that say that illegal immigrants kill more people than assholes with guns, over 300 mass shootings already this year. WTF! Moe-rons!,How about all the daughters killed by Americans with guns, people that shouldn't have guns, what about that moeron?
Cynthia D Melrose DUH! Which way did he go?,How about all the daughters killed by Americans with guns, people that shouldn't have guns, what about that moeron?
AMEN,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
How true.  But with the exception of the Legislation.  The rest of it is happening.  Its just a post to help people see a broader picture.,***Legislate clear Comprehensive Immigration and Naturalization Reform.*** Close Sanctuary districts and municipalities. *** Fully fund ICE..*** Prosecute Visa Overstays, *** Finish the Fence where it is needed. .
Greg Pyles if you put value on American lives you would actually know that gun control is your biggest issue.   You get out of the country.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Aiming tclose your bank accounts and put you in credit agencies and soon you'll have to be borrowing against your wage with lunatic interest rates each week to be paid.,Pelosi has something going on mentally.

Obamacare did NOT pass like that .https://www.dailysignal.com/2010/03/16/obamacare-slaughter-rule-is-without-precedent/,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Todd Schroeder It's amusing when a dickhead calls someone a dickhead...,Victoria A. Deobald how you know this

Rodney Martin because that is basically like taking 5 BILLION dollars and catching it on fire. We have homeless vets, hungry children, crumbling infrastructure.....this is not a time to waste that kind of money. Also, I appreciate you having a civil conversation about it with me. I enjoy speaking with adults who act like adults.,Wayne Denny absolutely
Rodney Martin we are not against better than we currently have. Walls are proven not to work, it's a fact, it would be a waste of billions of dollars then we would still have to enact other saftey precautions later. No need to waste that money! We have and will give funds to basically any other form of border security.....just not a giant wasteful ineffective wall.  I have been a democrat all my adult life and have only met ONE democrat who actually wanted open borders. To say we want open borders is false and used to create division and fear.,Wayne Denny absolutely

Jill Travassos I am a 38 year old woman with two kids AND a mortgage so maybe get your facts together before you open your mouth.,Wayne Denny absolutely
Michelle Breen then why didn't it happen when Republicans had full control?  Why wait until Dems take over KNOWING we aren't going to sign off on wasting 5 BILLION dollars on a ineffective wall?  Please explain,Wayne Denny absolutely

Ummm....I don't think drywall is going to keep out "the brownies".,If I was Trump I'd set up a scheduled meeting for Nancy Pelsoi in the oval office. But I'd lock the door and laugh and laugh and laugh when she stood on the other side saying "I can't get in!" Teach a man to fish. Walls do work. That's why we have walls.
Harry Leon Hann you must be on drugs.  SMH,My total opinion about Nancy Pelosi and why she does not want the wall is because behind the scenes I believe she's working with the drug cartels just like the other Democrats that are involved and not wanting the wall because if a wall goes up that's less money they will be receiving from the drug cartel from bringing in the drugs into our country I think she's also my opinion a part of the human trafficking that's going on in this country they don't want to give up all the illegal money blood money that they're getting off these drug cartels the people involved in the human trafficking so we'll never see the wall cuz they will fight to the end because they will be losing millions and millions of dollars every year just my opinion
William Bieke some people are complete idiots and you can't argue with stupid,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Matt Bachugan difference is apparently you are counting on yours.. for some of us it's just a bonus, some of us don't count on money that isn't in our hands.,Ryan Wasajewski 1.

Jacquelyn Scherer that‚Äôs my problem no one is telling us how we will secure our border just saying no to a wall for spite isn‚Äôt going to help.  I would like the benefits they get for seeking asylum cut off,‚ÄúWorking together to secure the border‚Äù does NOT require a wall.  Get over yourself!
Tyrone Brummeyer to long.,Helen Selgren Lyman,   Yeah, I suppose most Trumpets won't be able to concentrate long enough to finish it.  Oh well.
Martha Pickens here we go again. Just have to mention Clinton and Obama. Nothing better to come up with I guess! The defense of our nation should not be dependent on a lying, draft dodging con man. He would not know how to defend our nation nor does he have the mental capacity or intelligence to learn. You can‚Äòt say that about Clinton or Obama. Funny how we are always less safe when it is a Republican President with the scare mongering! Last time I checked 9/11 happened under a Republican. Oh and Clinton and Obama were not in bed with the Russians!,I guess that is why you are a draft dodger! How are those Bone Spurs? ROFL!
How many LIES will President Hoax be delivering in his FARCE delivered tonight from the headquarters of CENTRAL FAKE NEWS AGENCY operated out of the Oval Office???,you mean a wall?
The same thing happened to me from a man that was a US Citizen and serving in the military. The point is these things happen and the people doing so will be legal and illegal at a proportion relative to their portion of the population. Just as my situation does not mean that men in the military are bad your situation does not mean illegals are bad........only that the individuals that perpetrated this on us were bad.,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, ‚ÄúDaniel Zuniga‚Äù who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didn‚Äôt take responsibility because they said they didn‚Äôt contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found.

James Chapman Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin fake crisis is your opinion you got from media opinion. Truth is the voters, the president & Federal border agents disagree. What one would you choose, media bias or the source of people who are on the boarder, the president who has access to info no one else does, the voters who put someone in office to do a job that has gone unchecked for years? Why are the Trump Zealots alway making False Claims and False Accusations??? Sorry unlike the Trump Cult I think for myself though my observations are often later repeated on various media. I have know President hoax for decades and he has always been a very FAKE MAN and Pathological Liar that has no credibility. His whole life is built around lies. He is nothing more than a very successful snake oil and elixir salesman. I lived on the border when many more people were crossing the border at the busiest part of the border and there was no crisis or emergency.It is not true that moist people that live or work on the border want a Useless Wall that can be easily circumvented. What most people want including people that live and work there is smart border security. That is what we need. Trump has created a completely fictitious emergency so that he and his cult can get what they want which is completely wasting billions of dollars in taxpayers money. But you ain't gonna get it as We The People, and that is the great majority of American's, oppose the Wall. Trump and his Cult will not get their BOONDOGGLE WALL!!!

Betty Jo Lollis thank you! I only shared so this way people know that MOST if not ALL illegals won't accept the word "NO" I have learned from this experience and I only hope that my story will entice others to break their silence too. It's ok to talk about it. It's a BIG problem amongst other things as well.,I was working for an employer who had hired illegal immigrants and didn't notify the staff that had been working there. One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place.  Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.  I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR.  This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse  since then with the population of illegals.  Let's protect our future!

Bob Segal - 40% does not make for a high approval rating.. No matter how you spin it..,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp!

Danny Jones-thank you for your faith and support for President Trump and our country. Hope things will get better for your country.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Linda Gurtz Hildreth probably fake ones like the Obama birth certificate.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Hello dear,The way I see it is the Democratic Party is putting the American people in danger.  They aren‚Äôt agreeing on the border because Trump wants it.  They are just making themselves look really bad.  Yea, but their homes are surrounded by a wall.
,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it‚Äôs an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.

Linda Silver hahaha are u mad lol,Trump this is total Bullshit! What a Propaganda post ! We will be a Nation and "STUPID Trump" isn't gonna fly in with his tights and cape to save the day ! Trump you are so PATHETIC! Trump,your first and only priority is to open up the Government NOW, so these people can get paid ! Trump, you think that by NOT paying the Border Patrol that there won't be the cartels to swoop in with butt loads of money to tempt these people! Wow, that sounds a might bit CRAZY! There had already been CORRUPTION on the Southern Border !Trump, you are complete imbecile,pay the Coast Guard ASAP, they keep our borders "SAFE" ! If this is Not some kinda of "SiCK " game and a Political ploy to "USE" your CRAZY base,then prove it ! OPEN UP THE GOVERNMENT! I still am interested in where all the 1.6 Billion Dollars that you got in March went ? Why are you asking for an additional 5.7 Billion dollars ? Why hold these Feberal workers "Hostages" just so you can say "I won " ? It should demonstrate to the American people that you don't "Care" about the citizens of this Nation and that you are a "Greedy ,INCOMPETENT,EGOTISTICAL,,LIAR "! Trump your tweet about Schumer is very PATHETIC,you Fired Comey because of the "Russia Thing"! What Trump are you grasping at straws? Trump ,you could go today and TESTIFY to Mueller Face to Face and put it all behind you ,since all of this is just more Distraction from the Meuller investigation! Dude,you still have the option to RESIGN before you are in PRISON! Why don't you just to that,save the country money and time in your IMPEACHMENT hearings !

Buck Strunk yes, there are many other countries in Europe for example.. Had you ever been out of the United States?,No other country has open borders why should we
The Coast Guard, you know the ones who STOP all the drugs he's got you upset about....They are NOT. The welders who fix their boats? ARE NOT.  TSA, who actually stop the terrorists...are NOT. He has sacrificed EVERY US border to get a political win. Screw him and his support for it.  Don't tell me this is about border security. It's about trump's tiny penis size and slipping popularity and impending indictments.,So PAY THE F*CKING COAST GUARD. You're putting us all at risk.
The prefect metaphor for Trump supporters is a person who finds a piece of garbage on the ground and thinks it's a $100 bill. When you point it out the the person, that it's, actually, trash; instead of throwing the garbage away and saying, "thanks, " They point to another piece of garbage and SCREAM at you, "WHAT ABOUT THAT TRASH, THOUGH?!  THAT'S GARBAGE, TOO RIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT TRASH"  Sure - but I'm talking about the piece of garbage in your hand, that, still, isn't a $100 bill.,So PAY THE F*CKING COAST GUARD. You're putting us all at risk.
Punch line: I'm not a Democrat. I like Ike and Lincoln - they are ROLLING IN THEIR GRAVES AT THIS MONSTER.,So PAY THE F*CKING COAST GUARD. You're putting us all at risk.
We are less safe than we were for this. That's on the Trumper-tantrum.,So PAY THE F*CKING COAST GUARD. You're putting us all at risk.

Lynn Limauro Floyd  sorry to another broken heart üíî,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL

Ricky Wallace that's a lie.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Victor Manuel that may be but until you've visited the border you have no idea what it's like.  I'm sorry but it depends on who you ask as to which story you will get,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Dave Callender get your head out of the sand,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Chris Cjkodaharianna made me laugh outloud! Well said!!,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Ruben Radar Rodriguez  more people like u need to speak out!!! People need to stop being quiet because they are scared,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Marj Mansley Calderwood Stan is just telling the Truth.As a democrat that was not a Trump supporter, Trump has done more for our country and Gods will than any president since Kennedy who drafted me in 1963. I thank God for all those christians in those vast red states to elect president Trump.I did not like what Trump had done in his life before he bacame president either. I also would not have liked Paul, David, or Moses those awful  sinners God used to do his will.If God put Trump there, God will keep him there, even if you an I didn't like him Marj.,Thank you America for electing him üåüüíØüå∑‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üíãüá∫üá∏

socialist, globalist, call them what you will. we need a new joseph mccarthy right now,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.

Estefania Torres Restrepo California  LARGEST INSANE ASYLUM IN THE WORLD  Interesting that the LA Times did this. All the others are staying away from it. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this should be of great interest to you!  Just One State - be sure and read the last part...  try for 3 times.  This is only one State... If this doesn't open your eyes, nothing will!  From the LA. Times:  1. 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right)  2. 95 %of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.  3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.  4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.  5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.  6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.  7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.  8 Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.  9. 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking.  10. In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.  (All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times)  Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare.

Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin this does not even take into account the NAFTA deal he negotiated..The part media fails to inform you of is what the NAFTA deal means and how Mexico IS going to pay.... I'll explane...  ~It forces USA metal to be used *(HUGE for American jobs and American steel sales generating billions) and it will keep automobile manufactures in the USA (worth billions).  ~Americans bought $71 billion more imports YEARLY from Mexico than vice versa. That's about to change in Americans favor.   ~At least 30% of the cars must be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour to keep American car manufactures in the USA (That increases to 40% in 2023:) Autos that don't meet these requirements will be subject to hefty tariffs.   ~Canada must open up its dairy market to U.S. farmers. It will eliminate its complex pricing scheme for Class 7 products. That includes milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder, and infant formula etc.   ~It opens the wine market in British Columbia to American wine. (Billions to America).  ~Mexican trucks must meet U.S. safety standards before crossing the border.   ~Provides more protection for patents and trademarks. Saving tons to American's who have been ripped off of their ideas & costs Americans billions and also helps reduce black market.   ~U.S. drug companies can sell products in Canada for 10 years before facing generic competition. Extending it by 2 years. (Billions generated)  ~Companies can no longer use Chapter 11 to resolve disputes with governments, they will now have to pay up instead. The only exceptions are U.S. oil companies.   ~We no longer fund Mexican abortion clinics. Exports drastically reduced, for one example sugar from Mexico cut nearly in half, creating more jobs and revenue, tourism industry hit hard, federal employees banned from traveling to certain main areas.  *Of course, Trump didn't really expect Mexico to just write the US a check as some ignorantly say as "fact" :),Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens! üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è

Belinda Price   Agree , call National Emergency, Shut down folks go back to work , Build The Wall,Dear Sir: I agree with you wholeheartedly, however, it is the people you serve to protect that are being penalized. Call off the shut down. Call a National Emergency, if you must. But get this resolved QUICK!
Denise Jacks   Next time pay all government employees but do not pay Congress since they collectively cause the problems.,What the Government should learn from this shutdown is that people ‚Äúdo not‚Äù have 6 months savings for an emergency!  That needs to be addressed!!
Derrick J Johnston   It‚Äôs winter and cold outside, nothing to do but have some fun  replying. Hopefully spring comes soon.,I came here for the comments. (Was not disappointed) I find it halarious that everyone needs a voice on social media instead of a hobby in real life... maybe everyone should go outside for a bit...

why are you so stupid,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Eddy Coulson, why are you such a shithead? I suppose you want to open up the border and abort babies "you people" should be aborted starting with your mother after all she had defective children. I bet you are Gay..........üñïüí©here a picture of your mother and your brain.........ü§£,Still,  using children's deaths to make political points.  Trump is one sad lowlife.  Your gun deaths are your national emergency
ok mr know it all what would,I'm sure a wall would have prevented all the school shootings that happened last year
Go to school learn to spell you are a subhuman species.,Great. Waste beelions on a wall that the illegal immigrant probably flew over.
you are dog ass stupid,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Why don't you stay focused, to damn stupid,James Ellis great response, keyboard warrior.
Their kids are already brain dead,It won't change until a Democrat in Congress loses a child.
My bet is his "8 minute" speech will be 14 mins and 22 lies. But I'm probably lowballing the lies.,Vicki Zamow he let in the country.
Homo?  First off, I'm straight.  Second off - love how republicans try to claim a moral high ground while also using an entire classification of people as a euphamism for "stupid". I'm positive Jesus would approve.,More terrorists come in from canada than mexico. Drugs come through legal ports of entry.  Stop holding the country hostage, ahab
Rachelle Tanzil lol no the didn‚Äôt tell me where republicans stopped obama on anything?,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Lee Grant  And you're a fool, or a bot. Are you so stupid that you think the rest of the world isn't affected by your country's activities or your mentally retarded President? Get a life, idiot!,Oh, go grow one, Donald. Your most important duty was pretty null and void when you deferred . . .  what was it . . .  five times? What a useless excuse of a man!
Larry Favre - I didn't mention rigged elections to point fingers, or go off on a red herring tangent.  There has been plenty of evidence of elections being "rigged" across the country, and likely even more that has gone undetected.  That was not the point of my proposal.  ASK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC directly, and stop relying on whether the President, or Congress thinks it is a good idea.  After all, they ALL work for us - - so IF the majority actually want the wall, then the debate would be over, and they should fund it.  IF the majority does not want the wall, then those who do can find ways to fund it without Congress.  Either way, crossing the border must be done legally, so who is in favor of enforcing our laws on entering the United States?  Let's not be afraid of the truth!,Let's have an official special issue vote for the border wall at local election sites.  Only those who can prove they were born in the U.S., or are legal citizens may vote.  No fake polls or rigged election.  No mail in ballots, or dead people voting.  Let's find out how many Americans support our President and really want this southern border barrier built.  If the public says to fund it, then the Congress MUST fund it.  My guess is that at least 3/4 of the whole population want the wall built.  Democrats are afraid of the truth!
Tom Caskey Awww - did I trigger a liberal who slaps back with a huge informal fallacy.  I didn't provide any "numbers" as facts.  I said, "my guess" which is clearly an opinion.  I proposed a vote be taken to find out how many people really support the wall.  You must be one of those Democrats who are afraid of the truth.  You talk loudest, and think that means you are in the majority.  üòÜüòÖüòÇü§£,Let's have an official special issue vote for the border wall at local election sites.

Lora Hill Well one reason is all the mainstream media will show is some women and kids trying to come in. Not the thousands of drug runners who terrorize anyone who gets in your way. Or the one officer who covers 1000 square miles. Are the families whose lives are threatened by the cartels.,Oh my god some one needs to give me a call because I live down south and illegals kill our animals and breaking in to houses while children are sleeping to steal; there are barrels set out with high flags with Augua to stop them from damaging our property
Lora Hill it's has to stop now or we will become a 3rd world country. But that's what the globalist are hoping for. I for one don't know what to do but get ready to fight. Just wanting on someone to say GO!!,Oh my god some one needs to give me a call because I live down south and illegals kill our animals and breaking in to houses while children are sleeping to steal; there are barrels set out with high flags with Augua to stop them from damaging our property
Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets.

If schools would actually do something about the bullies in their schools, we wouldn't have half the shootings we do now. The schools claim to have zero tolerance, but when you actually report it, they claim that kids will be kids. So you want safety inside, then they need to fix their bullying policies, and start expelling all kids that have been know to bully others. This is the schools problem to fix, not Trumps.,How about safety in schools‚Äîoh yeah you said you would send prayers.

Sometimes it is just time to grow a pair and make a change.
Brent Robinson He should have started in 2017 when the republicans were the majority he wouldn‚Äôt be playing the blame game,,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down.

I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Kenny Shuster get your head out of your ass we need the wall,The Wall is a figment and an fixation of Trump's sick twisted narcissistic mind! Mr. President!! Get help!!

No, that isn‚Äôt at all what it is like. A wall is a moronic idea that will never happen with or without the funding because the land is privately owned. It will be tied up in courts for decades! It is an unnecessary waste of resources. Since you people resist reliable news sources, I strongly suggest you start looking at objective data. Court filings, the US Army Risk Assessment..,etc. Or, don‚Äôt and be gobsmacked when you find out just how idiotic your comments were, and how close you came to losing the country you profess to love.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Lorrie Tracy  Rod Novoa is one of those aoc douche bags that wants free free free while sitting on his ass doing nothing.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Linda Sonn lol he don't need money. He gets no pay to put up with idoits. Your really some kind of Stupid!,There has never been a MORE DISGUSTING PERSON IN AMERICA  THEN THE TRAMP.  YOU HATE AMERICA BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BARROW MONEY FROM AMERICAN BANKS. YOU HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO COURT BECAUSE YOU DON'T PAY PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR YOU. PLUS SOOOO MUCH MORE. I'LL BE DANCING IN THE STREETS WHEN YOU AND YOUR CRIME FAMILY ARE IN ORANGE PRISON SUITS. POS
Rebecca Thomsen Koskey aren't you even curious to read the article? A little too much Truth for you huh? Scary words like the Supreme Court and judges and lawyers and facts. Yes, facts. You know those things that your Lord and Master is allergic to? Hold on to your hat honey and make sure that your Depends undergarments are fastened securely from here on out. Because it's about to hit the fan royally.,William Bieke he keeps his Campaign lies at the expense and the suffering of the American citizen. Pull your head out of your ass.
Rebecca Thomsen Koskey yes ma'am thank you for pointing that out! I absolutely hate when my country is raped and pillaged and destroyed by a traitor. And I'm sorry for you that you are not. But you see, we all are not conned and we are not easily bought for a temporary tax break and a handful of empty promises. I've known who Donald Trump is since 1980. You're soon going to find out who you put in the White House. Your denial of it does not make it any less true.,William Bieke he keeps his Campaign lies at the expense and the suffering of the American citizen. Pull your head out of your ass.
Lily-Ann Silva if you mean Donald Trump, he works on my dime. He does what I want. He's a public servant. And no, he is not allowed to be himself. We were all hoping that he would tone himself down, listen to his advisors and his generals and the people that have more experience in government than him. He could have done this right, he could have combined his knowledge of finance and their knowledge of politics, government and Military and been a good president. But no. He's got to act like a thug or a spoiled two-year-old and do all kinds of fucked up stuff AND lie every single day of his presidency. The fact that this country doesn't care that our president lies every time he opens his mouth is a disgusting situation. And it's worth being angry over. This is not what our forefathers OR the millions of people who shed their blood for our freedom had in mind. We have no allies. He's pulling us out of every single peaceful agreement that we have worked so hard to be part of and lead the world with. You better hope nobody drops a bomb on us. Nobody would come to our rescue. Not even Canada.,William Bieke he keeps his Campaign lies at the expense and the suffering of the American citizen. Pull your head out of your ass.
Lily-Ann Silva a minor point at such a moment. I think you're on the wrong thread.,William Bieke he keeps his Campaign lies at the expense and the suffering of the American citizen. Pull your head out of your ass.

Eyon Deen what an idiot and crybaby,WHEN YOU TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE DUMB-ASS...YOU PROMISED THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR YOUR STUPID BORDER WALL. WHY ARE YOU NOW DEMANDING FUNDS FROM CONGRESS,, JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A FUCKING SORE LOSER?? Manage
Another of Trump's lies! The DNC does want border security; but not a stupid, unaffordable wall!,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin  ok I will bite; LIES, FARCE, CENTRAL FAKE NEWS AGENCY, explain.
The Democrats want to help the country by stopping Trump from destroying it!,Janet Wood its the Dems destroying by not wanting to secure the border! We can't take in all of Mexico and central America and give them benefits!!!
Liz Livingston This analogy is getting old and furthermore not even relevant!,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Andrea Berkstresser this doomsday propaganda is killing me,Excellent!! Thank you ladies and thank you Mr. President!! The wall will be built,  stay strong and defeat this attempted coup by Pelosi and gang or America will be lost.
Bonnie Massey how do we tell President Trump we want him to resign I think that there should be a petition for all Americans to be able to sign,How do we tell Nancy and Shurmer we want them to resign I think that should be a petition all Americans should be able to sign also because every where I go it's all I hear people saying they.

John Robert We the People have power and we should use that power whenever we can right now the Democrat Party is being nothing but obstructionist and we can give them our opinion by calling them.

If you call and leave a message try to be civil but aggressively push 4 a barrier at our Southern border. Thank you,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Gary Kane .....we will send them to your house....Address please!!!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
They are not going unpaid the military is being paid the house is being payed the Congress is being paid. If it was another president that wants this it would be passed with no problem. But the selfish people who want to control our rights and doesn't care about the American people will stop it. What happened to supporting your president what happened to America sticking together the problem is everyone wants to blame the president for everything that is wrong in this country they need to look back on the pervious president and see what they did wrong. The way I see it is this is the only president that all you people out there are criticizen on. It seems like no matter what the problem is it's the president falt when are the people going to Stat take blame for their own actions. The only thing the president is trying to do is make our country safe again, get the drugs the murders and the human trafficking out of our country. I believe in our president and will support our president and I think more people should stand up. Instead of all the hate this country has they should come together to make our country great again.,Border security all the way
I think it's higher.,CBS stated before the President spoke that their polls show only 59% of the people want the wall.  I CALL BULLSHIT!
Sarah Knutson they are not laughing they  are crying because Trump evened the trading field and countries are not sucking Americans dry anymore.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...

Dennis J Sitko they‚Äôre our citizens and they will be punished. We don‚Äôt need criminals from other countries.,What about the thousands killed in mass murders by white American citizens
Jason Erhardt a lot of those crimes against immigrants are done by illegal aliens.  Build the wall and enforce our laws,Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
Katie Hamilton Kramer that particular girl wouldn‚Äôt be dead if her killer was in his own  country and had not broken the law by coming here illegally.,Conservatives- DoNt PoLiTiCizE gUn DeAtHs, sTuPiD DeMs  Also Conservatives- Politicize deaths at the hands of illegal immigrants.   UPDATE- You are just as dead if you're killed by an illegal immigrant as you are by a legal citizen. Only difference is, more people are killed by legal citizens every year than illegals lol. BaN uS cItIzEns!!
Lark Jarvis you must think you have a lot more knowledge than the men who work for border patrol and deal with situations at the border every day. They do think a wall will help.  I think a lot of people like you just don‚Äôt want it to help.,Statistics don‚Äôt bear out this story. Anecdotal evidence is not statistics. You can cherry pick stories, but it doesn‚Äôt change reality. A wall is ineffective and a waste.
Link Lindquist this post is not about immigrants, it‚Äôs about illegal aliens,For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of ‚Äúcriminality‚Äù ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of ‚Äúfelonies‚Äù have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized.
Mary Zaggy so??? Did anyone say he was?,The guy who massacred FIVE people in Illinois yesterday was not an undocumented immigrant.
Michala Dotson we‚Äôre not talking about immigrants, we‚Äôre talking about ILLEGAL aliens. There IS a difference.,We have criminals on the daily that are citizens including every shooter lately who happens to be a white nazi supremacist that also happens to be extreme supporters of Trump but every once in a while an immigrant commits a crime, big or small, and that's all that matters. Not the REAL crime problem of actual citizens. By no means am I supporting a killer but using it as a political boost is ridiculous.
Oliver Oriel it certainly will be a lot harder for them. I say we stop making it so easy. Build the wall.,Walls can't stop a determined immigrant, he/she can either chose to dig an underground tunnel or even climb over the wall...how about you just come up with a good policy.
Piper Tunno the shooters are either dead or in prison.  We have criminal citizens who are punished. We don‚Äôt need to add illegal criminals from other countries to the ones we already have.,Do their lives matter more than the multiple children killed each year in mass school shootings?
Raja Ali none,How many native Americans your family killed
Shady Ghaly you must live in a state that has really high taxes.,Claiming 7 ??. You have no idea what you are talking about
Steve Ware what‚Äôs your point? Every country has bad citizens that do bad things. That‚Äôs why we have prisons. That doesn‚Äôt mean we want illegal people from other countries that also includes bad people.  We have enough of our own to take care of.,While this is a tragic story, I can't help but wonder how many illegals kill Americans vs how many Americans kill Americans. Would be an interesting comparison to start with.
Sue Howie what does one thing have to do with another? We can do better about making sure our gun laws are followed and at the same time build the wall make sure our immigration laws are followed.,Kris Kline Give sources..

First of all, I have sympathy for these people trying to find a better life but the US cannot continue to take care of these people.  It is costing us billions of dollars monthly now.  Can you imagine the cost if we allow droves of them to come as these caravans from central America are coming?  Once you let some in, nearly all from those countries will be here.  We have our own needy to take care of and doing a somewhat shabby job of that.                                  How many are you willing to sponsor, Art?,The wall along with better technology, more personal, etc will all work together as our CBP has recommended.  We need to include more drug sniffing dogs.  They do a great job.

Sally Gillespie Bailey the president is stupid plain and simple!! Screw Trump and the wall!,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!
Jason Epp and yet every poll said he had no chance of winning and yet he did,*Fox news polls basically show support from the base but nobody else lmao
Kathleen Scott our guy Dan Crenshaw is an example of the kind of congressman all of your states should want. He literally refused his pay check until other government workers get paid. That's integrity.,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Robert White dumbasses everywhere lol,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
Jason Cefai The polls weren't wrong, he lost the popular vote by 2 million.,*Fox news polls basically show support from the base but nobody else lmao
Another chump supporter informed, check.,Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
Cindy Sue no illegal immigrants do not get social security. Your so clueless! They pay their bills, they buy things, they work, they eat.  Just how do you think anyone that lives in America gets out of all taxes, work, and bills?   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/20/trumps-false-claim-that-undocumented-immigrants-collect-social-security-benefits/?utm_term=.b87654fbfa1b,Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
Cindy Sue wrong about 11,000,000 illegal immigrants are currently in America only about 55% are Mexican but chump wont tell you that. Chump does not mention any illegal immigrants that have white skin.,Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
Fyi they take care of themselves for the most part. They work and pay over 300 billion in taxes.   http://immigrationimpact.com/2018/04/16/undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes/,Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many.

Bert Bowers if his mom did anal we wouldn't have to deal with him,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Christopher Curry  According to the Democrats,  came through the port of entry and put his name on the list so they can keep account  (statistics), they talk about them all the time !,How did that illegal get here?
Victoria A. Deobald  That's interesting considering she doesn't support Israel and she supports all the reasons 9/11 happened.,Imagine if Hillary had been elected  !
Mike Kizy id rather have a tax cut for whomever makes under 100k,Protect us from Russia.
Peggy-Lynn Reeves A good portion has the Rio Grande, not desert area. It‚Äôs feasible, look at the Suez Canal.,Turn that border into a canal! Dig it deep enough that the sides become a natural wall. Then the US and Mexico get trade growth from the canal being used, and we get a deterrent to illegal border crossings!
Letitia Werle  were you there personally watching them do this or are you a total liar just like Donald duck trump,Several thousand illegals climbed over a fence into New Mexico last night and no one stopped them...several thousand mostly men.  Build the Wall!
Marcos Ramirez I guess his accomplishments mean nothing, it‚Äôs cool just wake up with hate in your heart and MSN in your ears,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Lee N Kristen Wilcox so no facts just name calling?  Ok good for you,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Unless you're Natave American, you can STFU! Those crayons you're eating are effecting your IQ.ü§°,Lil Donny, your at a point where you are losing biggly! Good luck with that wall idea of yours. ü§óü§©üçæü•Ç Also I agree, his address should first be put on paper.
John King yes! Let's start with Mar A Lago. There's a host of illegals working there.,There is no doubt that Pelosi will reject the President's latest offer. That being the case I would:   Immediately proclaim a national crisis and get the military building barriers.  Secondly, I would let ICE loose. By that I would have them raid thousands of businesses and immediately deport any illegals found. As a nice measure I would give a 1 week notice that these raids are about to begin. Thirdly, along with deportation I would arrest either the hiring HR director, or if no one fits that description, arrest the front line supervision for hiring illegals.   Lastly, I would implement a 25% fee on ANY monies wired to Mexico and Central America.   If the President would implement a get tough program I would guess Pelosi would come begging to finally get this immigration issue solved once and for all. This crap needs to end.
Uhm... we don't. You don't need a wall to have border security,No other country has open borders why should we
Cindy Ann Godfrey if you hate are President so much why are you following him Troll Much,Mitchell James lol didn‚Äôt bother looking did you
Paulo Americo Rocha very few attempt crossing the desert it is a very long and arduous Journey through train that most of the year will kill you from dehydration in less than a day.  I assure you it is much easier and more common for someone to hop in the trunk of a car then it is to cross the Sonoran Desert.,The vast majority of illegal immigrants that cross the southern border enter this country do so in cars through ports of entries how is the wall going to stop them?
Bullshit,The promise was , Mexico is gonna pay for it
Buck Strunk we don't have open borders dumbshit. You need a passport to come in,No other country has open borders why should we
The wall will never be built, it's just a hoax... If someone wanted it to be built, they'd make it happen, LMAO... Don't be a puppet...  There's so much more to the story..,Why don't you and other millionaires buy the wasteland properties along this border and do as you wish with your private property... A wall doesn't have to be on an exact line of property.  They built gas pipelines for miles and miles through citizens property.  You're telling me property can't be bought that runs close to the border in a zigzag line that has a private wall built on it's property???
Anne Crossway vote your conscience, I sure will!,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
Kenneth Armstrong thanks, revolutionary insight from the fourth grade Ken. Hoping the President can find the same loopholes your liberal base uses to fund every Democratic Socialist program they think up.,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway.

Juanita Craner but mumbers show immigration is low,Thank you, President Trump!! If there has ever been a time to declare an emergency, it's now!! Invasion of our country IS a dire emergency! Unlike weather emergencies, the problem with invasions from our southern border will not "blow over", but will only get worse. Thank you for your work and determination to prevent our beautiful country from being turned into another Mexico. Behind you 100%! May God bless you and all your endeavors!
Linda Gayle Hutson is good they are doing that to the president,The financial records of Every Politician who oppose border security needs to be openly investigated and made public! Those who scream the loudest should be investigated first! You don‚Äôt oppose security unless you are profiting from it!

Mary Larkin American people will receive a smaller refund this year after filing their income tax returns. The Republican/Trump tax cuts is a big scam that only benefits the rich. That's all Paul Ryan wanted; he got it and ran away.    ‚ÄúLower tax refunds might hurt the economy. If Americans are getting less money back, that might mean they're going to spend less of their refund.‚Äù - Jordan Valinsky  Your (small) refunds will be delayed thanks to President Donald Trump‚Äôs shutdown.

Move south,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Araceli Rodriguez Move south,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Stephen Pierson Speaking of dumbasses, you know other presidents have declared emergencies before, right? Hell, Carter even did it during the Iranian Hostage crisis. Learn some history before posting stupid stuff dumbdick,Good speech yesterday. Most people found it to be common sense, although common sense isn't very common in democrats. I would put a timeline on it though and declare an emergency if they don't react. A lot of Feds are behind you, but we can't hang on forever. Build that wall!
Yeah, if we dont' get the wall with Trump, we never will,I believe that TRUMP will be the last American president who will fight as hard for America as he does, all future republican presidents will fold because of their fear of the democraps calling them names like they always do.
look it up on youtube they are there especially hillary. otherwise  go back to msnbc..troll,while addressing the nation tonight they should play the clips of all the hypocrite dems endorsing the wall in the past.

Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.
Arnold Ringer idiot,This isn't Trump's shut down, it's Putin's shut down.  Trump is doing Putin's bidding by crippling our society by its foundation.  Can't you see that Trump is tearing us apart by the seams, he divides us, propelling our young to animalistic hate.  Does this make you feel good?
Danny Joe Gardner wrong,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Dawn Joseph-Hernandez not the point idiot illegal why cant you idiots understand illegal is against the law,oh please! americans are killing americans by the thousands every day!!!! look at the news!

Adonus Lloyd I‚Äôm not worried about it. If they wanna get our guns let them there are over 5million Americans with guns who would laugh at them trying to get them. No one is going to put them down I say about out of the 5 million maybe 100 thousand would disarm them selves that‚Äôs about it.,Don't be surprised if he does an assault weapons ban cause he already ban bump stocks. He use to support the assault weapon ban years before he ran for president. He has already went against the promises he has made.

But I never go to doctors for sniffles....we farmed and knew how to stop the illness of our livestock.And everything else that goes along with a lifestyle of working for others...it's not just a job.But we couldn't afford health insurance. My husband was a very successful business man but we had no control over the price of our products.I worked for nothing but insurance for the last two years of his life at a school till  he passed from a rare neurological disease at 64. Insurance may not have prevented his death,but the quality of his life would have been improved.It can happen to anyone....no sniffles here.......cause I know the difference between life and death...and what a wall can and cannot do.,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.

Larry Lubiner why?? Because it's true?,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Well he got Korea to stop launching missiles, he gotten Korea to release hostages, he got Korea to return our fallen soldiers, tax cuts for US citizens, more jobs, brought back jobs that past administrations shut down, prison reform for people that gets out of prison. Ect. But i think keeping us from going to war with North Korea and stopping the missiles flying our way was priority, don't you?,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Ruben Radar Rodriguez bahahahahahahahahaha,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Jo Sechi And your point is?,I love that Donald J. Trump is working to protect Americans and he is acknowledging these angel parents to help them heal. ‚ù§ May their children's deaths not be in vain.
Jo Sechi Surely you're not implying that deaths caused by illegals are less significant because they are fewer than gun related deaths? And to go all the way back to 1968 to inflate the number? How many gun related deaths last year? This year so far? How many of those are outside Chicago? Don't preach to me about gun control. The number of American babies murdered since 1968 far outnumber the American lives lost to guns. SIT DOWN.,I love that Donald J. Trump is working to protect Americans and he is acknowledging these angel parents to help them heal. ‚ù§ May their children's deaths not be in vain.
James Kenney Obama sure did.  Thank goodness we have Trump.  MAGA 2020!!,agree 100%!  Thank you for all you are doing (and trying) to do.
Timothy Norton I would propose both. Seeing as the numbers of people coming are overwhelming.,I don't know how how she sleeps at night.
Bethany Kessel  actually by building the wall it will free up billions of dollars that are used to house, feed, medical and legal fees that are used on illegal immigrants when they are caught. So by lowering the amount of illegal immigrants that are flooding into this country will free up money that can be used to help the American citizens.,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don‚Äôt support it. Don‚Äôt say we.
Richard McGrath who cares?,BUILD THE WALL MAGA ALL THE WAY!!!!
Angie Small-Double I agree.  President Trump is amazing!  MAGA!,Stand strong, build the wall
Nick Demico and so they can use that against him in the election saying see he didn't get the wall built,Hey here's the problem the dumbrats and George Bush talked about border security. They also talked about building wall I meant a fence. But the fact is none of them had the balls to get it done. So now with one more year till the 2020 election  the dumbrats don't want the  wall built because they won't have those illegal Voters. The Dumbrats also don't won't Trump to go in the history books as a President that kept he's promise to the American People awhile keeping America Safe  and also making America Great once again.
Kris Landers if a known serial killer was loose in your neighborhood would you lock your doors? An illegal immigrant is a KNOWN criminal, therefore statistically more likely to engage in other illegal practices. Its really simple, logical, and moral.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Kris Landers so those who befriend or stand behind illegals are to blame for illegals actions? I like that idea.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

Amanda Parker-Leinart I honestly agree with the shut down people need to wake up and see that America is more important,Jennifer Ogelvie  That's not the way. What if his choice of shut down was where you worked? The politicians just took a holiday vacation with pay.... those 800,000 that are furloughed or working with no pay had no dog in this fight. Most of them live paycheck to paycheck. They didn't deserve this.
It‚Äôs all about the wall. That‚Äôs it. Just the wall. That‚Äôs all you speak of anymore. Why aren‚Äôt you fighting to fix the healthcare system?,I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs more important to me. And why I voted for you. Healthcare.
Vicki Zamow hell yeah he was!!,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
But if that illegal immigrant wouldn't have been here...,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
But if that illegal immigrant wouldn't have been here...,Jennifer Yvonne Croff you are right, but i could also blame alcohol: if there wouldn‚Äôt be alcohol she would be alive. Should alcohol be banned?

There are far more criminals and murderers  that are white Americans ,  not to mention all the other American gangs and criminals than the 0.0132% of illegals that are criminals.

Trump supporters , you have no relevance. You are a Trump supporter. You obviously have no common sense, no morals, and are too gullible to have an intellectual opinion, since you are dumb enough to support Trump. You have been conned. A damn wall really? A wall to swim or boat around, because the wall can't block waterways. A wall to dig under, because they haven't been building mile long tunnels across the border already. A wall they can't climb over, blast or cut through like they have done. A wall they can't fly over....I mean, Trump supporters have no common sense, to know it's a waste of money.

Kathy Werbicki, the man baby doesn't know what work is! In less than two years he has golfed and vacationed more than our last president did in 8 years! He has done so while profiting off of us tax paying Americans, by staying and playing as privately owned Resorts and golf courses. He is a con man. The Democrats have said every day for him to re-open the government!

I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
Why do you think he is the best,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Mike Maynard That is not true at all. No Democrat ever has called for open borders. Republicans just like to say that's what Democrats want. But no Democrat has ever said that. If you do not have a social security number you can't vote in the US. So no illegals can vote for Democrats or Republicans. Democrats win more often then Republicans, because they show human compassion more often then Republicans. The vast majority of the people in this country want that from their leaders more then the strong arm approach. You don't have to agree with me on the surface. But just think critically as to why the last three Republican presidents only won the electoral college and not the popular vote, while the last 3 Democratic presidents won the electoral college and the popular vote.,No other country has open borders why should we

I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Bobby Wilson you ARE talking to the DEMOCRATS in Congress, right?! ü§î,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Curtis Rice Don't make posts when you are drunk.  I did it before and it always comes out wrong.  Just trying to help.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.

John Wheeler  Well John, the answer is simple. Nancy and Chuck can allow $5.7 billion for our security wall, which is peanuts, and everybody immediately goes back to work.  Or....the Democrats continue to allow open borders in order to harvest votes from hundreds of thousands, even millions eventually, of illegal non citizens from several South American countries.

Dave Heffner it‚Äôs already illegal to cross the border,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it‚Äôs an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.

Samuel Tan Yuan Han Most illegal immigrants overstay their visas.. How‚Äôs a wall gonna address that issue?,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it‚Äôs an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
John N Karen Morris  report drunk driving,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.
Nancy McGill Trump doesn't give a damn about DACA kids either...or the kids he stole from their parents at the border...or the kids of the 800,000 unpaid workers. He only cares about himself.....,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.

Your statistic doesn't hold any proof... especially if you live in El Paso, Tx,Sympathies to the family but the odds of her being killed by a mass shooter in school, or by a drunk American are statistically higher than what happened here.   The courts failed long before he got to her.   There is nothing in these articles that say why he was illegal, just that he was suspected of being illegal.  Did he overstay a visa?  Is he a DACA kid?    Too many unknowns.
Same surveys that said Hillary would win in a landslide I'll warrant.,James Jerome  Surveys have already been taken, and most Americans DON'T want the wall! I know you categorize that as fake news, but those are the FACTS! Your post also infers massive voter fraud by Democrats! That also has been DEBUNKED! If anything, there has been voter fraud and suppression by the Republicans! As for TRUTH, Trump promised Mexico would pay for the wall! What happened with that?
,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Look, have you ever in your life been to the Mexico border in any state that it‚Äôs shared? I have a couple of times. It‚Äôs just as dangerous as being in the woods and walking past a hungry bear before winter. Women are raped and their clothes are left on trees as trophies! You‚Äôre clueless! Hopefully trump builds his wall so when you get old and die your kids left behind have some protection! Protect our borders. Build a wall!,You are playing the stupidest game with semantics.  Replace the term ‚Äúborder security‚Äù with wall and the statement is false.  You need to recognize we all want secure borders, your the dim wit that keeps making it about a wall

Ann Stevens one way or another, Mexico pays,Ron Wissler Now that‚Äôs intelligent ..
Thanks Ruben. Ignore the Dims spewing hatred.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Did I say import more criminals ? I dont see that in my comment ? But you cant go around blaming immagrants for every bad thing that happens and say nothing when your own does the same.,Lol theres people killed daily, Americans killing americans , theres shootings very often and they're usually American people and you use Immagrants as an excuse to build a wall? President trump is pathetic, the same goes to his followers that without any proof believe all the lies mr moron says
Buck Strunk if all the other countries decided to jump off of a bridge, would you do it?,No other country has open borders why should we

LOL...I thought it was a beautiful and effective point in his address. We do not build walls because of hatred of those on the outside, but for the  love of those on the inside, I am over this WALL nonsense. They need to secure our borders. It is not a racial issue. They need to call it a Place of Entry. Every country deserves this.,Wayne Elliott yes because he wasn't living the dream before the Oval Office. I think his own whale was just fine.
Linda Lynch you know that isn't the only issue. If an American commits murder, they are prosecuted and laws are put in place. Your point is silly.,Last year in the U.S. over 12,000 people were shot and killed by American citizens and Trump fights tooth and nail to prevent any common sense gun control. About a half dozen people are killed by undocumented aliens and Trump demands that we spend billions of dollars building a wall. I guess he doesn't think that it matters if your child is killed by a fellow American....I guess he thinks you will only mourn for them if they are killed by an undocumented person.
Rick Scott their faces already did from botox,your rigth they are ugly
Alix Kruz   Oh yes, if it‚Äôs in the news, it‚Äôs got to be true.  LOL,Turns out that there was rigging going on in the 2016 election, and Trump was steering it too!  #CrookedTrump

Dale Murphy I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt care.

The constitution clearly states that congress controls the purse strings.   This has not been a priority for either parties since the inauguration in 2017.    Congress does not give the executive branch money.     https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-constitution-and-the-federal-budget-process/,Declares a national emergency, also states it isn‚Äôt an emergency, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need to do this, but I‚Äôd rather do it much faster.‚Äù  And goes to Mar-largo  I‚Äôm confused.

Why should two thirds be held hostage to one third?  Please answer these two questions without name calling or deflections?,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

Angela K Christensen You can‚Äôt have national security without border security. It‚Äôs not only necessary for any meaningful immigration reform; border security plays a crucial role in both the interdiction of illegal drugs and in defending America against criminal threats. Weak borders allow criminal and smugglers, as well as millions of illegal aliens, to have virtually free entrance to the United States.  If this was not true then why are there some 20 million ILLEGAL aliens living in the United States now, and why is there a drug epidemic killing thousands of Americans every year, and why are Americans being robbed and murdered by Illegal aliens.  Contrary to news reports the majority of these drugs are traceable to drug cartels in Mexico, not from pharmaceutical companies.,WHY is declaring a National Emergency to address a National Emergency in The United States considered wrong? There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, "homes of the rich and famous‚Äù and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers"  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year." (* 2017, FAIR's)  This does not include cost of loss of life, property, and Democratic stability.

Barry Davis.  You obviously have zero understanding of American history and the presidents who have given their time and talents to improving the life of Americans ... unlike trump who is only tearing down institutions and programs that we the people have established through our elected representatives throughout the decades.  You are obviously oblivious to the fact that unlike any other American president trump has given more to our enemy Putin who probably controls him or has something on him that he is obviously concealing.  If you don't agree tell me another American president who invited Russians and their media into the White House while not having OUR media there and where he spilled Israeli secrets to the russians.

Kyle Callender ....Control laws TAKE lives......  The more guns in civilian hands equals less crime and safer communities.  Every year in the US guns are used millions of times to stop criminal actions.  By contrast a relatively few innocent people are killed with one.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.

And over 40% of illegals come by AIR,There are too many innocent people being murdered every day and if you look at it long and hard you can see that it all is happening because there is no border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.  Weather it is from their drugs laced with fentanyl or weapons they brought with them or illegal immigrants who think the laws do not exist or pertain to them.  Build the wall and make them come through legally and catch the drugs and weapons at the port of entry!  We can't take care of our own.  Why are we still taking care of them.  The money it takes to build the wall will be cheaper in the long run from the money we save from Narcon used to save drug attics, medical, shelter and feeding illegal immigrants not to mention the loss of life we have to endure having them here.

Several weeks ago tons of Fentanyl was confiscated at the border, enough to kill thousands!!!! Yes, Jo do some fact checking BUT DO it through a reputable source. My advice; Christian based news, Washington media research, call your senator's to keep informed of bills being passed!!!! STOP listening to bias propaganda, it make your debate ridulious.
Carl Ostendarp On the guns there is a minor stumbling block for fools like you - it‚Äôs called THE CONSTITUTION!  I hope you know what that is! And your thought isn‚Äôt new, you are just repeating the usual canned lying liberal talking points!,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Beverly Hurst Smith he didn't have the votes. Needed 8 democraps voting with Republicans.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Brian Feeley Chuck Schumer is the biggest HYPOCRITE GOING!!!!,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
How come we can give Israel money to the tune of around $3 Billion annually and they are using some of that money to build walls and none of our politicians complain about how they're "wasting money on walls" in Israel?? The U.S. is partially funding those walls along with the Iron Dome anti-missile system! Yet not one word about the walls in Israel from Schumer or Pelosi!!!! They are 2 hypocrites! We also gave some money to Jordan and Saudi Arabia! We give money to everyone!!!!! Enough! Secure our border!,I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.
Jessica Amse I‚Äôm not using Trump.fantasy stats,Sympathies to the family but the odds of her being killed by a mass shooter in school, or by a drunk American are statistically higher than what happened here.   The courts failed long before he got to her.   There is nothing in these articles that say why he was illegal, just that he was suspected of being illegal.  Did he overstay a visa?  Is he a DACA kid?    Too many unknowns.
Lynn Knuth Pionke is there a document detailing Trumps plan? Or, is it to just ‚Äúbuild a wall?‚Äù,They don't seem to care about the safety of Americans. I have tried and tried to get a copy of the Democrats plan and the cost of it and can't find anything but political banter anywhere !
Steve Deshner When the Dems approved the wall for the same reasons Trump wants the wall how did they plan to pay for it!!? Maybe you ought to check out facts and you'll get a surprise if you didn't already know!! The Dems not only approved the wall they set aside money for it and spent just a little bit of it to put some wall there. They stole the rest of the money, where did they spend it, to other country's!!!!? Mexico paying or not no longer should be an issue, not just Trump but millions of Americans want the wall also.Those that don't just happen to be us that don't want to support something's you do. There is up to 2,000 more illegal Aliens heading our way, in groups of 500 !! Their not all coming from South America, some China and Muslim country's!! Yep shocker all going to the US southern border!!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Mark Warren How about talking to the Border Patrol, they are saying they need the wall!!!!,borders are defended
Mark Warren talk to the Border Patrol, their saying they really need the wall!! Their there every day not us or politicians!!!!,borders are defended
Well said!!,Democrats turning their backs on their own constituents, the poor, the working class...... Well the American ones.  Only a Democrat would stick their neck out for everyone but Americans.  Those already here who need government assistance in any form should be opposed to open borders. They will be bankrupting the very programs they depend on and stealing your children‚Äôs seats in the classroom.
Not new. Clinton did 17,Obama 13. Where were you,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
GOD BLESS YOU!,GOD BLESS YOU!
Beverly Hurst Smith you know you really should know your history and how Congress and the Senate works we did not have the votes in the Senate hello are you there is anybody home in that head of yours,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Denise Foot You get your words from mainstream media. It couldn't be more obvious. Who are your experts?  "vanity wall?" And please tell us what is the "plan" for border security?  The politicians you trust so much have created the situation at that border and they don't wish to fix it!  Don't be so na√Øve.,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Denise Foot Those aren't lies.  You don't get out much or know many people?  Immigration has been a problem for decades. Illegal migration is created by politicians and always has been. It's a huge problem.   All that California governor is going to have is slave labor and wealthy people and an overpopulation of poor people.  Ever see the homeless situation in southern California?,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Denise Foot I'm not wallowing in lies from anyone. YOu are na√Øve. I know exactly what's been going on in California for decades. I don't need anyone to tell me that.  I don't have to "read" anything about what I said either.  The previous governor Jerry Brown and the new one, Gaven Newsom do nothing but ruin California and if you can't see that , then maybe you should go there and learn a few things.  I don't need Donald Trump or anyone else but the people who actually live it in that state to tell me what those stupid politicians have allowed for over 30 years. My statements are true. YOU are na√Øve.  And don't call me a fool when you obviously know much of nothing about the situation in California. Take a trip and get outside of your own comfort zone, lady. Try learning real things and talk to real people.  YOur term "vanity wall" is a media term.  Don't you have your own words?,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Denise Foot They did fund the wall last year, dear.  They are using that money right now by repairing and replacing parts of the 700 miles of  wall / fencing that is already there.  They ALL voted for it not so long ago. YOu should keep up on current events.,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
It's called "objectivity."  "Rational and critical thought.",Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Denise Foot Laughing at the facts? I see you are just ignorant. Good luck with that.  Have you ever been to California or Texas?,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Denise Foot I didn't go only by what Trump said. Can't you research anything? You just laugh at everything instead.  There's 700 miles of border wall/fence already there!  Are you totally ignorant or what?  They have been repairing sections and replacing some too. Nancy Pelosi said it when she tried to deny it!  She said...."no new wall is being built, they are repairing sections of what's there and replacing some."   REPLACING some!  You are out of touch and think that laughing at things is rational.,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Too few understand and are unaware that the left is destabilizing the country for overthrow and subversion. Just today, rising democrat 'star" Beto O'Rourke stated that the US Constitution is an outdated document that should be replaced, and Elizabeth Warren said that the electoral college should be destroyed and replaced by mob rule (aka democracy). In 1958 an FBI agent wrote a book called 'The Naked Communist'. In this book he listed 45 communist goals for overthrowing the United States. One of the rules was: "Instill the idea that the US Constitution is outdated and a product of it's time". This was written 60 years ago. This is why the left is trying to disarm patriots. Too few are understanding the big picture. The left is dismantling the USA and it will be replaced by a communist dictatorship.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...
Randy Johnson The uneducated garbage is really old. Evidently you don't know many educated people. There are plenty who support him because they don't like the thought of communism.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...

Brent Robinson First off, Trumps approval rating is of his own making. Secondly everything in your post is right from the Republican Party playbook.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down.

We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

How so, President Trump won the election according to the rules of the US Constitution.  He is delivering on his campaign promises as few president have done before him in spite of a coordinated and constant attack on him by the establishment in the DC government, the News media and the Entertainment Industry.  20 years from now he will be remembered as an effective president after all of the current rancor is forgotten.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off.

To tell the whole truth, the 1.4 million you mention, 98% are from cop self defense, suicide and good Samaritans saving theirs and others lives. Yep, 2% are all that can be called problem killings by criminals. Ask how many gun deaths France and Britain have. It 8lis far higher because only bad guys have guns.   The bottom line is you do not trust your fellow Americans to have the same power as everyone else. U want to disarm us, so you can control us. This is not your fault.

Blanca Gonzalez very sorry ma'am! God Bless you and yours.,An illegal killed my dad years ago..
Attached is a link to official Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) statistics on border apprehensions for our Northern, coastal, and Southern borders for FY 2000 - 2017. Total apprehensions in FY 2017 were approx 20% of what they were in FY 2000. However, our current president says the stats HE HAS from CBP indicates an increase: https://www.cbp.gov/,And young white American citizens cause a thousand times more destruction. Besides, there was no intention in your brothers death, it was an accident. I am sorry for your loss, but blanket statements that equate an isolated incident to mass murder is ludicrous. Immigrants are not killing us, our own citizens are.

Yes and just like Trump Mortgage, Trump University, Trump Casinos he is rapidly bankrupting America too. Some businessman.,Where is he bankrupting us. just because he wants to spend and make thing right. look at the debt Obama left us.

Looks like America will be hiring mexican( qualified) workers for air traffic control jobs at half price. This might trouble retired controllers because pensions will be in jeopardy because future employees will not be paying in for retirement. LOL,John Fortney funny. Some of the young Controllers in training or newly certified are worried about missing a pay check. The whole damn thing is a shitshow, but that's nothing new, is it.   If it is truly a Emergency then Trump should declare or be derelict in his duties. Other than that it's a desperate act of a desperate man.
Steve Swisher my point was it could be worse. I understand when people work for or under the government it kidda dictates their thought process.

what the Dem abortions,How many children have been killed by Americans?
Yes the problem is bigger than the Illegals,  1 big bite will be a start.,So let me get this straight.....  Only Mexicans are in our prison system for murdering?  Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.  So y‚Äôall only care about people killed by Mexicans and not by Americans?   Again, please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.  But guess what...  I KNOW BETTER.

Additionally I have also sent a message to Nancy Pelosi telling her to put an end to this mess and compromise with you for the wall.  But then again no one is actually gonna listen on their end.  I don‚Äôt claim to know all the answers but I do know that we must end the government shutdown now and I know that the Democrats must compromise with you and make a deal.  Instead the Democrats are just dividing America further.,I deeply respect you Mr. President and everything you‚Äôre doing to keep America safe and deal with the border crisis and thank you for everything you have done for us combat veterans.  I sincerely appreciate everything you‚Äôve done I really do.    But please end the government shutdown there are people suffering because of it, there are government employees who have families who can‚Äôt even afford to buy groceries because of the government shutdown and all of the partisan bickering.  Not to mention the rest of the damage being done to the country because of this government shutdown.  Although since Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the Democrats refuse to compromise and deal with you they are just as responsible for this government shutdown now if not more responsible for the government shutdown because they will not compromise.    You have a lot of us who are behind you and support you including myself but please don‚Äôt let Nancy Pelosi and Schumer use this shutdown against you.  Please put an end to the government shutdown for the greater good of the country and maybe give the Democrats something they want most to get them to compromise on this and so you can get funding for the wall.  I don‚Äôt know I honestly don‚Äôt have all the answers and right now the government is in crisis it‚Äôs really a sever catch 22 right now.  All I can say for sure is that this government shutdown must end.    I‚Äôve never seen America so divided before and it honestly makes me sad to see my country that I love so much so divided.  We need to unite America again somehow.    God bless you Mr. President we are behind you we support you but please find a way to reopen the government before further damage is done.  I wish you well and I wish your Presidency to be successful sir, God bless you and God bless America!

Danny, the perp you cite is unfortunately one of us and we are left to deal with these kinds of things as a community through legal channels. The perp who took this man‚Äôs daughter should never have been here and, given serious, intellectually honest and bipartisan action to secure our border bring sanity back to our immigration enforcement process, likely would not have removed her from our midst.   Sorry for your loss.,Another American killed my friend. Is her death any less important than an illegal killing another American?
Jason McElweenie Works for me!,There is no doubt that Pelosi will reject the President's latest offer. That being the case I would:   Immediately proclaim a national crisis and get the military building barriers.  Secondly, I would let ICE loose. By that I would have them raid thousands of businesses and immediately deport any illegals found. As a nice measure I would give a 1 week notice that these raids are about to begin. Thirdly, along with deportation I would arrest either the hiring HR director, or if no one fits that description, arrest the front line supervision for hiring illegals.   Lastly, I would implement a 25% fee on ANY monies wired to Mexico and Central America.   If the President would implement a get tough program I would guess Pelosi would come begging to finally get this immigration issue solved once and for all. This crap needs to end.

That's what you are seeing now, and honestly I don't really seeing anyone sneaking into Mexico or Venezuela or an other south american country unless they are trying to hide. Every country has its own killers, child molesters that are probably allowed to do it because child marriage is still legal some areas, and all that etc..etc..etc. is available anywhere. Maybe a wall will or will not have an impact, but we won't know till we try. I mean it works for most countries,Your an ignorant man, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you build a wall.  It will not stop American Born serial killers, drug dealers/users, rapist, murderers, bigots, child molesters, etc., etc., from being in this country.

thanks for posting a book,John Scott  I'm telling my story to educate the American people and President Trump. This only touches the iceberg. The wall has to be built to protect Americans.
The way Obama got Obama care was by lying his ass off an having the dumbocrats ram it down out throats,  "We have to pass it to know what's in it" says Pelosi.  That's the way he got Obamacare you dumb ass.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Would it only be illegal immigrants that would ransack his house? because no Americans would ever commit a crime üôÑ moron,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Does God not like Mexico then? Is he only helping America?,No one but this great man could withstand the abuse and the lack of support and still accomplish the unthinkable. You‚Äôre a warrior, sir.

Debbie Hudson Debbie, first of all, open the government to stop hurting Americans by holding them hostage.  Then, analyze the border to identify the various issues associated with various segments of the border. Take the segments or issues presenting the greatest risk. Review those segments or issues to ID the best solution approaches. Fund those solution approaches. Then iterate thru lower priorities until the pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  There are big problems that a wall will do nothing to solve: 1) most of the illegal drugs that enter our great country across the southern border come in on vehicles driving thru existing, managed and legal ports of entry, 2) the next most prevalent entry method is via tunnels under existing wall, 3) about 40% of folk currently in our country illegally came in with valid visas but overstayed those visas (these folk come from all over the world) and 4) it is reported that currently, the visa overstay issue is contributing higher volumes of people in country illegally than the volume of people crossing across the southern border.  Trump is actually hurting the cause of enhancing border security by using the false siren call of ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù. This is both dumb and counterproductive. If he wanted true progress, he would lead the process towards smart and effective enhancements in a prioritized way.  Debbie, I watched Trump state he would be happy and proud to shut it down. I watched Trump state he would own the shutdown, completely.  I watched this on live TV - no ‚Äúfake news‚Äù spin involved.  Trump had signaled he would sign the funding bills. McConnell had the Senate vote on the funding bills based upon that understanding.  That same night, extreme right wing media personalities criticized Trump. Trump caved to the criticism (so much for being strong).  Then the House added Trump‚Äôs money into their version of the bill and passed it.  Then the shutdown started.  Then, the new House passed the exact same funding bills that had just been passed, almost unanimously, three or so weeks before. Now, McConnell refuses to bring those same bills for a vote in the new Congress, enabling Trump.  Trump is acting IMMORALLY when he hurts over one million Americans as his sole ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù chip.,No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.   STOP hurting our own citizens - it is IMMORAL.
Nick Brown Nick, I am the author of these remarks thus I can copy and paste it to any simple-minded propaganda spin message posted by Trump.

Betsy Hammond We spend $150 billion per year on illegal immigrants welfare. Even if wall only stopped half of it, that's $75 billion per year that can go towards the things you speak of. Can you imagine how far that can go? WOW!!!! You're not just real bright are you?,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.

Jennifer Yvonne Croff then maybe a American drunk driver would hit her. What then,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.

If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another

Luis  Duron  you're another special kinda moron aren't you....lmao,Each member of Congress should NOT be paid their salary and also fined $2000.00 a day the government is in Shutdown
Mexico is paying for the wall. USMCA trade agreement. It's not enough to complete it. Unless you voted for Trump his campaign promises are of no concern to you. You're campaign promises are in Godzillary's book currently on sale in the bargin bin at barns and noble. Stop acting like Trump owes you anything. You wasted your vote on a 2 time loser.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
fake news better than no news,Ya my tax dollars going for a wall thats not going to stop them
Lenny Anders trump is trying to tote this "solution" as a cure to the problem america has with 67 billion a year in drugs or more coming over the border. He's trying to say it is going to slow illegal immigrants. It will not help. The wall in isreal did not help with terrorism it stopped regular people from crossing into their territory's. You know what did help, having America spend 38 billion on isreals military and other operations in the region. You sit there pretending you know why people stopped trying to bomb isreal its more likely because if you approach the fence and try to climb over you could be met with LETHAL force. If you intend on killing refugees and people seeking work in your country then maybe numbers will drop.,Haha most who supports the wall seem to be in late 50-60s with no actual understanding of how it works.
The real problem with people over staying their visa's are the people who say nothing if they know someone who is over staying their visa's.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?

What a joke, the guy cant make a simple point about his country losing it's identity without it turning into a race issue.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Rick Sooy His promise was that MEXICO would pay for it!,Josh your right, but this is no longer about money. The one side hates the other side and will do what ever is needed to destroy our POTUS. Like it or not he's our leader, he beat 16 Republicans and Hillary to get this position. Like it or not, Trump won.
Anyone gots facts?,How much does it cost tax payers for just one year to support the illegals we have now?
No one knows?,How much does it cost tax payers for just one year to support the illegals we have now?
thanks for info,How much does it cost tax payers for just one year to support the illegals we have now?
Anyone know about how much it costs to support illegals we have right now for a year?,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
Ruben Radar Rodriguez well said! Thank you for your sacrifice.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Its not just Trump keeping the government shut down. The democrats own this just as much as he does.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
It would. Americans are sick of the illegals, sick of the corruption, sick of seeing our war veterans treated like crap, sick of Obamacare, sick of the deception and lies of the Democrats, and if Congress doesn't want to do their job, then fire them and we'll handle it ourselves with our President,In my observations, President Trump, we aren't facing Democrats anymore. We are facing off against evil, itself.   There have been jokes circulating, that if you gave a public address stating that oxygen is good for us, they would all suffocate themselves to try and slander you.   I am starting to believe this, however, because all they do is try to stop you from protecting Americans and our country.   Here is what I suggest, if Congress will not fund the border wall, begin selling the bricks to us Americans. Design some kind of order form, and we will purchase the bricks.   I am willing to work OT, to buy as many of those bricks, as I can afford.   We the people stood behind you, to beat Hillary. You think we won't do it again, against a Democrat, cry-baby congress?

We had well guarded borders before the Trump Shutdown occurred. Thanks to Trump for leaving the borders unsecured and open. Now just about about anyone armed can pass through the gates at our airports. Remember how Osama bin laden got into the country and planned the attacks ok n 9/11?  May as well just reopen the government and put more armed security to work. Because right now we have open borders because of Trump.,No other country has open borders why should we

Kathy Bezner why don't you pay up and build one and quit telling everyone that a wall is needed. The Trump had three years to fund the wall with a Republican dominated H.O.R and Senate and he didn't do anything. Now all of a sudden we Liberals and Democrats are being blamed for no wall? Let me remind you that he promised Mexico would pay for it and he couldn't force Mexico to pay up. So NO WALL!!! WHATSOEVER!!!,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!

Lynn Limauro Floyd How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans let‚Äôs say in the last 10 years?,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Curtis Rice your a jerk,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.

And most were registered Democrats let that sink in.,Did you hear about Aurora illinois shooting yesterday asshole? Guess what, he was legal and with a felony and somehow he bought a gun.  How your stupid wall is going to solve that ?
I'm sorry for your loss,An illegal killed my dad years ago..
Hahaha MSM hahaha,Trump lies for example in the sotu he said one out of three women in the caravans are molested.    The mainstream media looked into it and found trump lied.     Only 31 percent of women in the caravans were found to be molested!  Impeach trump and lock him up!
Gary Kane , you must not have watched yesterday.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Yes we have enough crazy here in the US, don't need to import more garbage.,In Chicago every 14 mins somebody is getting shot. The man who created the massacre in Las Vegas? All these shooters are "legal Americans"
Temicka Brown no your democrat plantation doesn't care about you, try and keep up.,So what makes you think a damn wall will keep out illegals?
Stupid,If you‚Äôre going to build a wall on the border with Mexico, wouldn‚Äôt you also build walls on both coasts and our border with Canada? And if you do that, wouldn‚Äôt make sense just to isolate ourselves from the world, cease all trade and just curl up into a ball and ignore the realities of life? LOL at the WALL. #SmokeAndMirrors
Donald J. Trump,Please stop the goverment shutdown i need things from the irs to start school i have to start feb 25th if they dont open by then i wont be able to start school.
Kris Landers sorry the wall will prevent further loss of funds why do they want to come here Free healthcare , jobs schools oh and don‚Äôt forget birth right citizenship are all opportunity that should be for green card holders and sponsored workers etc .,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

James McCaskill there‚Äôs a lock on my house, but if someone wanted to get in, they could. The border is no different. I don‚Äôt have a fence around my house. One isn‚Äôt needed because if someone wanted to come over it to break into my house, they would. The fence wouldn‚Äôt stop them, but I‚Äôd be out a lot of money. See the similarities?  The only way to keep out intruders would be with other methods, like a watchdog or obvious cameras. The point is, there are more effective methods.,Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets. But if you listen to mainstream media or the Democrats nothing wrong with our borders.
they both looked like something from a horror movie with their creepy eyes!,Notice how Schumer looks us in the eyes, but did not look the president in the eyes in the meeting a few weeks ago! And Shcumer lies, so does Pelosi! Happy that you mentioned that many congressional and Hollywood types have walls around their homes Keep the shut down, build the wall!

Smith Helen Jessica if you let a Russian in the voting booth with you that is your stupidity. The American citizens voted for Donald Trump.  No Russians were in the booth with them. Live in your fairytale Russian collusion that they put Trump into office.  The only ties to Russia is the fake dossier paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign, which was used to open an investigation. I do not give a crap about anything Manafort did.  The citizens of the United States voted but the democrats cannot accept the election of Donald Trump.,June Norrell who me?

I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Norene Boone  all well and good when we had people in the Government willing to do there job . It‚Äôs not his wall it‚Äôs the people‚Äôs wall digbat,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Natalie Halem pay attention mam... The Democrats are not going to give OUR PRESIDENT ANY SUPPORT ...THAT'S RIGHT HE IS YOUR PRESIDENT TOO!!!,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage
Anthony Conrod LoL I‚Äôve been called a bot or Russian so many times I‚Äôve lost count. Everyone is a bot or Russian when they don‚Äôt like what you have to say. And CNN will flat out block comments.

But you aren‚Äôt doing that are you? No. What you care about is stopping brownish colored people from entering the country because you‚Äôre a xenophobic asshole.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp!

Carol Chisumvii per the Politico poll, 44% support the wall. Per the Reuters poll, 41% support the wall. Per the Hill poll, 34% support the wall.  Now, I hate polls. They often have flawed methodology and can be misleading. That being said, they are probably a more reliable source than your ass, which is where you pulled that "74%" number from...  To be fair if you meant to comment that 74% of "Republican voters" or 74% of "Trump voters" support the wall - I believe you, and if you edit your comment to include that qualifier, I will delete this criticism.

Micheal Marceaux that's why I used the qualifier "most".

The China wall protected to some degree of crawling of enemies anyway. I was in London in the 60 s. When I visited UK in 2002, I see there was no road rules. It is like honkers flying. Every week there is a protest march. Why cannot humans live like humans. The cleanliness and the integrity of the British man is gone. Please give your solution and do not argue. Should be positive comments.,Yes must be a border wall. There is a reason for China building the great wall of China. How about the wall in Germany after the second WW. There must be a wall on the Mexican border to protect worms crawling into USA. Mexicans have there own standard of living and behaviour.

Police in Aurora, Illinois, have released the names of the five Henry Pratt Co. employees who were killed in Friday's shooting: ‚Ä¢ Clayton Parks of Elgin, Illinois. He was a human resources manager. ‚Ä¢ Trevor Wehner of DeKalb, Illinois. He was a human resources intern and a student at Northern Illinois University  ‚Ä¢ Russell Beyer of Yorkville, Illinois. He was a mold operator. ‚Ä¢ Vicente Juarez of Oswego, Illinois. He was a stock room attendant and fork lift operator. ‚Ä¢ Josh Pinkard of Oswego, Illinois. He was a plant manager.  Related Article: These are the victims of the mass shooting in Aurora, Illinois The gunman, Gary Martin, 45, shot several of the men at a meeting during which he was being fired, Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said Saturday. At least one of the slain men was found on another level in the building, she said. Martin was not supposed to own a gun because of a 1995 aggravated assault conviction in Mississippi, she said. But he obtained one in Illinois in 2014. In January of that year, he applied for a firearms owner identification card, she said. In March 2014, he applied to buy a gun from a dealer in Aurora. After a waiting period and passing a background check that did not involve fingerprinting, he bought the gun, she said. Later that month, he applied for a concealed carry permit, and a fingerprint check led authorities to discover the Mississippi conviction, Ziman said. The permit was rejected, and Illinois State Police sent him a letter demanding he voluntarily surrender the weapon, but he did not, the chief said. Investigators are trying to determine why he didn't surrender the weapon and whether law enforcement followed up with him to confiscate the gun. "He was not supposed to be in possession of a firearm," Ziman said.,A man just slaughtered 5 innocent people in Illinois. He was angry American male... AGAIN

Today, about 55,000 criminal aliens account for more than one-fourth of prisoners in Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities, and there are about 297,000 criminal aliens incarcerated in state and local prisons.

And miles of NO fences, where evil people can sneak in. I've watched the documentation's of it. You need to get more informed about this subject.,Karen Harvey  ok Republican
Zavala---BS! The democrat's walked away & wouldn't talk about it. Pelosi even insulted our Sec. of Homeland Security & told her, she didn't believe the facts she put out. Trump stayed at the WH during Christmas & New Year, to work on this but Pelosi went to Hawaii to vacation. The House passed the bill in Dec & now Schumer & the dem's own the shutdown!,Karen Harvey you forgot the part where the president said he owned it!  In fact he said he was Proud to own it!
Huber---You are just incapable or don't want to understand the savings from Trump's new trade deals with Mexico, where we were losing billions every year. He never said Mexico would be sending a check!! The savings from those trade deals will be paying off the wall many times over in the years to come. It's that simple!,So we will save $12B in trade from Mexico in just this year? I don't think so.
Chenier--This is just one case out of thousands every year. The liberal democrat media refuses to report on them, because it doesn't help their agenda for open border's. The point is, that these illegal's weren't suppose to be here & each case would have been one "less case" of a family losing a loved one to murder, or a killing by a drunk driving illegal.,Sad to see this man has lost his lovely daughter. However, this is still not a national emergency.
Jerry Robinson ---Communist published Time? Man, have you been indoctrinated, sad one.,Lannette Syck Yeah, don't believe facts dug up by thousands of journalists! Trump gullibles must only believe him, the great white nationalist liar -- a politician who have a general believability index of one notch above used-car salesmen. See no truth. Hear no truth. Speak no truth. Good luck!
Robinson---You have a terrible comprehension problem, with no common sense to boot. Your post is BS!,Lannette Syck Yeah, don't believe facts dug up by thousands of journalists! Trump gullibles must only believe him, the great white nationalist liar -- a politician who have a general believability index of one notch above used-car salesmen. See no truth. Hear no truth. Speak no truth. Good luck!
Butkowsky--BS!  He wasn't suppose to be here & her daughter would still be alive, along with hundreds every year from D-Driving & deliberate murder's by illegal's, if Obama's "Catch & Release Act" was ended & the border was secured by the barrier, technology & more agents.,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Decker---That's total BS!,From your statement it would seem that you are not one of the intelligent ones, right?
Matthew Kentner --APRIL??? Try polling them tomorrow.,Patton---Yeah and that electrical grid can be tampered with by terrorist's sneaking in through unsecured border miles!!! Use your brain!
Lamphier--What is it that you want them to get??,And the victims of Orlando, Las Vegas, & Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, what do they get? Oh yes, thoughts and prayers aka absolutely nothing.
Kris Knight----They're not funny in the least!,You could ask for 5 billion for cancer research Mr. President and they would appose it.    üñï them puppets. Build the wall off the 800 thousand checks your not mailing out. Keep it shut down!!
Wagner---Because guess what?....The democrat's have to vote on that too!,Why not just make it a condition of providing Mexico the $5.8 Billion in foreign aid that they use it to build the wall?
Morris---A Mexican name? It's our wall. It should say "Welcome To America" Please come in legally.,If you give the wall a name so that it won‚Äôt be the Trump wall the Democrats will bend they don‚Äôt want a monument named after you give it a Mexican name who cares just don‚Äôt call it the Trump wall
Kentner---BS!,Tim Gilbert spoken like the the sheepeople you must be. Way to sit up and pay attention like a good little boy. You would do well being a citizen of North Korea. I‚Äôm not screaming...just making fun of the folks like yourself that lack the ability to think critically or at all.... in many cases. It‚Äôs ok your parents didn‚Äôt teach you to think. Shouldn‚Äôt you be consuming blindly or shopping at Walmart? At least you can hunt.
Rodriguez---Thank you & God Bless you & your wife.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Hammer---Yeah, finally giving them some truth!!!!,Sean Patrick McCarthy
Harrah---BS! The House passed it big time. It was the Senate that didn't because of the stupid 60 vote rule!,I did not say that.  The repubs had the chance.  Now are balking.  trump is a fool and traitor.
Patton---Yeah and that electrical grid can be tampered with by terrorist's sneaking in through unsecured border miles!!! Use your brain!,illegal crossing is down to lowest levels in years
He tweeted last month the "border is secure"   why did he send the military home? Why has used only 6% of what the Congress gave him last year?  You know he can't just put up a wall on private land right? It will take decades in court...You know all this right?  trump supporter logic= No Logic,John Baron the pay is indirect- and he has kept more campaign promises than any other politician in my lifetime
Dan, It's B.O.R.D.E.R   Trump ball licker Crack me up.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
I say wait for the checks to come in from Mexico.ü§î,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.

So our nation should be like a prison?,Matthew Cloward ya I guess prison wall are just for looks  ‚Ä¶ ya right
And ironically, it was only a promise because his campaign staff considered him too scatterbrained to remember his immigration talking points, so they gave him a one syllable word he could use.  It was only when the crowd cheered that he decided to make it a campaign feature and a promise.,You noticed
ROFL.  The ACA was a compromise, and included 140+ GOP amendments and changes.,No more DACA, Build the damn wall! No more Amnesty! Build the Wall!
That ship has already sailed for Donnie.,Jocke Stangebye  I never pictured Stanley as a wanker...but now that you mention it...
Karen Harvey Ah, so sad about the 60 needed votes. Where are Trump's much vaunted negotiating and deal making skills? Didn't he campaign on being the best deal maker in the history the world?  And speaking of obstructionist: The Senate passed the VERY SAME BILL the Democrats just passed in the House to reopen the government -- passed it by 90 to 10, a bipartisan vote. But oh, that was before the new House came in. Now Mitch McConnell won't even put THAT SAME BILL to a Senate vote.,Patton---Yeah and that electrical grid can be tampered with by terrorist's sneaking in through unsecured border miles!!! Use your brain!
Karen Harvey Trump said he would never sign it. This was after claiming he would sign any bipartisan legislation that came across his desk.,Patton---Yeah and that electrical grid can be tampered with by terrorist's sneaking in through unsecured border miles!!! Use your brain!
Tess Calomino There were actually more votes for Democratic Senator candidates than for GOP.  Go ahead and check; it's public record.  GOP gained seats due to gerrymandering.,Tim Gilbert . No crying here. Im satisfied with the results.
Howard Bushart that's funny s*** right there do you have any family I have to stand there to protect that wall and you know what's really going on at that wall since you live down there or do you believe what you see on CNN,No wall for you.  But be of good cheer, no one with half a mind expected you to keep your word or tell the truth.
Cheryl Bowler Schrager  Stupid,WALLS DO NOT WORK.  Stop using victims as props!
Charlie Daboub you do realize it took 10 Democrats from the Senate to pass any Bill that included money for the Wall. The Democrats refused to work with the Republican Senators, not counting the several RINOS in the Republican Party who also refused to vote for the Wall. I have never understood why the RINOS are even in the Republican Party other than to help the Democrats block real Conservative Bills. These are some of the reasons why the Wall was not built in the last two years.,President Trump please keep standing strong against these anti-American, Globalists, Open Borders people! "We The People" want you to build the Wall for our protection! Thank you and God bless you, Sir!üíñ
States will never be unified when we are talking about two different parties, but what we are talking about is common sense, the barrier needs built and laws changed. Not because they don't like this president.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
They don't care about our security, all they care about is obstruction...and that obstruction isn't just against Trump...it's against ALL OF US who voted for him!  They are NOT representing the people!  They are doing their OWN WILL, against the American people, who put Trump in office by an overwhelming majority!  The ILLEGITIMATE HOUSE we have now, by voter corruption and FRAUD will feel our wrath in 2020.,The Democrats are opposing the President ONLY BECAUSE they are just about obstruction!!!  THEY KNOW the Border needs a wall and security...see below:  https://www.facebook.com/redpillusa/videos/223178005279698/The Caucasian ManDemocrats: ‚ÄúShiiiiiiiiieeeet‚ÄùPlay Video
Grateful that our president is protecting us.  God Bless you in your upward battle.,Grateful that our president is protecting us.  God Bless you in your upward battle.
Amy Perry Jenson yes, exactly what Obama did to get his way. Great teaching by example.,What‚Äôs more important a Wall or People being able to provide for their families!! Time for Congress to change the laws on Shutting down the Government!! The Government should never ever be able to shut down without the votes coming from the house and the senate approval!! This needs to soon be enforced because every-time U cannot have your way this is exactly what U will do!! RESIGN
Bobby Wilson they will get back pay. Meanwhile I would like to get my community back, so I want border security.,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Charissa Rausch I wish you could experience what we deal with in border states and perhaps understand. Additional fencing along with increased personnel and technology is needed to slow the tide. Three of my family members have personally suffered from the doings of illegals committing criminal acts. Our school is bilingual and challenged by the transient attendance. Our neighborhoods have transmitted to third world country appearance and operation. Without a slowdown, there is no way for absorption and assimilation to work. You may not feel it yet in Idaho, but it won't take long at this pace.,I am not in favor of constructing a border wall, but you aren't interested in my opinion or representing me as an American. You only seem interested in representing your "base." Weren't you elected to represent ALL the people?
Donna Snyder please contact your area uso and American legions,Stand firm sir. I do wish something could be done for the coast guard service personnel! They have no union benefits
Leif Menzie lucky to live in America where there is help. Time to make sure we can keep it that way!,Yeah I think the people going to food banks right now for food would disagree with you.

Diane Ruckdeschel the Democrats could fix it all and "save the daca kids" in ONE VOTE....let's wait and see what they do...they don't care about the daca kids or the federal employees...they only care about votes....they voted for the wall in 2006 (Obama, shumer and Hillary Clinton, they only are opposing now because they hate Trump. They change their policies as often as they change their underwear.wake up people...they don't care about you....if they did they would make policies that didn't keep people stuck on food stamps and welfare. They WANT YOU DEPENDAND ON ON THEM!,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
The law today is still the law TODAY.  I don't care - they are not criminals, terrorists and can SUPPORT THEMSELVES. We need to look at the other side of the coin and realize what is actually coming into this country.  I say NO MORE REFUGEES as well.  Criminalize stepping across this our border if not at a port of entry, and start keeping statistics of those in our prisons that are illegals as well.  Keeping data on just how much these freeloaders are costing us in 'BORROWED' tax funds is essential.  It's our money - we need to see where it goes.,We MUST get to the root cause - our STUPID asylum laws!  You nailed it with that, the Visa Lottery and chain migration  STOP THE MADNESS!  Get to the ROOT CAUSE or we will continue to spin on this hamster wheel!
Build the wall!!!!! Do you really want all your taxes to pay for caring for the illegals instead of American's?,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don‚Äôt support it. Don‚Äôt say we.
Ralph Harris uh no!!!  I just know lies when I hear them! Good...how much of a check are you willing to write out toward the wall? I bet not much! Lol,Ralph Harris uh no!!!

Brent Robinson, you've just described the GOP. Lol! Except...where in hell did you find a poll that suggests The Moron has a high approval rating? More than 50% disapprove at this point. He's losing his baseless base bigly.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Also, if you literally  can't afford the fine, or the premiums you file this form with your taxes...and you're exempt.....the fine is much less costly than the premiums for the cheapest insurance you  can buy....but...here is the link: .https://marketplace.cms.gov/applications-and-forms/hardship-exemption.pdf,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Jessica Cecilia Motley, The aca helps more people afford medical care... period... protecting you and myself from preexisting conditions and a host of other things...the fact is, the individual state governments decide whether or not they participate fully....i.e, Alabama doesn't expand Medicaid, therefore making the pool of insured people much smaller...less people in the pool means less distribution of costs which causes prices to go up . insurance companies pull up roots and leave the market place and go to stated where there's some competition....blue Cross is the only available insurance company in our market place for people under 65.   ...so they ( blue Cross blue shield) have Monopoly over the insurance market....  They don't have any reason to be competitive with pricing ........the governments don't mind because we are paying 20 times for their gold insurance than the cost of  Medicaid expansion..they'd receive grant funding for expanding Medicaid...but since they choose to not participate, the cost comes back to us...sir, ma'am taxpayer. Now...what makes more sense? Get grant funding to pay for Medicaid for the folks who need it ..or just not doing it at all and paying extra for healthcare premiums???,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Roy Meston other Presidents have had govt shutdowns. Do your history.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Trump is making America a third world country. He is dividing and mail g America hate everyone,is going a good job of making us a nation
Dave Callender well if we can cancel out the law of people coming in legally these we can get rid of every law and be a lawless country ! Fine by me but will you be ok with it Santa Claus when a criminal is at your door ? I‚Äôm guessing no you smart ass,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Beverly Hurst Smith thank you President Trump for all you've done & still doing for our country!!!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Duval Sotelo hate to break it to you, but the House was mostly Republicans until a few days ago!  The shutdown started in Dec 2018! The Democrats were sworn in to office January 2019! trump said he would take full credit for the shutdown, REMEMBER!  There is NO emergency!  Just trump responding to the conservatives talking heads and FOX Entertainment news! Why didn't he use his "fantastic negotiating skills" (at least that's what he calls them) to talk the few Democrats he needed into voting yes? Because the Republicans didn't want a wall and didn't negotiate in support of it!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Derek Crow-Brown WHY didn't trump ask for 5.1 Billion in his budget?  You know the one that he presented, asking for 1.5 billion,  that was passed and ready for him to sign?  So why did it becone an EMERGENCY after FOX and conservative Talking Heads said to NOT negotiate?  WHY  didn't trump pass the funding when he had both Houses and just needed a couple of votes?  WHY didn't the Republicans negotiate for trump with the few Democrats?  WHY after 2 years has he decided to ransom the American people for a Wall that is obsolete?,Nancy Pelosi wants to thank you for voting democrat in the last election. She and 30 of her democrat coworkers along with 100+ lobbyists were having a lovely time in Puerto Rican enjoying that balmy weather, attending the play Hamilton and partying with the cast in the evening, while regular Americans are struggling to make ends meet since giving 0.005% of the $3.8 trillion annual budget for the wall is just to expensive!
Mark Hack did he bring HIS and his families businesses to the USA?  NO, they are still in China and other Asian countries!  But don't worry NONE of them are on the Tariffs list!

They think they're making more money  , and money is all they care about!,thanks for saving the country
Mark Hack you're correct, FOX ENTERTAINMENT news has never retracted the "Pizzagate" story or "that Obama wasn't born in the USA" or "that Obama was coming for your guns" or "FEMA camps"!

Keith Webber Jr.  You are wrong ..you must be in Trump's 35% base,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Keith Webber Jr. Many National Emergencies were called prior to President Obama (why you all bring up Obama and Clinton all the time...get over them...focus on now)...but did Obama want to take money from the military or drug intervention programs? Trump himself ...in the Rose Garden... said..after he declared a National Emergency....he didn't need to do this now.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Tommy Carpenter How was he voted in illegally?  He won the Popular vote and Electoral College vote each time ...Trump lost the Popular vote...even with Putin's help,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....

Thankfully, I don't know anyone who has been harmed by an illegal but I am still for the wall. Walls are good. Walls help with many things. The people against to wall are - well, I won't put it in print - but one day it's going to affect them and we'll see how their opinion is then. So many people hate this president more than they love their country. God bless the friends and family affected and God bless our president and those trying to help.

You missed the entire point of my post, Janie. Congratulations.   By your logic, everyone who dies by firearm wouldn't be dead if those were banned. Does that mean that we should ban firearms? No, it does not. Does that mean we should politicize gun deaths for the sake of taking gun rights away? No.   Please understand the complete hypocrisy before commenting again.,Conservatives- DoNt PoLiTiCizE gUn DeAtHs, sTuPiD DeMs  Also Conservatives- Politicize deaths at the hands of illegal immigrants.   UPDATE- You are just as dead if you're killed by an illegal immigrant as you are by a legal citizen. Only difference is, more people are killed by legal citizens every year than illegals lol.

Military still getting paid,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that‚Äôs where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don‚Äôt see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.

"Dave Callender, we've got you covered because Ann had Allstate",10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Democrats like it when illegals kill Police officers and innocent civilians, Demtards have blood on their hands...,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Build that wall Mr President we support you,Nothing but a piece of propaganda

Joseph R Phipps first off he's not "my boy." I don't blindly support politicians like you Trumpers do. I criticized Obama plenty.  Russia is interfering in our elections as we speak. They have even hacked into our electrical grids ECT. So I don't know if Putin has a tape of Trump peeing on underage hookers or what. Russia is not our ally.

Obama did not have the longest job loss streak ever. You sound like Trump just spouting nonsense. Its pathetic.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.

Now he's costing us billions with his stupid distraction shut down. He's adding astronomical debt. Didn't he promise to eliminate the debt? Oh right...he's a liar.

Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
Defintely will go down in history as a corrupt traitor. A fluke!! His supporters will be remembered as a cult.,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
Elaine Campbell good luck with that 2020 thing. If he even makes it to that election.,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
Bill Harris I'm pretty sure both parties have been screwed up in many different ways over time. The Republicans are the mess right now. The Trumpers/Tea party have driven away Republicans in droves. So much that people I never thought would vote democrat are switching parties. Trump is the biggest mistake they ever made.,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Pelosi is doing great!! Exactly what she was elected to do.,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Anne Crossway I truly think he is enjoying this. He loves drama. That's what you get when you elect a reality show guy for president. Country's biggest mistake ever.,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Chase Blood Congress IS doing its job. We elected them for this!!! Its why we won the house. To put some checks on this psychopath running the country.,Just do an executive order and be done with it
It doesn't work like that. If it did wouldn't he have done that 2 years ago. Why hold the country hostage now out of the blue? My guess is he is mad the Dems took the house and scared to death of what Mueller has on him as he watches all of his associates go to prison. This is his big distraction and its failing BIGLY.,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Julie Williams what do you mean?,Nancy and her ilk need to swing by the neck.
Randall Hayes I want to answer you but its hard to understand your grammar.,Terry Hogan , you know what it is like to loose a child and I would never wish that on no one , tell me what would you tell the Angel Parents about you view that you feel we do not needing a wall ?
Yanira Blanco what have any of the four people you mentioned done to deserve prison time? The last time I checked a bunch of Trumps people were going to prison including his personal lawyer, campaign manager and national security advisor. Trump is under 17 investigations. But yes, lets put the elderly billionaire George Soros in jail- who by the way is a super generous billionaire that actually gives his money to charity unlike Trump who ran a fraudulent foundation.  What is your obsession with Soros anyway? I think you might be watching too much right wing propaganda.,Keep up the good work. We are rooting for you. Build the wall.
Because it doesn't.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another

Wendi DelValle so sorry about your brother üò¢,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
CM Garner  really cause trump was broke in the 2000‚Äôs and Putin bought condos off him for 12 times the worth and inbelzed money to Trump to the tune of 1/2 a billion dollars ~ he‚Äôs bailed him out not only once but twice ~ we have a Russian in the White House ~ even Nixon hated dictators and communist ~ Trumps a TrAitor ~ Putin‚Äôs puppet ~,Impeach this Russian owned traitor ~

Dee Dee Kelly Colvin its sad that there are SO many illegals here,BUILD THE WALL AND MAKE THEM GO THROUGH THE LEGAL CHANNELS TO COME TO THE US.

Jose Nieto somebody needs to quit watching fake news. The Russia fake is already over he's been cleared. Lets see what other dity deed they try. Most of us normal Americans want security.,You joke.

Joseph Roy Yes we should and we should do something about all the white guys with guns killing all of our women and children too dont you think? Yet we do NOTHING, heck the so called prez never has much to say about any of that does he, only focuses on mexicans day in and day out. So messed up!,I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
Same with all of us Americans who have lost family members to gun violence. Not one word ever said by Donny about that.,Kelly Preiss Wilhelm I never want to see anyone killed period. He does talk about it though.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs criminals which will always have guns ‚Äú. We could ban all guns in America.   The criminals would still have them.  Gun control only disarms the good ppl.  I‚Äôm so sorry you lost someone to this crime invested country.  And we all need to work together to push out the bad.  Not argue.  There‚Äôs a lot more good ppl than bad.  Ppl has to stand up to the thugs.  They‚Äôre out numbered by far.
Phoebe Cassandra Smith and even though I'm not a great Trump fan I think this politics as usual is a disgrace to this country. The Democrats can end the shutdown just as easily as the president can there's absolutely no doubt about that. and I'm not asking them to go against their own beliefs I'm just asking them to think about coming up with a compromise for something that they themselves have pushed over the past 10 years.,Wake up people. The wall between the left and the right in Washington DC is probably the most impermeable wall ever constructed it's not a physical wall but it's definitely an impermeable wall.
Marilyn didn't call anyone a name. Your case is pointless.,Why do the Trump cultists always call people names? Are they 5 years old?
Jackie McHugh Neither he nor his administration has submitted ANY form of legislation addressing the specifics for his vanity wall or a larger immigration reform plan.,Dan Rather: ‚ÄúHere's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security.  In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed.  That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent.  You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall.  You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work."

Anne Crossway agreed no only will it not work it will cause irreparable damage to the ecosystem, on top of blocking many people from vital water they need in an area with so little already,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
Next order of business, the constitution gives power to congress to make these decisions, if he just national emergency around this then who is to say any President after him wont do this and gain more and more power. Which is part if the issue now its become so normal for people to call the president the boss, but he is only the boss of one part of a three part government.,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
A national emergency needs to reviewed every year. It doesn't give you peoples land from imminent domain. Even if a border wall was approved you wouldn't see it.,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.

Carl Ostendarp better than New York where  you would killed them,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
You just saw the future,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels‚Äô hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy‚Äôs and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
Well said, Michael.,An illegal immigrant killed one of my friends, I don‚Äôt blame them all for it. That‚Äôs stupid. The choice of an individual doesn‚Äôt reflect all of them

Bull O'Neill The Military Doesn‚Äôt Seem to Appreciate Trump‚Äôs Border Stunt                                                                       President Trump‚Äôs decision to deploy thousands of active-duty soldiers to the border with Mexico, ostensibly to defend against an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù of asylum seekers from Central America, is such a transparent political stunt that even his fellow Republicans are dismayed ‚Äî if only because they think it‚Äôs a less effective midterms strategy than focusing on the midterms. As it turns out, another group you might generally expect to support the president is also less than thrilled with his order: namely, the military itself.  Responding to criticism of the dubious deployment last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis demurred: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do stunts in this department.‚Äù The soldiers being sent to the border are there to provide support to the Department of Homeland Security, just as they often do after natural disasters, Mattis insisted. The secretary did not speak to the question of whether a dwindling caravan of around 3,000 Central American asylum seekers, currently 800 miles from the border and traveling on foot, really merited the same emergency response as a hurricane.  Since then, several reports have come out showing that Trump‚Äôs original vision for the deployment, tendentiously titled Operation Faithful Patriot, was larger in scope than what the Pentagon ultimately allowed, as some of what the president expected the soldiers to do was at best wasteful and at worst illegal. The administration‚Äôs first request, CNN reported on Friday, was for soldiers to provide ‚Äúcrowd and traffic control‚Äù and protect Customs and Border Protection personnel, which some Defense officials viewed as law enforcement activities the military is barred by law from performing. That request was rejected, as was a proposal that soldiers construct housing for detained migrants, according to Reuters.,The Wall is a figment and an fixation of Trump's sick twisted narcissistic mind!

You can't drive vehicles through tunnels. Also tunnels cost the cartels a ton of time, money, and resources. Most importantly it slows them down.,Mr President have you heard of Tunnels.
Walls, fence whatever you call it slow people down allowing us to get there and catch them. Also stops drive vehicles from just driving through in places like AZ. Also need the Congress to change laws to stop the flow of people so we can focus on the bad guys.,Marjorie Anderson and the answer is??????????

Sharon Fantana there is no big tech equipment that is going to physically stop a vehicle from driving over the border in a place like Arizona. Also if they have to build tunnels to traffic this takes time and resources of the cartels. We've been building barriers under the last several presidents. The fact is some people just dont like Trump and use it as an excuse to oppose him but that does not change the fact of what works down here and unless you have been out in the field chasing this stuff you really can't understand how much it slows them down for us to get to these places especially the more remote ones.  As far as Mexico paying for it. Like I said we've been building barriers and paying for it under the last several presidents. Now I have not read the full new deal that replaced  NAFTA but from what I've seen, been told, and understand is that we're getting a huge swing of money our way essentially paying for the wall. He never said they were going to dish out cash. There are other ways to make them pay. IR tariffs, new deals in our favor etc. People tend to be too narrow minded to think about those things because the mainstream media just pushes what they want. That's why it's more important then ever to do your own research and find the facts not just what they want to tell you.,Marjorie Anderson and the answer is??????????

It has been 30 days or more since many of these government employees have been paid and many are required to work without pay.  That means paying for gas to go back and forth to work.  They are being held hostage in a political battle not of their making.  Many of these government employees work to secure our border, now without pay.  Please end this shutdown.  I support you on a strong border, but this is hurting our fellow Americans.
Morpheus three words for you idiot. WORLD WIDE WEB,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Dylan Clymore yes! 4 walls to be exact, but one wall might be made with vertical steel bars.,The wall will fix drinking and driving?.........
walls work. Stop being petty or take your doors off and let everyone in your house. Hahahaha,The wall will fix drinking and driving?.........
Brent Robinson those minority parties are so powerful!!!!!  So much for his being strong, effective, a winner.  Looks like he's a whining loser from this vantage.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Marcus Rech MS13 is an AMERICAN gang, fyi.,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Lynn Limauro Floyd what does the wall have to do with it?,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Paul Pietrantonio gimme a break.  He's a lying charlatan and you're defending him.,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!
Susan Dawn McGuire no, that one will go to the idiot who took PRIDE in not paying people.,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them. We see this in the recent drama from Buzzfeed. Absolutely amazing the reaction they had before they knew the truth and now after they know the truth. It‚Äôs a COMPLETE MELT DOWN.  WHAT A F‚Äî‚ÄîD up way to live!!!
It is meant to keep all illegals out, come in the right way, their are laws in place, look up illegal, if you don't know the difference.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Joanne Christie, i know for a fact when i have watched the president give a speach, and the next day cnn turns around what he says, to be a bought off democratic network. Use your eyes and ears, not some b.s. facts check the democrats have put in place...,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Cam go look in the mirror, you know nothing of what your speaking of. If it cost 5.6 billion dollars to build the wall, and it cost more than that to the taxpayers in one year to allow them to come in. You can't build half a wall, idiot, then police the other half. I hope for people like you, an illegal rapes or kills someone you love, maybe they will escape back to Mexico like the man who killed my nephew's friend. You democrats and liberals needed your asses whipped, go see if you can sneak into another country, and what theyed do to you if you got caught. If we'd allow everyone to come here and help them, we'd all have to work 24 hrs. a day to support all the freebies your political party keeps handing out. People like you amaze me at the lack of brains you have...,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Sorry Cam,these messages are meant for Arev Neerg.,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
As a people you have to rise up and take your country back. Or it will never be the country you once knew. Stay strong...,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Sharon Fantana why don't you ask Israel who had a ton of enemies?,Marjorie Anderson and the answer is?????????? Can YOU answer the question instead of acting like your cool aid master üòä
It's ok if you don't understand politics just don't spew your stupidity around,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Well, that's nice and dandy, but the original text was not written in English but Greek and most likely referred to a Shofar. These were also blown when the walls of Jericho fell. The passage you quoted is talking about the resurrection, not a wall in the US.  National pride is the beginning of Babylon. That is coming from someone who lives in Germany. ;),let me know when you see it...... 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 King James Version (KJV)  51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  King James Version (KJV)
Gregory Baxter Are you suggesting men aren't killed by the guns in America?,How about all the daughters killed by Americans with guns, people that shouldn't have guns, what about that moeron?
Lisa Mann Not if you have military patrols on top of the wall complete with towers, gun turrets & fully equipped resource centers that the troops/ICE can use.  Israel's border wall does it's job quite well, I haven't lost a friend to a suicide bombing in over 10 years.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Curtis Rice that‚Äôs not how statistics work,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
We can come up with horrific stories about any group of people, and it will make them look bad by focusing just on them. Imagine reading posts about what white people have done to other people, u would want them out of the country as well.,Horrific stories and I cant believe most think there is no emergency.  There certainly IS.

Oh yes, thoughts and prayers aka absolutely nothing.
Omar Martinez - Can you cite one?,I get all my news from Kremlin State TV, Rump‚Äôs Real News, Alex Jones, Fox and Friends, and The National Enquirer. Good to know I'm well informed.  So I know that if you want to buy a box of cereal, you have to have a voter ID and that Donald gave our soldiers a 10% pay raise. Mexican drug smugglers throw sacks of drugs over the fence and our people get hit on the head with 60 pounds of stuff.  I know the deep state has access to weather weapons capable of not only creating tornadoes but also moving them around, on demand.  I know that the government is using chemicals in order to turn people gay, using a mysterious "gay bomb" devised by the Pentagon.

Allow all illegals in, provide them with a ‚ÄúWelcome aboard package‚Äù which includes the immediate right to vote along with  affordable housing but they must agree in writing to register as Republicans/Conservatives then see how quickly Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the Resistance Party coughs up the $5 billion ü§î

Every single thing below is verifiable.   This is why he is desperate to get the $5.6 billion:  From Donna Chaban-Delmas:  "This evening I would like to share something I just read, not my words, but those of someone who does his or her research before posting. What you will read here is a matter of public record.   This week we share with you a name....Roman Abramovich. (google him, we can wait....) Mr. Abramovich, a Russian national with Israeli citizenship, is an ally of Russian president Putin, and a personal friend of Donald Trump and his son in law. Mr. Abramovich is part owner (with several other Russian billionaires) of a steel company called Evraz - located in Canada - which, coincidentally, is the only one which can manufacture the specific type of metal beams Mr. Trump wants for his wall. (There was a Chinese company which could deliver the same product, but since Mr. Trump's trade war with China, they can no longer effectively provide it to the US.)  If the wall is built, Mr. Abramovich's company - in which Russian president Putin also happens to own stock through a complicated series of shell companies - stands to make roughly one billion US dollars during the first stage of construction alone. By the time the wall is completed, with costs estimated to run to almost 30 billion dollars (not 5 billion as the Republican parrots have been squawking), Evraz will likely triple in value.  This is of interest to Mr. Abramovich and his partners no doubt, since Evraz took a signifcant stock hit in early 2016, losing roughly 60% of its value....during the months leading up to the American Presidential Election.  Mr. Abramovich also owns a legendary yacht called the Eclipse, valued at roughly half a billion dollars.  Mr. Trump has been known to enjoy vacations on the yacht. One can safely assume the yacht has beautiful staterooms, with beds.  And showers.  And likely, given Mr. Abramovich's well-reported paranoia, there are plenty of security cameras in place....  Mr. Abramovich applied for Swiss residency some time ago, but was blocked by their government because of tangible evidence that he was involved in money laundering.  This is all public record. And it was presented to the media during the 2016 Election, when the press was slavering over Mrs. Clinton's emails and calling her "Killery".  But nobody listened.",NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Tim Baldwin https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCha7BwcF4itfzFr9DAUqdNw,MAGA!!!!!! They are going to say it openly, sooner or later, in the US.  The best policy for China is to liberate the North Korea. A free North Korean republic where the decimated 25 million 'half-animals' are born again as human beings  along the path of liberty, dignity and fair market! This will galvanize 1.4 bil. Chinese people. And also this will dismantle the moonJaeIn regime which is taking advatage of the false dilemma 'War vs. Peace'. Moonjaein, xijinping, and kimjongun are faithful servants and asslickers of satan

Robert Dahlquist You did not read the article. Its about how just being an illegal immigrant caused someone to die. Alcohol is mentioned (unknown where it came from), mentioned of out on bail for some assault( once again does not say from where) but does keep saying about immigration status, takes a potshot at cities that do not hand illegal immigrants over to ice (not police job btw).,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Jennifer Luthye thats the same thing. And is not what I said. I do not believe using immigration status as a reason someone would have lived or died.,Sad things happen all the time.

Margaret Charlton get your ignorance out of your ears. There are more factors than a simple statement to blame immigration status or lack there of. There is no actual evidence that this accident occurred because of immigration status. Peoples simple logic of well, if they where not here in the first place does not pass any body of proof tests. Theses are the facts. Someone was drinking. Someone drove a truck. Someone died. Saying this was caused from them being here illegally is not evidence. Its opinion. Saying if they where not here in the first place is conjecture. I have far beyond a GED.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer.

Deborah Bartlett  yes.... Mexico is a level 2 same as Germany, Italy, and Antarctica.   However, Mexico has more murders than all the other countries in the world combined!  It‚Äôs more danger than a level 2!,As we protect our country from people entering illegally,could we also raise the danger level of Mexico?   Our son was murdered there on vacation 3 months  ago.  The murder statistics are outrageous.   Statistics are higher each year.  There were 30,000 murders there in 2017 and 17,000 in US.  Mexico is 1/3 the size of US.   We need to investigate murders of our citizens in Mexico!

That's is truly terrible what happened to you, both. But I would argue a wall doesn't fix these things as accidents happen from more than just illegal immigrants. Universal healthcare would certainly have helped with those medical bills though.  Apple - if CHP knew he came through Texas, then he couldn't have crossed illegally. If it was an illegal crossing then they couldn't know that, think about it. That really does suck, what happened to you, but clearly a wall wouldn't have prevented this from happening to you.,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, ‚ÄúDaniel Zuniga‚Äù who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder.

Chris Hall "if it saves one life it's worth it" does that mean you are also in favor of stricter gun control laws since it will save at least one life? What about the lives of baby immigrants that have died in the custody of the government? Will we end the practice of family separation to save those one lives as well? What about the asylum seekers that would die if not granted asylum into our country? Will we reform our asylum and immigration policies to save those one lives? You say a wall of it saves one life is worth it... then you should apply that principle equally to all lives.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Dianna Lee a wall or lack of has nothing to do with enforcing our laws immigration or otherwise. So what exactly is your argument for related to Dave's sarcastic post? Wow you all are horrible at judging sarcasm or seeing the analogy between saying one person with a trait did something bad therefore everyone with that trait must be punished.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
What about all of the northern States like the one I grew up on that border another country and have no walls?  It sucks that you can't find a job with the skills you have, maybe try learning Spanish or move to a place where speaking Spanish isn't a job requirement... If 45 knows things we don't that make it crisis now that is more important than helping the Americans in California or Puerto Rico then why did it take so long for him to declare an emergency? Why didn't he do so in the first 2 years of his term when he was trying to get this done? It's not an emergency if you wait 2 years... Jim Jenkins - if control laws take lives, that blanket statement would mean you having a driver's license, being married in the government's eyes, or opening a bank account take lives... there are many countries with stricter gun laws that have lower crime rates. That point on gun control laws was also just simple way of showing that if you support a wall because it could save one person's life, then you should also support guns laws as they would save one person's life, or healthcare for all as that saves one life, or a full transition to renewable energy as that saves one life... more wall is a waste of taxpayer funds if it doesn't deal with the majority issues used to manufacture its need as an emergency, namely illegal immigration and drug smuggling.  Lastly saying that relatively few innocent people are killed by a gun is just plain nonsense. Try telling that to one family members that was killed in any number of mass killings in the last few years from Sandy Hook to Las Vegas concert goers... and stricter gun control doesn't mean law abiding citizens cant own guns, it just means they have to jump through a few more hoops. You loved your wife enough to file paperwork with the government declaring it, why cant you do the same with your gun? You wanted to drive bad enough you took a test showing you knew how to do so safely and show back up at the dmv every few years to reregister your license, why wouldn't you also do the same to own gun?,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Did this illegal immigrant even cross the border by ground or did they over stay their Visa or arrive by air or boat? A wall can only possibly stop one way of arrival, the most least used by illegal immigrants... a wall is stupid.,Yeah, no bias there...

Historically, walls aren't the most effective. Time after time throughout History, walls were built and failed. Walls didn't stop Alaric's sack of Rome in 410. Walls didn't stop the sack of Constantinople during the 4th Crusades. During the Medieval era, walls were built around cities and there were Catapults and battering rams and other siege weapons that destroyed those walls.  Read some of the historical texts from Locke and those who influenced the thought of Early Americans and the Founders.  I argue that if Washington and Jefferson were to be brought back in this era, they would argue that walls are not needed and not American. They would probably argue that after rising against kings and queens in their era to have a more Democratic system of government, that perhaps the next stage involves forming more partnerships with other nations and countries and that being Nationalistic and Isolationist is not the best direction for our nation to progress.  How about you study History and Theology and do Biblical exegesis instead of believing the lies of those in power and being driven by fear of those different from you. Go on a study abroad or cross cultural mission trip to South America and learn to appreciate the customs of those who we deem as the "other.",Meanwhile, you clearly don't listen to the voice of thevmany faith leaders and loving Christians in the United Church of Christ, Methodists, Presbyterians, Mennonites, Quakers and others who speak out against the wall. Even some of the Amish who are informed of current events speak out against the wall. It is not Christian to build walls.
Heather Love Leffel <- democrat slave troll, ignorant of how stupid they sound even when it is explained to them. The democrats will lose the house and fail to get senate, the republican majority will likely be large enough to destroy any filibuster, democrats will lose everything :) And there is nothing you can do about it. Illegals will be sent back, they will be forced to compete with the homeless and when they show up either dead from self defense when they try to rob a citizen or arrested they will get justice, the countries they came from will also be left to die as nature intended. And if you want to use the "European settler" defense, ask the Spanish who birthed the Mexican ethnicity what they did to the natives of literally half of america, all of central America and half of south America and the over 10 million African slaves they brought over, as American had merely 300k, how did mexico become such a shitty country?

James Jerome the only ones that got caught rigging elections were rep in the carolina election,Let's have an official special issue vote for the border wall at local election sites.  Only those who can prove they were born in the U.S., or are legal citizens may vote.  No fake polls or rigged election.  No mail in ballots, or dead people voting.  Let's find out how many Americans support our President and really want this southern border barrier built.  If the public says to fund it, then the Congress MUST fund it.  My guess is that at least 3/4 of the whole population want the wall built.  Democrats are afraid of the truth!
He is a idiot and a constant liar,Americans want border security  not a wall
Mary Stone not in your life time,Americans want border security  not a wall
Larry Lubiner it's already begun. I bet you're one of the same over confident tools that says there was no way Trump would be President to begin with. Keep speaking in your absolute never, we'll keep laughing at your stupidity. Under the declarations he used, they can't stop them in court. So,, coming soon to a border near you, a nice big 50 ft. barrier, complete with sharpened spikes at the top,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Larry Lubiner it's spot on,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Betsy Hammond do you realize we could have all that, is the Democrats would stop wasting $150 billion a year in benefits and protection, for illegals. Not to mention the money they spend hiring lawyers to fight depression of illegals who are felons, sanctuary cities, etc.,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.
Charlesetta Brown there are tons of crimes by illegals that go unreported by media. And, you make the point for us supporters. We have enough home grown criminals to deal with, without opening the border for criminals from other countries. We have far too much crime as it is, and do not need more. So, your argument just worked against you. Thanks for playing, we'll see next week on the wall has begun,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.

140 Democrats last week voted against a resolution in Congress condemning the act of allowing illegals to vote in our elections.. While they've been screaming foreign interference, they've been the ones to admit it. They found nearly 2 million non citizens on the California voting registry. That's right, they are indeed, after saying they weren't, allowing illegals and non citizens to vote. That should be Trump's next EO. The only thing Cali agreed to do, was to remove the 153,000 dead voters on their roll, but they insist on leaving illegals, and non citizens registered. I don't know how this hasn't already been stopped, but the entire party, other than maybe Munchin, should be arrested, and brought up on  high treason charges,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Bobby Wilson keep them closed as long as it takes. Build the wall.,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Catherine Ott Walls are put where needed.,No other country has open borders why should we
,
85% of people who come in here illegally overstay their visas. And those people are Canadians. Why don't you build a wall on the northern border, you morons?,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
A 60-high foot wall that spans 1/6 of the border is equal to a door being open? You people are beyond insane. Not to mention he's never going to get it. He's going to be stuck in the courts for years.,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Stupid analogy.,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
These people live in Iowa or Kentucky and they have no idea what goes on at the border.,People dont realize that more Americans kill Americans than anyone else. Why isn't that being talked about? I live in El Paso. That stretch of road is known to have deadly accidents. It just so happened that this individual was an immigrant. However if it were to be any other driver, it would fit the propaganda, but here we are. The dad of the victim is even writing about walls in newspapers. Why not argue about slowing down the speed limit at that stretch of road? Why not argue that the city should install more security features? No. Your go to solution - only because this man is an immigrant - is to build a 5.7 billion wall. A wall which btw already exists in El Paso, where this happened. Yet, it still happened. Bet you didnt even know that info. Hell, I bet even after learning this info, you'll turn a blind eye and argue something random about a wall. Just think about your own hatred for a second. You're brainwashed and dont even realize it.
It must be  a Federal Emergency. Trump is playing golf.,Gods, you trumptards falling for this three-hankie story.  You idiots need to live in N. Korea. They have a very, very, very, secure southern border!  With its own dictator, you'll be truly happy there!
Completely agree, Charlesetta.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
I thought the same thing. Trump is disgusting. His supporters are sycophantic dogs.,You‚Äôre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Including all the gun deaths that are created by Americans like in Illinois yesterday?,Even one death is to many !üá∫üá∏
How about the killings in Illinois yesterday? Would a wall have prevented that? Would a wall have prevented the shootings in Parkland? In Aurora?,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Was he a drug dealer or gang member?,An illegal killed my dad years ago..
And Trump understands and cares for you. lol. Ask a farmer how much he cares.,We support you and fully agree with you!!! Build that wall because Congress and the Democrats don't know how the rest of us live and go through. The rest of us don't have a security detail or the money to invest in high quality security systems.
Omar Martinez just what I said build the damn wall keep illegals out!,Build the wall mr president
Ed Schaeffer https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/border-patrol-wall-immigration-trump-senate-democrats.html,Ppl ppl ppl ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don‚Äôt yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Sheila Lessing Turn off Alex Jones. There are not enough illegals voting to effect the election for dog catcher.,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Dodd Gross but who is being investigated? Not Obama and not Hillary. And your idiot president thinks there is a wall around San Antonio. It doesn't get any more stupid than that.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
Corrupt bastards like Cohen, and Manafort, Kushner, Eric, Ivanka, Jr. If you surround yourself with crooks you are probably a crook.,Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.
Hazel Ramey how's that working out for you? ü§£Republicans investigated Hillary for 4 years and $250 million and came up with nothing. Comey and Rosenstein are Trump appointees just like Cohen (guilty on 8 felony counts) and Manfort (guilty on 8 felony counts). Steele is a former MI6 agent, (British intelligence for you ignorant Trumpanzees). Clinton was already impeached for lying to congress as he should have been. So when does Trump get impeached for lying to congress and everybody else on a daily basis?,Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.
David Owens Jeffcoat Yeah, proposals like arming teachers so when the cops arrive they will probably shoot some teachers too like the bar security guy the cops killed thinking he was the killer.,Build the Kate Steinle memorial wall "NOW!"
Greg Pyles move to Russia, comrade.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Joaqu√≠n de la Maria How is screwing around on all three wives, lying constantly, screwing contractors, not paying loans, not knowing one single actual Biblical quote, being a sexual predator, having a charity shut down for fraud and running a fake university doing God's work?,NO WALL.

Wayne Elam Jr. $150 billion that was already Iran's money held under sanctions. FYI, the money sent to Iran was from weapons that Reagan sold them to fund his illegal Central American death squad but he only delivered half of the weapons he sold to the known terrorist nation.

Susan Diane 1. you are ten times more likely to get killed by an American white guy than an illegal immigrant. 2. No one is born here illegally. If you are born here you are a US citizen. Check the constitution. 3. There are many more American crime gangs than illegal immigrant gangs. 4. Every immigrant, even illegal ones pay sales taxes, income tax and social security. They don't get tax refunds nor are they eligible for social security benefits.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Victoria A. Deobald I thought you republicans love Israel. FYI, Israel has terrorist lobbing explosives into Israel. We don't have terrorists lobbing explosives over the boarder.

Lee Grant...congratulations! You have just gone to the head of the Trumpkin Bumpkin Class of Stupidity and Delusion! When Humpty Drumpty is thrown out of office...of that there is NO DOUBT....there will be rejoicing in streets across the nation and you illiterate, brain dead Trumptards will be wailing into your China made MAGGAT hats!,As a citizen of the United States I demand that you resign the presidency and take your Serwer Rat Cabinet, the Republithug eunuchs, and your criminal family with you MORON!
Make love on guns .I dare you .in fact if your sooo convinced .then rather than use government forces to enforce your views come take my guns yourself,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
If you ask the American citizens on the border they will say otherwise,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
And u know this how?,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
All I'm going to say is El Chapo smugglers said they don't get drugs in this country the illegal way... They drive straight through... Every body keep saying the wall will make us safe, keep drugs out this that or another, but if a person wants to get drugs into the country or they just want to come to the country they will find a way... Far as the drugs go, the drug of choice now that such a crisis is opioids and those come right from the doctor... Weed is damn near legal almost every way, and crack has always been around... Now make us safer naw I don't by that because illegal immigrants aren't doing majority of the killing and other crimes... But if you think having a wall will make you safe that's your opinion, but ask all the mass shootings victims family would a wall have made a difference for them...,I notice everyone who says a wall is useless, senseless or stupid has walls in their homes. Some even have giant walls or fences around their perimeters.
Amy Hays I Agree with you.  I was being sarcastic when I said let‚Äôs give them money instead of a wall. I‚Äôm tired of everyone blaming Trump. It‚Äôs their government they should fix their side of the road. These countries should be up to par with the U.S. by now.  Right?,? People are fleeing their countries because they are afraid they are going to get raped or killed., right? Or to get a better job or education?  ‚Äîwhy don‚Äôt the higher ups or leaders in those countries do their jobs! and make it a safe and prosperous place for their people to live!! Instead of building a wall...Use the money to make those countries civilized instead of acting like barbaric assholes!  I don‚Äôt get it. Enlighten me please.
What a ridiculous statement by Godfrey.   All the people in our country killed by illegals is something to be taken very seriously.   Those are the facts.     I pity a person who believes any of the lies that the Democrats push.   They are the ones who are truely sick people.   They want to protect a criminal over a decent, good American citizen.   There is something very sinister about their agenda.   It is an agenda of power....all power....absolute power corrupts.   Communists is what they have turned into.  The  old Democrat party of Kennedy is dead.,Mitchell James lol didn‚Äôt bother looking did you

Michael Collins if a 1000 of those stories came out a week would u change your mind??  You dont hear them because they are not allowed to report it was an illegal responsible for traffic fatalities.

The choice of an individual doesn‚Äôt reflect all of them

Peter Richards omg....please tell me you were being sarcastic....33% is 1/3. 31% is pretty freaking close...no one could be that stupid...right??,Trump lies for example in the sotu he said one out of three women in the caravans are molested.    The mainstream media looked into it and found trump lied.     Only 31 percent of women in the caravans were found to be molested!  Impeach trump and lock him up!

Kathy Finley Hayden do you know what it takes to immigrate legally to Canada ? My Lebanese family , applied and they had to pass a French test , a medical test , wait 10 whole years before their papers arrived then they only had one month timeline to land in Canada ... illegal immigration is not allowed in Canada or in any other country in the world ! Stop with the hypocrisy ! Why should illegal immigration be allowed in the states ? Love your country more than you love your party guys and stop finding excuses to illegal behavior ! Shame !!,No other country has open borders why should we
Paul Burton give me one single country in the world , including third world countries where illegal immigration is allowed and no punishable by law . Waiting ...,No other country has open borders why should we
Shamir Dehghani only an idiot would state that , I don‚Äôt think you ever traveled to Europe because if you are talking about he Schengen status here‚Äôs how it works : if you want to immigrate to any of the Schengen countries LEGALLY , you need to apply for a visa in one of those and land FIRST in the country you took the visa from , then you can go from Schengen country to another freely , ONLY if your visa states MULTIPLE ENTRIES on it ! If NOT , the only country you can go to , is the one you took visa for . Now those Schengen countries signed a deal with regulations that makes them like different states . You sure have open borders from one state to the other but as long as you came to the states altogether , LEGALLY , in the first place . Got it ? Ignorance at its finest !,No other country has open borders why should we
Stephen DeVoy give me one country , one single country that allows illegal entry to its territories ... when I lived in Copenhagen I would take the train to malmo Sweden twice a week for Work , and do you know how many check points there were ? One before boarding the train , another one ON the train and one last upon arrival ... you should always have your passport on you ... I believe it is YOU who have never traveled so zip it !,No other country has open borders why should we
John Ulsh yes and if I enter Canada illegally, am i breaking your Canadian laws or not ? Also , do you have any idea what it requires to immigrate legally to cabana ? FYI,No other country has open borders why should we
Betsy Hammond those things should have been taken care of long before now! Once all the illigles are not getting resources the legal people should get it.,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.

Buck Strunk we don‚Äôt have open borders üôÑ,No other country has open borders why should we
Jill Travassos - where did you get that number- give me an actual citation please.,And all of you want the wall built- how? Taking away land from U.S. citizens that the wall would have to cross? Interfering with migrating animals? We have more problems with people coming in on airplanes than we do with southern border crossings.
Gregory Baxter More people die from illegal and prescription drugs and medical mistakes than guns in this country. You people really need to get off gun BS cause guess what Guns aren‚Äôt going any where. They are in our Constitution. Illegal immigration is NOT.,How about all the daughters killed by Americans with guns, people that shouldn't have guns, what about that moeron?
Jackie Lee Collins More People die from drugs than guns. Stop with the gun comparisons.,And a US citizen shot up Columbine, Shot up Parkland, don't get me started on Eric Robert Rudolph, or Ted Bundy. American Terrorist attack at the 96 Olympics in Atl. Yeah our prisons are filled with Americans. Whats your excuse now? Try again.
Charles Boyd JFC another delusional one who believes in the communist utopia of no guns except for the govt will keep us safe BS. Guess what- the govt doesn‚Äôt give a damn about you. You are a liability to them and liabilities are expendable. Learn your history boy.,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Elizabeth Burton Steere Trust me. You are not the majority. You think you are. Try checking out the #walkaway movement. It has been growing fast and strong.,We The People stand with you!
Sherry Carruth Pelosi has a choice to come to the table. She has refused to do so. Her job is to negotiate a resolution. She refuses to do so. She refused to attend the last two meetings. She wont respond to this last comprise. She now owns this shut down.,We The People stand with you!
Diane Ohlzen with every president. Don't you find it strange that Bush was for it, Clinton was for it, Obama was for it, Schumer was for it, Pelosi was for it. All were for it until Trump went into office. Hmmmm,We The People stand with you!
Matt Bachugan so donate your tax check to help nuild the wall,Ryan Wasajewski 1. A large trampoline is around 500 to 600 dollars 2. Itd make trump a criminal to not pay taxes 3. Damn son wered you get that diss almost hurt my feelings
Do you feel like all the drugs that have been pouring into this country and all the gun runners crossing into America and the gangs that keep people from leaving their homes after dark speaks to being safe?  There was a day when parents were not fearful of the kids playing ball in the yard or walking to the corner store for a treat OR the ice cream man? Today children are not free to live like the days of yesterday because this is now the home of drugs evil and destruction.  It is a terrifying place for people.  We are no longer the home of the free.  We are not free.  We are slaves to our government and the other riff raff who do not belong any place but prison or sent to the place they ran from to bring terror and destruction to a place that was once proud and strong and clean.  If government would do the job we elected them to do without being the greed ravaged froup it has become America could be great again.  But the Lord will have to return to clean up the mess now.,I QUESTION, HOW IS ALL THE DIVISION AND THE HATE AND FEAR MONGERING AND EVIL THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? IS THIS ‚ÄúTHE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE‚Äù? GOD BLESS AMERICA? COULD GOD SOON BEGIN TO WONDER WHY? IS AMERICA BECOMING NO LONGER WORTHY? IS THE END NEAR? IT‚ÄôS TIME TO CHANGE TO PLEASE GOD!

Brenda Flores it would take an idiot to vote for the new Marxist democrats,I can not believe Beto said he would abolish the Constitution today! He said no one follows it anyway! If that is NOT a verbal acknowledgement that the Democrats are trying to eleminate our laws.. Which is TYRANNY!  That verbal statement shows that we are fighting a domestic enemy! These people slipped through our system that failed to prosicute these people for their self confession of taking out the constitution! Why arent you people holding those accountable for stating this is their agenda..  And they sit in as a member of congress who are allowed to make laws and change them.. And no one is doing anything about it? Why? We demand answers!

Latest polls show support for his wall is just shy of 35%. Half is a bit of an exageration.,Its seems elementary, but its seems half the country wants to stay in Kindergarten for a lifetime........üôà
Nick Amato , they don't have open borders. I needed a passport and they questioned us when we visited. I couldn't just walk on over.,No other country has open borders why should we

Stephen Pierson why not they all have agreed to a wall before Trump asked for one?,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
John Wheeler but do you know how many illegal s are getting paid with our tax dollars? And Pelosi is keeping it shutdown not Trump he wants it open.,Thank you America for electing him üåüüíØüå∑‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üíãüá∫üá∏
Charlesetta Brown yes, we have enough of our own problems. Why bring in the rest from the world?,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana you're a "MORON"!!,Ppl ppl ppl ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don‚Äôt yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Janey Renteria I am saying if you don‚Äôt love this country and want to protect it against illegal invaders, then yes, you are not a patriot. Sorry if the truth hurts your little feelings üò©üòÜü§£,We true Americans are behind you 1000%, Mr. President!
A federal government who operates a catch and release program for illegals does not have the moral high ground to go after sanctuary cities.,Help me understand something... The South seceded the US for States' Rights (1861-1865) and the US Army promptly invaded, and after the bloodiest (4) years in history, the US said "No to States' Rights" by force. Now, we have New York, California and others who are demanding States' Rights for a range of things like illegals, marijuana, sanctuary, etc... costing the country way more than the taxes and tariffs imposed on the South (even with inflation) and the US does nothing? Am I missing something? And don't make this about slavery...it wasn't. Both President Lincoln and Gen. Lee are quoted, many times, that it was never about slavery. That's a myth. My point is simple, why allow states to reject US laws and nothing is done? Why are their actions not considered treasonous and criminally obstructive? Why not march the US Marshals in and arrest all those state and local politicians for Obstruction?
The government will reopen next week most likely Monday, that will mark 30 days so just relax.,OPEN THE GOVERNMENT! #TRUMPSHUTDOWN #NOWALL
Automatic weapons such as the AK-47 have been illegal in this country since 1937 so there is no need for legislation to outlaw them.,My neighbor was killed by a white male with an AK automatic weapon. In fact so many more have been killed with assault rifles that trump and the GOP are ignoring the REAL security crisis.
These children are not locked up, they are living in a dormitory setting with beds, food, clothing and medical care.  They are being taken care of better than their own families who abandoned them.,I‚Äôm currently watching a tv show called  border force America‚Äôs gate keepers. You should be ashamed as you are locking up unaccompanied children crossing the border from Mexico, I understand that you don‚Äôt want or need drugs and weapons crossing the border, but these are innocent children, and you decide to lock them up. Shame on you trump üò°  You are the most corrupt person currently on this planet, you need to be taken out of your position, and very soon
Yes, remember when Pelosi said we have to pass the Obamacare bill to be able to see what's in it.,Pelosi has Alcoholic Dementia, she needs to go to rehab!!!! That's a start to securing our borders.
Agree, it will be interesting to see how many Democrats will be missing from the SOTU because they have been indicted.,Thank you Mr. President for all you do for us.  The letter Nancy wrote to you uninviting you for the State of the Union, should you decide the wall is a crisis, proves Nancy thinks it's a crisis too. All the proof you need! She drew that conclusion without even conferring with Homeland security and other top officials!
Ambien and vodka,I don't know how how she sleeps at night.
Yes because people in their 50s/60s remember a country without these problems. After Israel built their wall, terrorism decreased by 99%, so walls work, even the least intelligent among us know that,Haha most who supports the wall seem to be in late 50-60s with no actual understanding of how it works.
Since Israel built their wall, terrorism in the Jewish state has decreased by 99% which proves that walls work, even the least intelligent among us understand that.,Except the wall won't work.
Relax, the shutdown will be over in a few days.  Pres Trump needed a 30 day waiting period before he could fire all the useless employees and saboteurs in the bloated bureaucracy.,Mr. President, 800,000 Federal employees and their families are being harmed by no fault of their own.  It has been 30 days or more since many of these government employees have been paid and many are required to work without pay.  That means paying for gas to go back and forth to work.  They are being held hostage in a political battle not of their making.  Many of these government employees work to secure our border, now without pay.  Please end this shutdown.  I support you on a strong border, but this is hurting our fellow Americans.
Relax sunshine, the shutdown will be over in a few days.  Pres Trump needed a 30 day waiting period before he could fire all of the useless employees and saboteurs in the bloated bureaucracy.,The end of the month is almost here and people who are renting are gonna get evicted because they are not going to be able to pay rent..  but Trump has a big ass roof over his head....
You really need to learn sentence structure, it will give you some semblance of credibility.,Look in the mirror for shame
Nobody really cares who you vote for.,Thomas Harrington kermit the frog would be a better choice at this point and he's a real puppet. You sir are the DMF.
There is no solution for a viable affordable healthcare system in a country that has a 40% obese population.,How about that promise to fix out broken healthcare system?
A congressman's salary is peanuts compared to how much they make on the side in payoffs.,Cut the Senator‚Äôs and Congessmen‚Äôs pay during the shutdown and things will start to work your way
There is one reason Travis that Pelosi is in a high position and that's money.  Pelosi represents a very rich district and she is the best fundraiser in the Democratic party.  She makes the Democrats a ton of money so they keep her around.,How the hell is Pelosi still in her position? Total incomprehensible!   Who does she represent in this REPUBLIC?
Larry Boydston well, god loves sinners so Trump must be loved,Larry Boydston well, god loves sinners so Trump must be loved

I'm guessing you don't live in the EU. Here everyone has open borders and every country is full of immigrants. It's fucking awful,No other country has open borders why should we
Patty Bertocchini La Puma that only stands to reason because US citizens outnumber ILLEGALS like 20 -1 but let's not ignore the fact that they dont belong here and are a drain on taxpayers, government resources,  and our economy.  The fact that they kill and rape people is only 1of the many reasons to keep them out do you have a fence around your house? Doors with locks on your house ? Same thing,Steven Reeves I was raised Republican and then I grew up and RANAWAY
Patty Bertocchini La Puma I do care but those stats are not accurate killed is killed not by a human hand,Steven Reeves I was raised Republican and then I grew up and RANAWAY
Patty Bertocchini La Puma that is one officer who would be alive if that illegal immigrant wasn't in this country to begin with,Steven Reeves I was raised Republican and then I grew up and RANAWAY
Patty Bertocchini La Puma you people just dont get it we dont want the illegal immigrants here period.  I dont care if they kill people or dont if they ride around on your democratic unicorns and spread love lol they dont belong here BUILD A GIANT WALL ha ha not sure why the Democrats are so against securing our boarders oh I know because then they'd have nobody to vote democratic ha ha not sure how you people are going to handle 6 more years of TRUMP,Steven Reeves I was raised Republican and then I grew up and RANAWAY
Brent Robinson , Do you feel the same way about gun control so that there aren't  ANY  MORE mass shootings but because it done by WHITE AMERICANS LET THEM KEEP HAPPENING,,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Brian Bray , So true but you see  that OK because it FEAR MONGERING and they were POC don't count in his book,She looks more like a fish.
David Williams , FACTS Printed, able to verify asking because worked in that field for 20 years . How about 4 generation in one family milking the system that fine with you , getting benefits just by getting a doctor signing a letter another mom and 4 kids collecting money they never paid into making more money in a month then I did $4000 and then being told that if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have a job last name Conner,3 billion in tax returns to illegal aliens with no social security number under child credit act, billions In social services to illegals, Billions In aid to countries that don‚Äôt help. Politicians getting paid while front line doesn‚Äôt, What a screwed up system, 4 billion for a wall can‚Äôt be anymore ludicrous then the other stupid crap going on.
Frank Betty Page , and 45 is mentally sound HA,HA,HA, all his womanizer has gotten to him,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
No, that would be 45 a very serious mental problem,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
So true European didn't understand why American military members acted like FOOLS when they drank, rape, when they could go down to RED LIGHT DISTRICT, we could sent our preteen to buy beer at the TRINK HALLE  and they brought home, the USA LOOK at everything as a mortal sin,I'm sad to hear this but American's do drugs\drink and then get behind the wheel and drive too. Remember Mother's Against Drunk Drivers?
Brian Ivinjack , What color was the nut that walked into the bank killed five women for no reason, who shot up the schools, Las Vegas, Jewish Temple, black church or did I miss something , ran over the young lady in VA, John Grady over 20 young men, Bundy, Tim Mcvey,How about safety in schools‚Äîoh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Ronald Bettney Are you or anyone you know  affected by shutdown or you  the  top 1% who could care less about working families,Keep up the good work. We are rooting for you. Build the wall.
Teraza Parrish , Thank you,HOW MANY AMERICAN SONS WERE KILLED BY TIMOTHY McVEIGH? THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER? THE SHERMAN OAKS SHOOTER?? SANDY HOOK?? LITTLE CHILDREN?? BY WHITE AMERICAN MALES!!??? TRUMP DOESN‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT AMERICAN PEOPLE - HE ONLY CARES CARES ABOUT AMERICAN DOLLARS!!
Mike Donovan hey DUMASS that part of government not shut down.,How about safety in schools‚Äîoh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Norene Boone oh that's smart spending year's and millions on something that's been approved by them for year's. I guess democrats are ok with just wasting the money in some other country that it would take to build the wall.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Buck Strunk No it doesn‚Äôt. The biggest wall in the world is the Great Wall of China. The Vatican has a wall like many town/ cities in Italy when it was made up of city states prior to becoming a nation. Lots of cities across Europe have walls, built during the medieval period not this century or the last. Examples such as the Vatican  are not a valid comparison to Trump‚Äôs plan.,No other country has open borders why should we
If you don‚Äôt want the wall move out of America  you don‚Äôt belong here. We want the wall demon,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Heather Gurtlinger he lied about the 4000 people that were criminals arrested at the southern border, only 12 of those 4000 came from the southern border, he lied to the American people every day he lies to his wives about how many times he cheats on them, then he lies about paying off the whores that he cheated with, he lies about hiring the best people, he hires crooks and that's it. He lies about knowing the most about everything he ever possibly talks about, because he doesn't know a damn thing about anything, except for running businesses and countries into the ground and bankrupting them. He lied about getting a one million dollar loan from his father to start his business because he already had over 8 billion dollars at that point from all the tax fraud him and his father committed. He lied about being a Christian, the only time he's ever been in a church is for a photo op or to try to talk the hypocritical evangelist into supporting him. I could go on and on, but you've obviously drank the kool aid and you're too stupid to realize when you're being lied to, that's why Trump says he loves the poorly educated he likes them stupid, so they believe his lies.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Jackie Capps did he ever wants to clear a national emergency when there was actually no emergency illegal border crossings are at an all time low and the amount of illegals in the United States is also at an all-time low, so where exactly is the fucking crisis?,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Matt Smith the drugs are coming through in tunnels that go under walls and through legal points of entry that is well known fact that every border agent has stated.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.

They are acting like 2 year olds.

Dave Heffner or TDR.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Jason Kustra It was caught on camera rude person.,Several thousand illegals climbed over a fence into New Mexico last night and no one stopped them...several thousand mostly men.  Build the Wall!

Diane Ohlzen Well "sweetie aka bitch" The Republicans didn't get it passed because our democrat disguised as a republican majority leader, Paul Ryan didn't do his job any better than Nancy.  They passed small amounts for the wall and thats because that was all Paul Ryan put on the floor to vote on.   As for the shut down, Trump can claim it but the fact is that it is Nancy's baby.  I can claim I anything, but it doesn't make it mine.  I'm hoping the shutdown lasts until approval for boarding funding AND THE WALL has been secured.  Democrats of today are idiots.

Abby Schmidt Nobody cares  any more it has become to dangerous.    between the gangs , ISSI , the illnesses a lot of which are fatal & the rapist, Drunks, & Drugs coming through the borders its time to close them.  lord forbid  one of them should kill one of your family members. then you would understand. I raised my kids on my own.  i got welfare for 6 months i took a cut in pay to get off it. it was not designed to be a way of life. Kids now get pregnant now so the Tax payers have to pay for their kids .  if you can't afford to buy insurance then don't have kids.  when they are raised on it they don't even try to get off it, we don't owe other people a living especially from other countries that is communism go to Cuba  Russia North Korea ,  they are starving ,  if your sickly, disabled or old they let you die.  your only allowed 2 kids in China & Japan.  if you get a job your paying for others medicine, housing, food, How do you want to live just getting by or have a chance to have nice things, travel give your kids nice clothes , take them out to eat. afford a safe place for them while your at work. the rich democrats who all voted for the wall before Trump won are not going to give you anything. they all have wall, gates, armed body guards. & they would have you arrested if you dared to come near them,Jim See Not really!

Angela Wilson agree so very well said,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.

Courtney Leigh poor anti American idiot.,You are one in million and million in one. Love you Trump ‚ù§‚ù§
yes exactly, the dem abortions. fucking genius response.,How many children have been killed by Americans?
Statistics show that both legal & illegal immigrants commit less crimes than native born Americans.,For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of ‚Äúcriminality‚Äù ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of ‚Äúfelonies‚Äù have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized.
Brent Robinson 100% spot on!,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Laugh until you cry!,Trump 2020!

Ruben Radar Rodriguez Amen to that!,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Charlie Daboub, Honestly no.. I'm just saying I think a good idea...,I'll vote for that man in 2020 also! BUILD THE WALL!  And anyone that doesn't like the wall or the idea of it should go live on the other side of it
Lee Grant whether he's right or not I still feel how I feel I still feel we should build the wall Democrats in anybody else that don't like it the live on the other f****** side of it not for nothing but I work my ass off to send my kid to college and now immigrants get to come here and go to college and s*** for free so let me ask the people something that don't want the Wall.. if us Americans went to their country do you think that they would honestly give us what we give them, food, housing, health Insurance, and now free college education! BULLSHIT!,I'll vote for that man in 2020 also! BUILD THE WALL!  And anyone that doesn't like the wall or the idea of it should go live on the other side of it
,How about safety in schools‚Äîoh yeah you said you would send prayers.

Angela Wilson and democrats in America are socialists.  You can tell by thise that are on this page. They are all they riot they aren‚Äôt,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Brett Beardsley from the start they have been terrified. Spot on,Both sides are afraid you'll fix things, it gives them less to fight about and less to feel 'needed'. Keep it up!

Curtis Rice inbreeding üôÑ,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Gary Kane calm down little guy.  That was barry,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
John Garrison they don‚Äôt want to,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
Lee Barrett that‚Äôs barry and Killary,Says the Russian agent.
Orie Franco yup. Non essential. And they will get all the pay back. So, you Democrat‚Äôs want more government control over your lives so you are more dependent on them?  You don‚Äôt even know how stupid and brainwashed you are. True to your Nazi/communist roots.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Nick Baker but it was ok when Barry did it? Question why there are so many non essential employees,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Rod Novoa dumb ass liberal. You want oppression and poverty,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Gary Kane I invite you for a one on one. I guarantee you will be more educated on your ignorance,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
I understand all this and not  trying to cause any arguments. But of his reasons is illegals killing Americans well there are a lot more Americans killing Americans than Illegals killing Americans just makes no sense that's all. And as Rich as he is why doesn't he pay for his wall ?,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
I'm not saying building a wall is useless just saying they will find a way to get over it or under it. Just common sense that's all.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Kathy Smith Williams depends who the next president is walls have been taken down before.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
like Putin?,Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.
Projection. As usual. Insult the Dems for the faults of your fearless leader trump.,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP

Jim Villella Democrats dish out the same insults sadly.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Amen..,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
John Decker  maybe you should read the comments,John Decker  maybe you should read the comments
Bob Roman you're a typical Leftist. Love to name call.,Build the damn wall President! This is why we elected you!
Jon Haugen , the $$$ comes from everyone.  We should have a say in how its spent.  Majority do NOT want a wall.  (And, yes, I lived in San Diego for years).  Far more effective, cost efficient ways to secure the border.,They are but it still has to be released from the treasury by law
Diane Sanchez LOL Did your California physic tell you this? Or your crystal ball? Maybe your magic eight ball? No matter which you used, you most definitely need to get more educated forms of information! Hilarious!

Ruben Radar Rodriguez ahhhhh your own profile reveals you aren't a Federal employee..... More time invested in creating this account but fake is fake....it's been reported to Facebook,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Christopher Valinski  is FLOTUS running our country or getting a paycheck ?  Or do you just have your ass hairs twisted over something that don‚Äôt matter ?

If Trump does get the wall built passed without Dems support and it does make a difference, the Dems are going to prove to everyone that they didn‚Äôt pass it because they don‚Äôt like trump. If you see the videos of them saying we need to control immigration and build barriers, then they are on stalling because Trump is keeping his promises and they don‚Äôt like a politician who keeps his promises. I don‚Äôt care who pays for it as long as it gets taken care of. I know many people who have come here the legal route.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974.

I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Lydia Heilman no let‚Äôs shut the government down when they want to give us healthcare that is expensive and insurance companies still deny claims.did you forget Obama shut down the government for that?

One of the main reasons Trump got elected was because of the wall. You really think he doesn‚Äôt have support? Do you lock your doors when you aren‚Äôt home or away from home? Do you let complete strangers come inside? Well think of America as you home.

Micheal Marceaux  too *,This a reps job to make a mess bring in the dems for a whileblame then for their inability to clear up yearsbeyond years of rep damages and get played as the puppet for the chaos so a rep can stand back in and act like a hero so fucking abusive man
We are all victims now aren't we? We have one branch of government, the executive, the potus, refusing to pay his employees, our federal workers, to force our  other co-equal branch of government, (Nancy is the lead speaker of the house of it)!  one branch can't force the other to do things! our president has shutdown our govt, created a crisis right here, right now, trying to force his demands for 5.7 in taxpayer$ for construction funding! #OpentheGovernmentNow!,My heart and prayers go out to all the victims! And if you think about it ,aren't all legal hard working Americans victims? They come here and abuse our law and order, our resources , our job opportunities, our taxes that should be used to benefit Americans who are struggling! They broke our laws and we are paying the price.  Build that wall!
He may be in a pickle?  face impeachment, or resign and face conviction! ??,A black man voting for Trump is like a virgin voting for rape.
we are a democracy! One branch of our gov't, the executive branch, the president, can't force the other!  End the Shutdown! Fight over "beautiful see through steel barriers"  later!,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

one branch of our government can not force another branch! It's at the heart of our democracy! He can not force this construction project funding! no president is all powerful! He can Open the Government and haggle construction funding later! Ya know, so his employees can get out of the food lines, he can stop racking up shutdown costs over 4.6, putting airline travel in jeopardy...,To the Democrats FUND THE WALL NOW.
Just saw what Apple said , DOH,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Kevin smith, ha so you believe in an armed revolution very gung ho of you to recommend that to the UK.

Ok just to educate you, and show you that danny the blue nose doesn't know what he is talking about. The uk has a budget of 18 billion gbp for the EU, we get 5 billion gbp back as an immediate rebate and another 4 billion gbp to spend on public services therefore the net contribution is about 9 billion gbp. Replied back soon enough for you twat,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Renee ladd magee you've been watching too much Fox news, there is nowhere in Europe that has sharia law. I live in a uk city which has a large ethnic community, and you it has problems but its problems driven by unemployment and low paid jobs not what race or which god someone follows. Do not the US have the same issues in its inner cities ?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
And as a UK tax payer you know that we pay a lot to the UK but we also get funding back don't we ?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
I think you'll fine Danny doesn't know what he is talking about,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
So Veronica where exactly did this happen ?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Dave really great sarcasm but I think it is lost on most of the people who would read this post, certain your not British?,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Jim Butkowsky these are the people that see anyone can carry a gun and look at the number of gun crime let alone MASS SHOOTING  !,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Gerri Modic Candelaria you're going to be paying for the wall with taxes, that doesn't in anyway imply that Mexico is paying for it.,Mike Hine there was bipartisan support to open the government, and Donald denied it because it wasn't the right number for him. You know my views about Donald more than probably anyone else Mike.

Karl Hesford cars kill people you want car control also. Thousands of babies are killed daily and you probably support that.,America is truly a fucked up place. Thousands of Americans are shot by other Americans.

Rob Egerton right on that abortions kill thousands a day.,Far more Americans are killed each year by fellow Americans - especially with guns, but he's not bothered about them.

Fred Leenhouts democrats only condone violence they themselves create to incite panic so they can continue to take away privileges that was never supposed to be able to be amended. I am of course referring to our Bill of rights that they have in fact effectively changed to a bill of privileges that they can take away at anytime without notice, cause, or due process of any kind.,YOU CANT DEAL W/THE DEMOCRATS,THE ONLY THING THEY UNDERSTAND,IS VIOLENCE,\

They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Seems to work all over the world..are you on the take somehow...,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Lea Callahan you're as big of a joke as your "president",Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!

So sorry for your loss.

I stand with our president, and I stand with all who have lost a loved one because the Democrats refuse to help support the wall.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road.

More : Sarsour was honored as one of the ‚ÄúExtraordinary Brooklyn Women,‚Äù and has sparked controversy because of her closeness to Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York. The newspapers added that in the past, if you wanted to become mayor of New York, you had to campaign to get closer to the Jews and get their votes, but now in a clear shift, you need to race not only to get the support of Muslims, but the voices of those with ties to Hamas, as is the case Linda Sarsour. Sarsour has also been charged with anti-Semitism because of her public pride that she has relatives who have been convicted of belonging to the terrorist Hamas movement.  Linda‚Äôs brother, Jameel Sarsour, is accused of belonging to the terrorist group Hamas and being on the terrorist list of the United States government, under the category of a ‚Äúspecialized international terrorist‚Äù by the US Treasury Department. It is strange that Jamil Sarsour lives freely in the U.S. although the government has given him this terrorist label. The FBI agents who investigated him, including FBI agent Robert Wright and retired FBI agent John Vincent, are very angry about it.  Despite this, Sarsour was a familiar face in the Obama White House. The Obama administration opened the White House to adherents of political Islam; they attended hundreds of meetings at the White House. Court documents and other records have confirmed that many of these visitors belong to groups that act as fronts for the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and other Islamic organizations. These investigations were based on a comprehensive analysis of records of visitors to the White House. These meetings were conducted with groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and other groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2013, White House officials received a delegation from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, which is now banned in Egypt and many Arab states as a terror group. It seeks to impose Sharia by force. They visited the White House. And Sarsour confirmed that she was invited to at least seven White House meetings between 2010 and 2014.  Obama is gone from the White House, but Sarsour‚Äôs continuing influence on the Left is a bad omen for America, a sign of what will happen in the future.   https://www.jihadwatch.org/.../linda-sarsour-is-a-bad...jihadwatch.org,Linda Sarsour is a Bad Omen for America. This person is a liar, an enemy of the United States and Israel! It will have to be EXPULTED. We are afraid for your safety.  Jan 19, 2019 8:00 am By Rami Dabbas - 30 Comments  Every day more secrets are revealed about the Muslim Brotherhood and the State of Qatar, which stands behind the Muslim Brotherhood and supports it financially and morally through several tools and institutions, both inside Arab countries and in the West, especially in the United States of America, under the cover of the charities and NGO organizations located in those countries.  Linda Sarsour is an Arab American of Palestinian origin and executive director of the New York-based Arab American Society, an association that is administratively linked to the Qatar Foundation International and ideologically follows the Muslim Brotherhood and Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi ‚Äì a terror promoter ‚Äî who strongly supports the terrorist Hamas movement and the Qatari government, which is allied with adherents of political Islam. The Qatar Foundation International is closely linked to the Qatari government. Former US Treasury Department analyst Jonathan Schanzer describes the institution as ‚Äúan ATM for the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliated groups, the spiritual father of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, as well as funding Hamas and terror groups in Syria.‚Äù Schanzer stressed that Qatar‚Äôs neighbors from Arab countries were ‚Äúnauseated‚Äù by Qatar‚Äôs support for the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Qatar Foundation and the Emir of Qatar established the Al-Qaradawi Research Center in honor of Qaradawi. The purpose of the Center was to promote Al-Qaradawi‚Äôs ideas on the basis that he was a pioneer of moderate Islamic thought for Muslims today. In January 2012, the Qatar Foundation (QF) opened a center for Islamic legislation and advocacy. Tariq Ramadan, the grandson of the Brotherhood‚Äôs founder Hassan al-Banna and the son of Brotherhood leader Saeed Ramadan, was appointed as the director of research of the center.  At the same time, the Qatar Foundation has strong ties to the International Institute of Islamic Thought, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States that was investigated on terror finance issues after the 9/11 attacks. The deputy director of the Qatar Foundation for Islamic Legislation and Advocacy was Jasser Odeh. At the same time, he taught and lectured at the International Institute of Islamic Thought, as he mentioned in his own profile. The Muslim Brotherhood in the United States described the International Institute of Islamic Thought as one of ‚Äúour organizations and institutions owned by our friends‚Äù in a secret memo issued in 1991. The memo states that the purpose of its network in the United States is ‚Äúa kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destructing Western civilization from within.‚Äù  Now we come back to Linda Sarsour, who also has suspicious personal relationships. In 2004, Sarsour told the press that the US authorities questioned her and her Palestinian husband Maher Judeh, who was threatened with deportation after living in the United States for seven years. In the same interview, Sarsour mentioned that one of her cousins spent 25 years in prison in Israel, and that a family friend was sentenced to 99 years in prison. She added that her unmarried brother was also serving a 12-month sentence for being a member of Hamas.  The New York Police Department opened an investigation into the relationships of the Arab-American Association, headed by Linda Sarsour, and tried to obtain information about its board members. It found that its chairman was Dr. Ahmed Jaber, head of the Dawood mosque, known as the Islamic Mission in America. Sarsour is constantly trying to portray law enforcement officials and the government as unfair to Muslims, and her claims and fears of terrorist plots are in fact government conspiracies, according to Sarsour.  For example, Sarsour said that New York police detectives fabricated terror cases so they could get funding for the New York Police Department. The government stopped an al-Qaeda plot to destroy an aircraft using an explosive device hidden in a person‚Äôs underwear: Sarsour claimed the attacker was actually a CIA agent. In an interview, Sarsour said that ‚Äúfear of Islam‚Äù is merely a manifestation of American persecution of minorities, and the United States remains a democratic state with an authoritarian element. Sarsour is known to launch fierce attacks on Muslim Brotherhood opponents, including Muslim dissidents themselves, so the Qatar-affiliated Brotherhood put its money in the right place when it decided to invest in her organization.

Just because Trump calls all the media outlets fake news doesn't make what he says true.   "The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command." - Orwell, 1984  And yet so many run like lambs to slaughter behind this President. Open your eyes, open your hearts. The enemy is not outside our borders, it's sitting in the White House.,Heaven forbid the government tries to give everyone healthcare! Much better for the government workers to lose their homes over a wall the majority of Americans don't want. Don't be a martyr for me sir.

Heaven forbid the government tries to give everyone healthcare! Much better for the government workers to lose their homes over a wall the majority of Americans don't want. Don't be a martyr for me sir.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Maybe you tell that to members of congress, they won't negotiate...,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

I'm sorry you still believe in a man proven to be immoral (not just adultery but scamming workers from their pay and much more), rude, disrespectful to our men and women in service and veterans; a man with the demeanor of an angry spoiled child who happily watches people having to go to food banks, some even putting their homes up for sale, because this man, this one you still believe in, will not accept what has ALREADY been offered in a bipartisan offering to add to the billion he hasn't spent yet on border security. This is a TEMPER TANTRUM! Do you have children? Would you let all the other children suffer because of the actions of one? And yet you believe in him still.

Carl Ostendarp STFU -- obama went golfing 8min. after one of our journalists was beheaded .https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/us/politics/a-terrorist-horror-then-golf-incongruity-fuels-obama-critics.html,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Kris Landers How hard for you is this to understand ??? If the person was never in the country, he wouldn't have been here to cause the accident. -- Get that GED, you need it .,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

DONALD TRUMP is a TERRORIST: a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

That's what made this country great.!in God we trust & think positive instead of destroying the head.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...
Brandon Wright slowing down illegal immigration would help our homeless and needy immensely. Do you know how much our government programs are giving money , food stamps, free medical, etc. to illegals!? While our vets and needy citizens go without. In the state of Colorado, if you are illegal, you will pretty much instantly qualify for government assistance. It is sickening.,And if you don‚Äôt look out for your citizens?? At what point does one outweigh another. You truly can‚Äôt say you care about America when there is so many people working for the government, your government, not getting paid....I mean come on

So this situation is made better by allowing illegal dangerous criminals into our country???,In Chicago every 14 mins somebody is getting shot. The man who created the massacre in Las Vegas? All these shooters are "legal Americans"
Tell that to the ranchers on the border whose property and homes are invaded regularly by illegals.,trump leads through fear. Just don't buy it!!

Wayne Brunner, I tuned in to CNN today and they had all the Democrats over there vying for more gun control. But the shooter had a lengthy criminal history and was not even supposed to own a firearm but he was able to purchase it. When he tried to get a concealed weapons permit that is when they did the big enough background check to find out that he was not allowed to own that firearm so the government ran by democrats there sent him a letter to have him turn it in. Apparently he didn't care what the letter said and they never did anything about it. The blood is on the hands of the the Region's government. So the government actually created this problem and now they want to step in and fix it simply by taking all rights away,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?

This chick is dumb as hell. They do have background checks. In fact you go on a 3 day waiting list. I can go down to the corner of my house in the ghetto and buy a gun off the streets with no background check and the gun won't even have a serial number on it also known as a throw away.

How is building a wall to protect our citizens a violation to our constitution???,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
You mean the wall that we need because we have people coming over here illegally and breaking laws. Yeah sounds like a national security issue to me. Btw the Constitution also states to protect the American people which a wall does. Understand?,Kids in cages is a national emergency.

Norene Boone you are delusional,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Drew Mullen how many terrorists have the TSA caught vs how many of them have been arrested? üòÇ,Exactly! The role of government is to protect its people!

April Foster all these anti-trump bashing points are starting to look like overused pickup lines...   Haven't seen the money we're now getting from Mexico that we NEVER saw before in trade? " it's peanuts compared to what he is asking for the wall "   Big changes for cars. The goal of the new deal is to have more cars and truck parts made in North America. Starting in 2020, to qualify for zero tariffs, a car or truck must have 75 percent of its components manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the United States, a substantial boost from the current 62.5 percent requirement.  There‚Äôs also a new rule that a significant percentage of the work done on the car must be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour, or about three times what the typical Mexican autoworker makes. Starting in 2020, cars and trucks should have at least 30 percent of the work on the vehicle done by workers earning $16 an hour. That gradually moves up to 40 percent for cars by 2023.  While many economists think these new rules will help some North American workers, they also warn that car prices might rise and some small cars may no longer be made in North America because they would be too expensive under the new requirements. There are also concerns that automakers might not make as many cars in North America to export to China and elsewhere overseas because costs would be higher in the USMCA region than making the vehicles in Asia.  Trump‚Äôs victory: Canada opens up its milk market to U.S. farmers. Trump tweeted often about how unfair he thought it was that Canada charged such high tariffs on U.S. dairy products. Canada has a complex milk and dairy system. To ensure Canadian dairy farmers don‚Äôt go bankrupt, the Canadian government restricts how much dairy can be produced in the country and how much foreign dairy can enter to keep milk prices high. Trump didn‚Äôt like that, and dairy was a major sticking point in the negotiations.  In the end, Canada is keeping most of its complex system in place, but it is giving greater market share to U.S. dairy farmers. U.S. negotiators say they got a major victory by forcing Canada to eliminate the pricing scheme for what are known as Class 7 dairy products. That means U.S. dairy farmers can probably send a lot more milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder and infant formula to Canada (and those products are relatively easy to transport and store).  Canada‚Äôs victory: Chapter 19, allowing for a special dispute process, stays intact. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said repeatedly that he wanted to keep Chapter 19 in place, and that‚Äôs exactly what happened. The U.S. side pushed hard to eliminate this chapter, but in the end, it stayed.  Chapter 19 allows Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another‚Äôs anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court. Over the years, Canada has successfully used Chapter 19 to challenge the United States on its softwood lumber restrictions.  Mexico and Canada get assurance Trump won‚Äôt pound them with auto tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened to slap hefty tariffs on car and vehicle parts coming from overseas into the United States. Along with the new trade deal, his administration signed ‚Äúside letters‚Äù allowing the two nations to mostly dodge Trump‚Äôs auto tariffs.  The side letters say Canada and Mexico can continue sending about the same vehicles and parts across the border free of charge, regardless of whether auto tariffs go into effect down the road. Only parts above that quota could face tariffs.  Trump‚Äôs steel tariffs stay in place (for now). Canada wanted Trump to stop his 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel. That didn‚Äôt happen ‚Äî yet. The two countries are still discussing lifting those tariffs, but a senior White House official said Sunday that process is on a ‚Äúcompletely separate track.‚Äù Trudeau has called the steel tariffs ‚Äúinsulting and unacceptable‚Äù because the two nations are such close allies.  Improved labor and environmental rights. The USMCA makes a number of significant upgrades to environmental and labor regulations, especially regarding Mexico. For example, the USMCA stipulates that Mexican trucks that cross the border into the United States must meet higher safety regulations and that Mexican workers must have more ability to organize and form unions. Some of these provisions might be difficult to enforce, but the Trump administration says it is committed to ensuring these happen ‚Äî a reason U.S. labor unions and some Democrats are cheering the new rules.  Increased intellectual property protections. The new IP chapter is 63 pages and contains more-stringent protections for patents and trademarks, including for biotech, financial services and even domain names. Many business leaders and legal experts believed these updates were necessary given that the original agreement was negotiated 25 years ago.  Big drug companies gain more footing in Canada. U.S. drug companies will now be able to sell pharmaceuticals in Canada for 10 years before facing generic competition. That‚Äôs up from eight years of so-called ‚Äúmarket protection‚Äù now.  Deal must be reviewed after 6 years. The USMCA stipulates that the three nations will review the agreement after six years. If all parties agree it‚Äôs still good, then the deal will continue for the full 16 year period (with the ability to renew after that for another 16 years). This was a compromise provision: Trump wanted ability to renegotiate the deal frequently. Ultimately, there will be a review, but it won‚Äôt happen until after Trump leaves office.  Chapter 11, giving investors a special way to fight government decisions, is (mostly) gone. Chapter 11 is eliminated entirely for Canada and mostly for Mexico, except for some key industries such as energy and telecommunications. Chapter 11 gave companies and investors a special process to resolve disputes with one of the governments in NAFTA. The idea was that if investors put a lot of money into a project and then the government changed the rules, there was a clear dispute process ‚Äî outside the court system ‚Äî where investors could get their problem resolved.  Critics argue that Chapter 11 was mainly used as a way for big corporations to get taxpayer money, but businesses say it was necessary to ensure they weren‚Äôt harmed by sudden changes when new governments came into power in Mexico, Canada or the United States. In the end, Chapter 11 is mostly gone, except for a few key industries, such as oil, that lobbied hard to be able to challenge the Mexican government if it changes the rules and tries to nationalize its energy sector again.

Angela K Christensen.   Anybody who raises their hand would be foolish. We all know they came in by plane. A better question is raise your hand if you think the current wall is the reason all the Fentanyl was confiscated 2 weeks ago. Enough to kill 57000 people. That is the better question. Obviously those drugs wouldn't be coming into a port of entry if there was no wall. They would have come over in backpacks at points of the border where there isn't enough security.,Valerie Siggson idiot
Carsten Adsersen.   How incredibly stupid a comment is that? Senior citizens partake in far less murders then people in their 20s.  Does  this mean we don't enforce the law against senior citizens? Liberals are so stupid,This is disgusting abuse of facts. Illegal immigrants have lower crime rates than Americans. To single out specific cases, is pure manipulation.
Todd Cuson   That's a different problem with a different solution. Fact is, people cross the border illegally where no wall or barrier exists. It needs to stop completely NO more.,Please  do  an  emergency  order  and  lock  the  border  down  completely.  Mexico  needs  to  feel  the  pain  for  sitting  on  their  corrupt  asses  not  stopping  it  at  their  border.

Timothy Norton, You are so right, ANY GOVERNMENT IS SECULAR, but let's don't forget THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD;  I love how king David says in Psalms 103:19 "The Lord has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all."  Also the word says in Daniel 2:21 "He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning."  Have a blessed day ‚ù§,Mr. PRESIDENT,  You are not alone, You do what GOD sent you to do, and "WE THE PEOPLE" are 100% with you since day 1,   we will obey what God sent us to do in his word ( 1 Timothy 2:1-2) to pray at all the time for those in power , you, and your administration, and all those in authority, pray   for wisdom, protection and strength. You will overcome in the name of Jesus, if we understand what 2 Chronicles 7:14 says " if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."  WE THE PEOPLE WILL SEE THE HAND OF GOD, how will destroy all this barriers ( " enemies") that are in the way in the name of Jesus .

Austin Reis Green Did you read some of these comments? Horrible how some have suffered because of this insanity.,ABSOLUTELY AND FAST.  No more unnecessary loss of life.
Except for the American people were forced to accept Obamacare which has become unaffordable and fined if they didn't obey. Thank god Trump took those fines away. The only ones holding this country hostage are the Democrats who refuse to negotiate out of hate. Get your facts straight.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Sharon, you can always seek help from Community services, Food banks, etc.,Mary Hillgrove thank you.    have a good day

I totally agree Janine!,It's not just about drugs and murders. It's about the fact people are coming in illegally. What is so hard to grasp about the word "ILLEGAL?"
Danny Jones absolutely üëçüèª,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
John Jacob üíØüíØüíØüëçüèª,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels‚Äô hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy‚Äôs and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
Pam Tigert Me too,We need more posts like this.  News only reports about not wanting the wall. Never about the American people wanting it. That's why trump was voted in.  I am sure if it was one of those loud mouth reporters on television that lost a loved one they would be singing a different tune.   Or the Democrats in office.  I was a Democrat,switched over to Republican when trump was  running.

We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

Exactly. If someone she cared about was killed by an illegal she‚Äôd fight like hell for those people. Well, maybe not even then because Trump supports them. She can‚Äôt very well support something that the man she thinks she will impeach supports.,If, this touched Nancy‚Äôs family she might have some compassion!

Oh yeah?  Where?  Where is the proof of this?  Stop eating the garbage that is mainstream media, you hack.,Wish you'd spend as much time defending us as you do Russia.
Oh, I'm sure that's proof of everyrhing you claim.  Hahahahahhahaha.  What a joke.   I'm positive, after two years being investigated by a partisan group of lawyers, they're just not reporting this collusion or defense of Russia to the nation.  Your side claims Donald Trump is dumb, but he somehow masterminded a betrayal of that size and scope.  Which is it?  Trump is a super genius...or he's dumb and every one of the professionals investigating him is incompetent?,Wish you'd spend as much time defending us as you do Russia.
I mean.. in what metric do you mean failing?  Greatest job numbers ever, largest stock market numbers... ever, lowest unemployment, low gas prices, The Korea peninsula talking?  I mean.. What is the failure you're referring to?  You don't like the guy, that's fine, but the results are quite measurable.,It's incredible to see someone fail so miserably...
You should stop typing like you're six years old.,Then u shold start telling the truth. Almost half this nation believe your lies and turning on the half of the nation. Was that your objective, to divide a nation? U certainly have done that!!!!!!!!!

Blaine Tundler   You will be waiting quite a while. No one is against border security. Absolutely no one. The only debate is how most effectively and cost-effectively to do it. I know my math is a little rough, but I understand this wall will cost about $30 billion. A virtual wall can be created for around 1 billion. He‚Äôs been offered 1.6 billion already to upgrade and repair existing structure. The $27.4 billion difference could pay an additional 4750 border patrol agents for 100 years. In my book, that‚Äôs a hell of a lot better idea than borrowing another $30 billion from China and paying interest on it.,No other country has open borders why should we
Keith Webber Jr.  Actually, anyone that is here because they have overstayed their visa Is Trumps fault. Remember, he said he was going to round every illegal up and report them.,No other country has open borders why should we
Buck Strunk   The constant state of fear you people live in is preposterous.  What exactly is it that drives this incredible paranoia you have?,No other country has open borders why should we
Exactly the declaration I‚Äôd expect from you! No different than any other leftest so There‚Äôs no such thing as God, right? Exactly what we can expect from you & millions like you. God is still in control! How do you think you got your King? He‚Äôs your president so now down to him.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Greg Pyles we‚Äôll even help him to the border, liberal jerk he is.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
You liberals don‚Äôt listen to anyone who levels with you. All the border patrol including authorities from Obama Bin Laden‚Äôs administration are on Tucker, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham EVERY NIGHT telling you a wall is what they need; that in fact they can do their job if they had a wall. Further that you ignore the facts and listen to your socialists congress tells me you don‚Äôt want border security under ANY circumstances.  It suits you just fine that taxpayers are spending over a $billion dollars a year on these assholes.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Fitz Ray damn right.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston what are you willing to bet on that he‚Äôs gone next year?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Sebastian Rodriguez who‚Äôs really ruining the economy? Hmmm? You want this president to give in to a bunch so they can do this again & again!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Mike J Knifong keep singing that song!  This president stayed in Washington over the holidays while his family was in Florida simply because of the shutdown. Where were your liberals? On a beach in Hawaii, Puerto Rico while federal workers in the hundreds of thousands didn‚Äôt get their check.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another

Statewide, 61 percent of Texans oppose building a wall, while 35 percent support it and 4 percent don‚Äôt know or declined to answer, according to a poll conducted in April by Texas Lyceum, a nonprofit leadership organization. Residents of the Lone Star State who live, work and play along the international boundary with Mexico say they are happy that the Trump administration‚Äôs plans to quickly build the wall have encountered complications in Washington. A dispute over whether to fund the wall nearly led to a federal government shutdown in March, until the president agreed to delay the plan possibly until September. On Tuesday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney unveiled a 2018 budget that includes $2.6 billion for stepped-up border security, including $1.6 billion for a wall.

Karen Ann Bradshaw aren't taxes withheld from gross pay?,I want the border secure.  I live in Texas and I can‚Äôt tell you several times  I hired someone with a Social Security number that turned  out to be fake when I filed it with Social Security.

If you‚Äôre an illegal alien you cannot pay income tax because you do not have a Social Security number. Think about that Americans.

You really should stop smoking that pipe, come back to reality, start drinking coffee. Wake up. Find God and support the truth not like Obama the father of all lies. Keep in mind(,if you have one, or can find it) that Trump is not a politician, and is the main reason Trump is President. Politicians lie honey Trump has proven himself to be a man of his word. BTW take those CNN blinders off and be apart of the solution not another liberal liar supporter of Globalization. It will be here soon enough with out your support.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Oscar Olszewski didn‚Äôt vote for either. Had an acquaintance who went to a farenthold event and was shocked at his level of ‚Äúpartying‚Äù. And McQueen was in and out very quickly and abruptly and during Hurricane Harvey no less. No respect for either. What I realized was that politicians are useless. No matter what their affiliation. Some do good, some do bad and some are really bad. So we are forced to accept levels of ‚Äúacceptable corruption‚Äù. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found down here.,Patti Vargas I have both, but thank you for your concern. In addition to those, I have beliefs, morals and resolve. But thanks again.
Oscar Olszewski in addition to that, this city is run on favors and promises. They keep raising our taxes, say they‚Äôll fix things then they never do. The city infrastructure itself is crumbling.

It‚Äôs nuts down here.,Patti Vargas I have both, but thank you for your concern. In addition to those, I have beliefs, morals and resolve. But thanks again.

Norene Boone perhaps after reading your long winded version of so called ‚Äúdue process‚Äù maybe you could get your head out of that dark space and figure out that OBVIOUSLY IT NEEDS TO BE REVAMPED,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

I think it makes it so hard for victims of any kind to not be heard or feel as if they are shut out and refused options then being forced to keep living a negative experience to a certain degree..def prolongs the healing process.. I think the wall is a good idea to protect us and put limitations to  Such severe ongoing issues regarding various trafficking matters and also helping with getting other things in order with any other system in place that offers opportunity and financial benefit for people who do come and live here legally.. We also have to consider there are also victims on the other side of that wall and need to play a role in helping control those issues as well because not everyone trying to come here has Ill intentions and are just trying to seek safety just the same .. Such a huge issue and hard to find the right approach to help resolve all matters,Thank you MaryAnn for sharing your thoughts and encouraging others ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§Prayers for you and  for all the victims families ..agree so important to keep fighting ..

Sorry, I was wrong Bob. The latest average of all polls shows Trump T 40.0%. The 41.1% is about 3 days old. That is how fast Trump‚Äôs approval rating is falling. I should have waited till Monday to say the numbers were below 40%, they are AT exactly 40% today.  Good to see you are supporting a 41% Presidential rating. Most of his followers insist he has a 50-60% positive rating. Hope you continue to support Trump when he falls below 35% favorable.,I was at the game. I swear that Bundy was short of the goal line on that last TD. They should have had instant replay back then. Bundy would not be the legend he is today if there had been instant replay to show he did not score the winning touchdown in the final seconds.
Stan Piznarski Trump has pissed both sides off with his latest proposals. The right hate the fact he is talking about amnesty for the Dreamers. The left say it‚Äôs a nonstarter with Trump holding the government workers hostage.   His approval rating is now under 40%, a death sign for all Republican office holders. Not a good time to have a last name ending in Trump or being part of the Trump led cult.   The Trump bandwagon broke down many miles ago. It is sitting on the side of the road with broken wheels and flies buzzing all around. The buzzards are circling overhead, they are attracted by the smell political rot.,Thank you America for electing him üåüüíØüå∑‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üíãüá∫üá∏

Mark Butler:  I know but, it sure would make them wise up and do the right thing for the American people as a whole and think of our country rather than their own self interests of just not letting Trump win because they despise him so much.  Over 327 million human lives versus 1 that is hated.  Odds should be in the majority's favor. wouldn't your think?ü§î,So far Mr. President, the best idea yet is to freeze the pay of Congress, especially the House.

Tess Calomino Past presidents and the border wall   http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/latest-trump-lie-discredited-several-former-us-presidents,Eddie Sturgis scared of the success .. your party better grasp what is happening to the heartland and entire running of our nation.
‚ÄúOpinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding. The highest form of knowledge‚Ä¶ is empathy, for it requires us to suspend our egos and live in another's world. It requires profound purpose larger than the self kind of understanding.‚Äù  -- Bill Bullard,Right!, don't need a 2nd attempt.
True but the point is we have more then enough criminals that were born here without importing other countries trash.,more people died in the Vegas massacre then all this angel victims put together..let's see why dont we start a group for people who were killed from hunting accidents..people killed in church massacres from a crazy gunman..why give these people special recognition. especially since trump has been using them as his poster women for the wall
You can try and vote him out in 2020 if you so badly want to remove him.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Jason Mills walls and fencing works! Ask Nancy & Chuck. They have them around their palaces to keep people like you out!,No other country has open borders why should we
Stephen DeVoy yea look at Europe right now. They are being raped pillaged and burned and the police do nothing. Open borders must be working. Not!   Right now common people are rejecting this idea. Common folks have donned yellow vest in France and fighting to take back France. So there‚Äôs hope folks!,No other country has open borders why should we
Daniel Mckinnon so you want open borders and no country? That‚Äôs stupid!,Stand firm Democrats, don't give in to this POS President who throws temper tantrums like a 5 year old who soils his depends diaper. Make him cry.. His WH is made of glass and will soon shatter..
Gwen Fiebelkorn keep your friends close and enemies closer! Most people in Government and power are Globalist Traitors. Now he‚Äôs weeding them out. Just look even forced out the head of the world bank.,Remember Obamacare repeal? Republican House and Senate, Republican president, and Donald whiffed, twice. As I said, the Democrats are not the reason he constantly fails.
Natalie Halem yea Nancy and the Democrats won‚Äôt open the government. 5.7 billion is a drop in the bucket for them! They rather give it to Central American dictators than use it at home.,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage
Rod Novoa  people voted him in just like every other President!,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Suiter Kaye ask the Democrats that run Flint why? Also know this if the Democrats cannot clean up the water in Flint just think what they will do to the rest of America if they take over.,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that‚Äôs where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don‚Äôt see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That‚Äôs unacceptable.  Anyway, I‚Äôm done discussing it.  If üá∑üá∫ doesn‚Äôt interfere,  üòâ I‚Äôm sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
Tif Duff if America isn‚Äôt great as we think why aren‚Äôt you and everyone else leaving? We would have most of Mexico and Central America trying to get in. Please!,No one is talking about free anything üòÇ I just mentioned there are immaculate flaws with all.of these and you assume it means free. Amazing.
Tif Duff problem now days is most people take the easy way out. If they weren‚Äôt we wouldn‚Äôt have 2-5 thousand people coming up from Central America wanting free stuff.   Lucky the French people figured it out and are currently trying to take back their country and fix it with their yellow vest movement.,No one is talking about free anything üòÇ I just mentioned there are immaculate flaws with all.of these and you assume it means free. Amazing.
John Decker pretty good never trusted people anyway.  Soooo?,Keep it up, Mr. President.  We are with you.  Law & Order, sovereignty
Bill, Mr. trump is compromised and has proven himself to be an asset of The Russian Federation. Remember when Mr. trump advocated on behalf of Russia at The G7 in Canada? ‚ÄúWhy are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting? And I would recommend and it‚Äôs up to them, but Russia should be in the meeting and should be a part of it.‚Äù former NBC celebrity game show host Mr. trump - 06/08/18 Why is this not a bigger story? That is not normal! Why not Brazil? Brazil‚Äôs economy is far larger than Russia‚Äôs. Russia is no longer a part of The G7 because it invaded its neighbor Ukraine in 2014! This is not a drill! This is serious stuff! Mr. trump is a national security risk. I‚Äôm correct on this matter. üá∫üá∏,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!

I swear for the ones that don't want this country to be better secured & wants to allow it to get worse why don't u go live with them in Mexico if you like that kind of life so much.   And for the idiots that keep sayin the wall isn't gona keep them out blah blah blah. We know it won't keep them all out but we need something to slow them down where they can be stopped. It takes a lot of man power to guard & stop them when there's so much of the border that's absolutely nothing there. It would be like locking the doors on your house. It'll keep more from breaking in so easy but won't stop them all. But you leave your house everyday with your doors unlocked & see how many times your house is invaded.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Ruben Radar Rodriguez is another lying Trump supporter.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Sorry, an illegal immigrant. Otherwise, the entire situation is the same.,We have criminals on the daily that are citizens including every shooter lately who happens to be a white nazi supremacist that also happens to be extreme supporters of Trump but every once in a while an immigrant commits a crime, big or small, and that's all that matters. Not the REAL crime problem of actual citizens. By no means am I supporting a killer but using it as a political boost is ridiculous.

You haven‚Äôt been paying attention have you?,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.

Democrats had funding for border security in every version of a bill they have tried to pass.  You, Mr. Trump, are the one who is keeping the government shut down, not the Democrats.  You said you would sign the bill that was presented, the bill that would have kept the government open.  Who is not fulfilling their promises??  YOU!!  And because you can't keep your word, 800,000 citizens are not getting paid, have to worry how they will feed their families and pay their bills, and some are being forced to work without pay.  We want border security, not some ugly wall that will keep us in like the Soviets did to their citizens.  Open the government!!
Mary L. Zweber  well, it‚Äôs all about the money.,So what about the families impacted by mass shootings? Or those who lost loved ones because of inability to afford life-saving medications?

This country has spent far too long neglecting it's own to benefit paco and his 37 kids that jump the border and get the dream handed to them. I'll sacrifice a few write offs to see this country made better for the ones who have been here and contribute to it. Than have those write off I worked hard for handed to Jose and his family.,I love when he posts stuff. Because then all the dumbocrats come running to say how hes a liar and stupid and blah blah blah. But what they should do is actually look through the comments and look at the likes and see what it really shows. It shows that trump will enjoy another 4 years because they are vastly outnumbered. And the reason they should look at that and accept the reality coming their way is so they can just do the world a favor now and remove themselves from it immediately.
Nancy Edgeworth you mean like hiliary and her husband did? Saying things like that only proves how stupid you really are if you believe it.,I love when he posts stuff.

Buck Strunk do you seriously think that every other country in the world has walls around it except for the United States? üôÑ,No other country has open borders why should we
Geoffrey Hostens so you wouldn't feel the same if she was ugly? Shame on you!,She is so beautiful! Why why why ?
Kim Miller you're right they would laugh at us if we close the border, because they already have all our big companies there. We lost thousands of jobs to Mexico so let's give the rest of them to Mexico too.,Thomas Morton close the boarder and they will pay. Good thing I ain't president you folks would love me lol.
Thomas Morton close the boarder and they will pay. Good thing I ain't president you folks would love me lol.,Thomas Morton close the boarder and they will pay. Good thing I ain't president you folks would love me lol.
Chris Davey  exactly right .,Have the democratic puts forward a rational explanation as to why the do not want a secure boarder?. Or for that matter any explanation at all?
Micheal Marceaux no you're stupidity is,How many sons and daughters has trump killed
Bull O'Neill HHS officials acknowledged that federal officials lost track of almost 1,500 migrant children in 2017 after they were placed with adult sponsors.,How many sons and daughters has trump killed
Bull O'Neill you mean one of the 1,500 children that are missing or the aborted babies his affairs have spawned?,How many sons and daughters has trump killed
Jeri Hendren yes lol they have about 10 better ideas than a wall. Read up.,So has the democrats even suggested anything on what can actually be done to HELP security on  the borders. For some reason haven't heard anything on that
Sophie Tkacz Wildrick name one thing he's done that's helped this country and tell me how it's actually helped this country.,Dude. Dumbest quote ever. How is this joker in charge of the free world???
,What about the far larger amount of legals killing legals? I can go to a bar on any given night and witness a bunch of people driving off over the legal limit. Beyond drunk driving, legal citizens of the U.S. are far more likely to commit crimes statistically. What are we doing for the far lager amount of people hurt by legals?
,Affffff he still playing this game and the trump-zombies are ‚Äòoh yeahhh‚Äô... Jesus, year by year guns are killing innocent pple and Americans (not only in North America but in the whole north, centre and south... all sent from U.S.A.) more pple are dying from guns from America than casual accidents where unfortunately people had their faith to cross with, which involves anyone that comes from other countries trying a better life in U.S. - but yeah let‚Äôs talk about people from other countries coming over U.S. because that sounds legit instead of the real problems you guys are facing ... are you guys drinking the kool-aid or what ?! (Everyone remembers how the kool-aid pple died right??!) stop being fool ! He is the only one killing Americans and everyone elses while making profits on the top of it! ... and Trump-zombies are applauding believing every kind of nonsense - what a clueless nation!
,So, parading victims‚Äô families? Looking for ratings, right?   An illegal made your bed thousands of times and you were fine with that bexause you and your ilk saved $$ in wages. So GTFOH with your parade, #hypocrite.
Estefania Torres Restrepo not if we get enough ice agents to round them up and throw them the hell out of here,You‚Äôre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
What is disgusting is that You can't accept the truth more reality,You‚Äôre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
And that's why the Democrats oppose the wall. It's apparent that they are getting kickbacks from the Mexican cartel. Just like the last Mexican president was getting. Most likely what Chapo said is true the Pelosi and the Democrats are on the payroll,There are Five groups that oppose a wall/barrier and increasing border security: 1) Those that smuggle people into the US. 2) Those that smuggle drugs into the US 3) Those that smuggle guns into the US 4) The Blue fascist rats. 5) Brainless zombies who believe anything the Blue fascist rats tell them‚Ä¶.
So go over there and do what you say you want to do. Nobody's stopping you,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels‚Äô hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy‚Äôs and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.

Javoris JV Dubose I have to disagree with you I'm not sure what you're doing wrong is everybody in New York is getting a higher refund and last year. So you better find a new accountant even with New York high tax rate we are winning. Maybe you don't pay taxes I don't know why you post this,Young woman from NY was just murdered by an üö´ illegal her body put in a suitcase and dumped on the side of a road in Connecticut. BUILD THE WALL
That's What sanctuary cities are all about,Young woman from NY was just murdered by an üö´ illegal her body put in a suitcase and dumped on the side of a road in Connecticut. BUILD THE WALL
David Owens Jeffcoat typical reply by Trump lover‚Äî always insulting,How about safety in schools‚Äîoh yeah you said you would send prayers.
You cried that Obama was going to deploy the military and enforce good rules on everyone. Trump literally does exactly that and crickets from you hypocritical idiots.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Liberalism is a disease!,No other country has open borders why should we
Liberalism is a disease, treated as such!,Don‚Äôt give in Mr President

Ruben Radar Rodriguez you are in a minority as more and more NOT 100% backing POtuS. 60% say no to Wall,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Pewlosi is the pockets of the Mexican drug cartels,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
It shows, he is just winging it and if it goes bad just blame the flag or this wall,
Jason Reger explain to me how you got into this country if you are not native american?,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Fay Johnson me to....praying he goes to hell,Mike Holub so sad you saying something like that
Joseph Siegel funny how no one mention this until he said it...but its not true...its not just free money....learn how this works before you run stupid crap from dumb ass trump,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
William Bieke everything you just said was wrong....learn about how that works before you listen to that idiot...go back to your coloring book,Lies, lies, lies.

You said Mexico will pay for it. Now you shut down the government you lied.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Linda Gurtz Hildreth big deal ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Let me explain, Angel Moms are the mother's of children murdered by ILLEGALS. 100% of these children who were murdered by ILLEGALS Were murdered by ILLEGALS. And yes, more children are murdered by citizens than non citizens but that doesn't negate the fact that illegals are murdering children in the USA. If liberals really wanted to stop the no 1 cause of murder in this country they would help Americans overturn Roe V Wade.,I bet every Angel Mom would go without a paycheck in exchange for having their child back!

Dave Callender maybe you should have died in that accident then you would have some ground to stand on for your argument like the other family's that have lost family to illegal alien's.  Think man they break the law when coming into our country and break the law after they are here. You go to their country's and break the law. See what happens to you.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Jimm Jenkens your right. And the founding fathers made sure we would have the right to bare arms in the future with the 2nd amendment.  That's so we can defend ourselves from those that would do us harm and the socialist government that is trying to arbitrate a coup against our duly elected government,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle.

The best way to end this shutdown is for TSA to go on a nationwide strike tomorrow morning so Congress cannot leave and millions of Americans get severely inconvenienced.

Rick Voss Obama quickly, but not soon enough, that the Kim family is not to trusted. Trump hasn't figured that out yet.

Matthew David Martin Truly on of the best refutations of liberalism I have ever read. Short, to the point, and informative.,Thank you Mr. President. #BestPresidentInYourLifeTime
This especially pertains to DemocRATs and RINO RepubliCONs: "No man's life, liberty, or property are safe while the legislature is in session." -- Mark Twain,As long as we have Democrats in government we the people aren't safe. They want complete control that will ruin America.
Deborah Bartlett no it wasn't. The initial package included a 19th century wall with no technology being used. Geez, don't you people ever pay attention?,I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.
Keith Nance well guess what. It isn't. Trump proposed a 19th century steel wall. We need to utilize a 21st century solution that will both cost less and be better at securing the border.,I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.
If illegal immigrants are so dangerous why does he employ them at all his Trump properties?!

And Mexico will pay for it!!! (oh, we‚Äôre not doing that anymore?) üòè  Don‚Äôt you feel just a little stupid?,WHY is declaring a National Emergency to address a National Emergency in The United States considered wrong? There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, "homes of the rich and famous‚Äù and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers"  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year." (* 2017, FAIR's)  This does not include cost of loss of life, property, and Democratic stability.
Horacio Daniel Hernandez to South Americans everything in the US is gold also! You can't just let people in without them following the process that's what Buck Strunk is trying to say!

Kristen Scarbrough it's not just one person it's millions.,You can't hate an entire race for one persons screw up, what if every race that white people did wrong forced you back to where your ancestors came from because trump got one person killed, one person.. You can't live life in anger and hate, it solve nothing and creates chaos... A wall should be built agreed , but hate is not the reason. Passion deprived from a Greek word "pascho" meaning affliction or suffer. "You ask God and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions". James 4:3

Greg Merz, our differences probably stem from what we read and listen to rather than some of the other things you suggested.

Kim Miller and you are the recipient  of the idiot of the day award.,Donna Rinerr, Great then tell Trump his Great Wall is only 423 miles long because that is not what he is saying.
Reworking immigration policies?  This is not different than banning guns.  Bad people will always find a way to have guns.  Reworking the immigration policies doesn‚Äôt do anything for the illegals.  Having a wall creates a funnel that limits the influx to specifically controlled areas.   Many people support affordable healthcare but what we have now isn‚Äôt affordable.  I don‚Äôt support a balanced budget.  I support a budget that has us bringing in more than goes out.  Stop sending money to undeserving countries for no reason.  Every broke person in the world doesn‚Äôt support tax cuts for the wealthy.  I don‚Äôt support them but I do recognize that certain taxes, like business income tax, must remain low so we can generate jobs and keep the jobs in this country.  We all support infrastructure spending so let‚Äôs stop spending 150B on illegals each year and build a wall for 5B so we can save 100B.  We then can use that money for infrastructure.,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.

Ryan Clunes looks like the brainwashing has worked rather well......,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Nicole Jarrett  ... They will all get their back pay in full as soon as the Wall is funded. Even if they didn't work a day during the shut down. Neither will they be charged vacation or sick days. It always happens this way. Shut up and take the win. Funny ... did you complain when obama and Clinton shut it down for 16 and 21 days respectively? ... ** crickets ** ... thought so.,American's want their f*cking paychecks, Mr. President!
Larry Boydston who is talking about CNN? These are polls by Quinnipiac and Harvard CAPS,Polls say building that wall is not that important to Americas

Dennis Coughlan I don't get it, if I want to keep you out of my yard and I build a big ass wall with Barb wire on top with cameras , with sensors on the ground, your saying it won't stop you? It will stop   95% of it for sure,How are democrats stopping you from building a wall you said Mexico would pay for? Is it because you lied and are now trying to stick American tax payers with the $25 billion dollar wall. Your stupid wall idea only covers a small percentage of the country and does absolutely nothing to stop the 40% of immigrants that fly in. Your $25 billion dollar wall will do nothing to stop illegal immigration. Why dont you just be honest and admit you know how to embezel and extort a ton of money from this wall project.
You must not have seen the videos of the fat woman with children walking across the very high 4' off the ground piece of wire and walking right in.

Drey Claude This is not a Trump issue. You must be 2 year's old. It's been a big issues since. President Reagan. Bush Clinton bush Obama all recognized it.

Katie Curran I guess your not paying attention. Ford motors is now not going to build trucks or truck parts in Mexico. They are moving those jobs to the USA. It's a multiple billion dollar deal. Yep they are paying for the wall,YOU AREN'T FULFILLING YOUR PROMISE!! YOU SAID MEXICO WOULD PAY. NOW YOU WANT AMERICAN MONEY TO PAY.  YOU ARE A LIAR!!
Mexico could have saved themselves Billions if they would have built the wall themselves.,Mexico could have saved themselves Billions if they would have built the wall themselves.
Kevin Couture yer still upset Trump Happened?  Get over it buttercup!!  MSM has, and continues, to lie to you!!  You want to see what immigration policies should be like...try crossing into Mexico illegally, or for that matter...all the things you would need to prove and provide to the Mexican government before you could move there LEGALLY!!,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?

Timothy Coleman you are a moron. It‚Äôs you who is the pathetic follower of things against our way of life.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Lonny Watters yes we do. Politics was never suppose to be a career.,Willard Swanke i want a wall built deep and tall.
https://www.facebook.com/derekmke/videos/275714039790118/?t=21,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Harold Meinster  Trump pulled those caravans out of his ass, sucker.,So many of us are with you.  Two more caravans are coming.  Declare an emergency and get it done.  Lets the courts battle it out.

Dave Callender this is awesome man! Godbless my brother!,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Alicia Thompson yes! We do,We need this wall!!!üíØ
And by his logic the native Americans are the only real Americans.,So by Donald Dumbs logic the united states never was a nation because it never had a huge wall next to Mexico. Seems legit.
Not mr. Trump Amed eeo Corey,you mean a wall?
You're delusional,you mean a wall?
Edgar D. Gutierrez the first lady was here LEGALLY and then became A LEGAL CITIZEN. What part dont you understand so that I can dumb it down to your level.,America first! Trump 2020!

9pm Eastern,What time is the speech tonight??
Cindy Ann Godfrey, your a special.kind of DUMB,Mitchell James lol didn‚Äôt bother looking did you
If you believe this bullcrap, then tell please tell PeterPan and the Easter bunny, hello....geez....do you have walls around your house???,Hey! You actually said something with some truth in it!!! Americans do want border security! That's what Democrats are standing up for! They want methods that are more likely to be effective than your huge wall. They are willing to continue talks about border security - which don't have to include a government shutdown. They had agreed to a funding package that included money for wall repair and some building, where applicable, but you refused to budge unless they totally capitulated to your demands for funding your wall. Way to show you care about our people - not!  Democrats are quite willing to work on improving border security. They also want legal immigration, rather than illegal immigration. But calling anyone coming to our borders "illegals" is not right. They are only "Illegals" if they try to avoid the vetting process. There is a lot of work needed to improve the immigration situation, but your stubborn insistence upon doing it only your way will get nowhere fast.
Matt Bachugan I pay taxes I dont get a refund, I'm a working American who pays for dipshits like you to get a refund you dont deserve,Ryan Wasajewski 1. A large trampoline is around 500 to 600 dollars 2. Itd make trump a criminal to not pay taxes 3. Damn son wered you get that diss almost hurt my feelings

Why is it oue responsibility to pay you for your medical problems, cant work my back hurts,cant work hurt my neck, cant work my knees hurt, look people it is not the governments duty to provide medical and money to its citizens, it's your job as a citizen to get a job with insurance benefits,He's not ever going to change.  I'm not ever going to forgive his cowardice cutting off benefits for the people who really need it. I'm a 49 year old who has had back surgery and I'm going to have to have neck surgery soon. I can't ever hold a job cause I can't sit down or walk very much.  He's the worst president ever including all the republicans.
Kris Landers way to blame the victims. Maybe if I don‚Äôt wear a short skirt, I won‚Äôt get raped either. Nice try but it is the rapist fault for raping a 6 year little girl. Who he drugged btw,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak so it‚Äôs ok when the democrats shut the government down,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited

Sha-nee Lacey they can draw unemployment til the government shutdown is over and then they get back pay.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
It isn't a damned competition you myopic virtue signaling troll! Illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be here, FULL STOP!  By your logic lets let them in because we already have mass murderers?! That is really a very special kind of stupid, princess!,The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!
So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat! What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here they could not kill anyone you mental midget!,I know 500 people who were shot almost killed in Vegas.... Anything being done about that?  Your promise that Mexico will pay for it died yesterday üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£üá≤üáΩüá≤üáΩ
SO it's a competition?! I s that  what your point is?! Or are you saying that crime by our own citizens justifies letting illegals border jumpers in?! "Meaningful gun reform?!" Exactly what is that?!  Most of the schools and mass shooters have obtained their weapons LEGALLY, through background checks and "common sense gun controls!" The Florida theatre shooter bought one just for the occasion the day of the shooting! Or then you have those who are criminals like the Aurora shooter of 5 who couldn't get a legal gun so guess what he did, come on Chris, guess what HE DID?! He got one ILLEGALLY!  Not one gun used in a mass shooting in this country was acquired by private sale or transfer either! The UnConstitutional Common sense gun controls we allowed last time with the promise "this will fix the problem" even knowing it would not, have failed miserably and cannot be documented as saving ONE, not ONE American life! You know what has worked, good law abiding citizens who were armed and shot back! You really are a myopic liberal lubricant! #ShallNotBeInfringed!,Mass shootings kill hundreds in America, when do we institute meaningful gun reform.
If they had barriers for 1900 plus miles of WIDE OPEN territory where illegal border jumpers can just walk in, the BP could focus more resources on those tunnels!  I have not heard of 10,000 invaders coming through a tunnel you asshat!,I hope nobody invents tunnel technology.
https://www.kvia.com/news/border/far-from-migrant-caravans-border-crossings-surge-in-texas/911604294,41 year low.....
BTW, if we secure the 1900+ miles of open territory these border jumpers can just walk through, BP could focus more resources on tunnels! I had not heard that caravans of 10,000 invaders were coming in through the tunnels or landing at the airports! You asshat!,Yeah a wall doesn't fix tunnels or airplanes must I keep going ?
If that wall saves 1 ONE, American life from being a victim of these illegal border jumpers it is worth every dime!,Yeah a wall doesn't fix tunnels or airplanes must I keep going ?
By that logic we should ONLY let in violent criminal illegal border jumpers to balance out the scales of justice?! Wow, you're really a special kind of stupid!,And a US citizen shot up Columbine, Shot up Parkland, don't get me started on Eric Robert Rudolph, or Ted Bundy. American Terrorist attack at the 96 Olympics in Atl. Yeah our prisons are filled with Americans. Whats your excuse now? Try again.
So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat!

As long as it isn't your family who is dead, right?! As long as it hasn't cost you personally, yet!  It isn't a competition ffs! Illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be here, FULL STOP! Between the ACA and these illegals flooding our ERs and hospitals for FREE, my 36 year old daughter is dead, how are your kiddos?!,Yes, Protect all Americans!! 5 killed yesterday from US citizen. The national emergency is gun control and affordable healthcare!! Not wasting money on a wall, Years in the courts!!

End "Gun  Free Zones" and that kind of BS will go way down!,Build walls around our High Schools, Night Clubs and Post Offices then
I refuse to argue with a myopic liberal moron, you will just drag me down and beat me with experience!  Illegal border jumper killers are everywhere, who knows maybe drunk in a car near you!,Hmmm. I know that is sad but there are more family members who lost loved ones inmass shootings by white American males.

If you threaten or defy American power and might, I encourage you to make your peace with your god and prepare for for your rewards!,American arms and armed forces kills families in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and probably Venezuela and Iran too. So all those mentioned countries will allied either China or Russia to protect their beloved families.
Emil D√∂rr Really, from germany?!  How is the muslim take over under your glorious merkel going?! Asshat!,1 year ago. #msdstrong  How many children die from gun violence? Declare THAT emergency.
There is no such things as "Gun Violence" or "manmade climate change", both are made up crisis! guns do 3 things, they fire, they fail and they rust, hate is in  the heart and you cannot legislate that! Finally it isn't a damned competition you witless troll, illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be her at all, FULL STOP!  By your logic because we have an epidemic of social violence brought on by liberal ideologies, we should let in more criminals?! You really are a special kind of stupid!,1 year ago. #msdstrong  How many children die from gun violence? Declare THAT emergency.
How many of your ancestors were raped, tortured and murdered by Indians before America ever came to be?! Mine were being slaughtered by them in 1622 here! Next!,How many native Americans your family killed

What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here they could not kill anyone you mental midget!,Was the dude who just murdered 5 people and injured police officers in Aurora, Il an Immigrant? Or do their lives not count because an American citizen murdered them? Just curious, Because I see conservatives mock school shooting victims, but then try to claim a moral high ground when a criminal who happens to be an immigrant attacks someone.
"Hardship!"  you mean like Officer Rohnil Singh's family is facing, or the tens of thousands of families whose loved ones will never be whole again?!  Like our 36 year old daughter who died last June because of illegals?!  Is that the kind of hardship you mean?!  At least those Americans in hardship have been made whole, and I did not hear of the shutdown killing one person!  #FinishTheWallNOW! #DeportThemAll!,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.

Curtis Rice lol - these comments are great. No one can even pull a BreitBart article above crime based on demographic.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Might be the stupidest analogy I have read. Maybe confer with your elves before writing something insane the next time.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do.

Hello Dave how are you,Can‚Äôt build the wall fast enough.
Please let me be your friend,Just reading through these posts proves that liberals HATE President Trump and everyone who voted for him. They spew their hateful lies and try so hard to hurt and anger. They don't get it. Most people don't live in a dark world where trolling online is their only entertainment. Pretending to be intellectually or morally superior has become the left's pathetic and desperate grab for power.
Toni Saunders how are you,Build the wall from sea to sea.
Valerie how are you doing,The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that

Go to the freaking border for 1 day, and you will see the real threat. Just don't fly if you think it is a big threat. Wake up, you people have no idea how bad it is.

Addy Means , not true, there are a few Dem Senators that are donating their pay while the shutdown continues..... I support Trump 100%,  and just like there are some Republicans that need to go, there are some good Dem's, unfortunately Pelosi and Schumer are NOT!,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Kathleen Scott, Everyone, contact your representatives and email all of Congress to support ‚ÄúNo Government No Pay Act of 2019.‚Äù Bill , to stop congress from getting paid in a shutdown going forward. They are the ONLY ones that should not be getting paid!.,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate

You mean trumpturds I'm sure!,DEMONcrats no longer have OUR interest...just their own and it's not good for our country...they ALL need to be removed from office at this point....
He can't run from prison!!,I love when he posts stuff. Because then all the dumbocrats come running to say how hes a liar and stupid and blah blah blah. But what they should do is actually look through the comments and look at the likes and see what it really shows. It shows that trump will enjoy another 4 years because they are vastly outnumbered. And the reason they should look at that and accept the reality coming their way is so they can just do the world a favor now and remove themselves from it immediately.
Kathy A Norton wrong, the Democratic party refuses to talk so Pelosi is causing the shutdown. Trump has been waiting in Washington DC while Pelosi went to Hawaii and the Democrats went to Puerto Rico to party.   Get you facts right before speak.  Democrats want to protect illegal immigrants over the security of the American people.  DEMOCRATIC SHUTDOWN..,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Beverly Hurst Smith he never had full control.  The Senate needed 60 votes so why don't you get your facts straight and take some civics classes.  McConnell should have used the nuclear option like he did with Supreme Court justices (Harry Reid started it) and we wouldn't be where we are today. DEMOCRATIC SHUTDOWN totally.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Just as I do not understand the level of stupidity in people that think it is necessary.,I just do NOT understand they level of insanity in people that think this is not necessary

Thank you for supporting #PresidentTrump while he continues the push to do what is best for #Americans, and what Americans have asked him to do. #KeepingPromises,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Tunde Lakatos This wall is to segregate!  Just like the Berlin wall it has been sold to people in a scare method to solve a problem that it will not address and only cause isolationism and segregation.  If you truly want to address the drug problem, you should look at our ports, airports and the border were trucks are passing inspection and flooding our country.  If you truly want to weed out the de minimus amount of truly bad immigrants look elsewhere because they aren't crossing the border illegally.  If you want to address terrorists attempting to come into this country, look at the airports and marine vessels.  You might want to look at Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia as well.  Documented that the preponderance of terrorists are from those countries.  I understand you think Saudi Arabia is our friend and ally. That women and children walking hundreds of miles to escape political and gender discrimination are the enemy. I understand because Donald J.

Judy Feinberg Qualls The Senate passed a spending bill (with no money for the wall) 100-0 in December. The Republican house rejected it. Democrats took control of the House in January and passed that same bill. Now Mitch McConnell isn't even bringing it up for a vote (new session, new vote). This shutdown could end right now if Mitch McConnell wanted to. Trump isn't doing anything to help bring this shutdown to an end.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Kevin Lake Again, its not a vacation. There are people being threatened with eviction, people who could have their services shut off, and people who can't get medication all because they don't have their money now. How is that so hard to understand? Again, if Trump thinks these people aren't essential why doesn't he just fire them and show us who he doesn't care about?,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Nathan Teal you are mistaken, Trump doesn't love anything but himself and money! He hasn't been trying to open the government, he is playing politics for his vanity wall. He owns the shutdown, he said so himself.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Sandy Swaney Mahady by "whats right" I'm assuming you mean pass legislation to re-open the government so those 800k workers can get paid? House Democrats passed a spending bill that Senate Republicans previously passed 100-0.

Chris Lonas he's not doing anything you goof! I thought Trump was the deal maker? More like a real faker!,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
James Walker the Senate voted on a spending bill 100-0. The Democratic House passed that same bill. Now all we need is for Mitch McConnell to pass it and we're on our way to funding the government. Trump is throwing a tantrum for a vanity wall which the majority of people don't want.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Kevin Lake Then why doesn't Trump just fire those redundant people? I'm sure we'd all like to know who he doesn't care about!,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Kevin Lake great! Good to know you don't care about workers,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Kevin Lake its not vacation for these people. There are real life consequences of Trump throwing a tantrum over his vanity wall. These workers aren't getting paid. Some people are being forced to work without getting paid. I would call that slavery.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Lisa Hertel getting back pay doesn't help if you get evicted because you can't pay rent while you are working and not getting paid.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Takes a big man to copy and paste,No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.   STOP hurting our own citizens - it is IMMORAL.
We the will people will Prevail one way or another we will get our Wall or just piss off the demonrats by having Trump win re-election in 2020 or my personal favorite having them both.  Trump 2020-2024.,Hey here's the problem the dumbrats and George Bush talked about border security. They also talked about building wall I meant a fence. But the fact is none of them had the balls to get it done. So now with one more year till the 2020 election  the dumbrats don't want the  wall built because they won't have those illegal Voters. The Dumbrats also don't won't Trump to go in the history books as a President that kept he's promise to the American People awhile keeping America Safe  and also making America Great once again.
^^^ but a wall will keep us safe from illegals,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
James Campbell ISIS the military force is defeated. ISIS the idea lives on, and the idea is what the radicals are loyal to. Expect to see a lot of sleeper cells popping off in the coming days, as they run out of options with their supply chain and leadership destroyed and default to "blaze of "glory"".,How many shootings are done by American citizens yet you haven't passed many come sense gun laws!
The thing about radical organizations is, even once you've crushed their holdings, supply chain, and leadership, true believers are still going to attack. It's not like fighting a more mercenary or defensive force, where the soldiers will call it quits when the battle is lost and the money runs out. ISIS will keep attacking people until the last idiot who buys into their dogma is dead.

A conservative challenged liberal Facebook friends to ‚Äúmake a case, not based on emotion‚Äù against Trump‚Äôs wall. Conservative buddies flooded his post with snide remarks about how this would be impossible for ‚Äúdeluded libs.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll play,‚Äù I responded. And in order to avoid being accused of bias, I explained that I would use only conservative sources to prove my point. My primary source was a policy paper by the Cato Institute, a conservative, rightwing think tank, along with other conservative voices (listed at the end of the piece). Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm against the wall, I wrote:  1. Walls don‚Äôt work. Illegal immigrants have tunneled underneath and/or erected ramps up and down walls to simply drive over them. People find a way. When East Germany erected its wall, it created a military zone, staffed by booted, machine-gun carrying guards ready to shoot to kill. Yet thousands managed to make it to West Germany anyway. More to the point, do we really want to model ourselves after communist East Germany?  2. Most illegal immigrants are ‚Äúoverstayers.‚Äù They come to the US legally ‚Äî for vacations, business, to study, etc. ‚Äî and then STAY past their visas. By 2012, overstayers accounted for 58% (THE MAJORITY!) of all unauthorized immigrants. A wall is meaningless here!  3. Walls have little impact on drugs being brought in to the US. According to the DEA, almost all drugs come in through legal points of entry, hidden in secret containers and/or among legit goods in tractor-trailers. A wall will have little to no impact on the influx of drugs into our country.  4. It‚Äôs environmentally impractical. Walls have a hard time making it through extreme weather. For example, in 2011, a flood in Arizona washed away 40 feet of STEEL fencing. Torrential rains and raging waters do serious damage. Also, conservative sources generally do not address the environmental harm that walls create, but there is plenty of documentation available that show its potential for irreparable damage to both plant and animal life.  5. A wall would forces the U.S. government to take land from private citizens in eminent domain battles. Private citizens own much of the land slated for the wall. The costs of the government snatching private land ‚Äî and the legal battles that would ensue ‚Äî are incalculable.  6. Border patrol agents don‚Äôt like concrete or steel walls because they block surveillance capabilities. In other words, they can‚Äôt mobilize correctly to meet challenges. So in many ways, a wall makes their job more difficult.  7. Border patrol agents say, ‚ÄúWalls are meaningless without agents and technology to back them up.‚Äù Are we prepared to pour countless billions annually ‚Äî after the wall is built ‚Äî to create a nearly 2,000 mile, militarized 24-hour surveillance border operation? Because according to patrol agents, that‚Äôs the only way a wall would work. Again, are we really, going to use East Germany, a brutal communist state, as our model here?  8. Where walls have been built, there was ‚Äúno discernable impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens.‚Äù In other words, they came in elsewhere, primarily where natural barriers such as water or mountainous regions precluded a wall.  9. An unintended consequence is that a wall blocks farmworkers from EXITING when their invaluable seasonal work is done. Farmers are against the wall because it makes getting cheap seasonal labor almost impossible as few American citizens want or can even do those jobs. And if seasonal worker do get in, a wall makes it harder for them to leave! A wall traps migrant farm laborers in our country.  10. Trump‚Äôs $5 billion is a laughable drop in the bucket for what would ACTUALLY be needed. For example, according to the Cato Institute: An estimate for a border wall area that only covered 700 miles was originally 1.2 billion. How much did it REALLY cost? SEVEN BILLION. And that‚Äôs only for 700 miles. Whatever we think it‚Äôs going to cost, experience shows us we have to multiply it by more than 500%.  11. According to MIT engineers, the wall would cost $31.2 billion. Homeland Security estimates it at $22 billion. Given the pattern of spending mentioned in number 10 (plus Murphy‚Äôs Law), that means we‚Äôre really talking about pouring endless billions into something that doesn‚Äôt even work. And, of course, we taxpayers will be footing the bill, not Mexico. Given all the drawbacks, is that REALLY the best use of our taxes?  As the conservatives of the Cato Institute put it, ‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs wall would be a mammoth expenditure that would have little impact on illegal immigration.‚Äù (Emphasis mine) Also it would create many ‚Äúdirect harms:‚Äù ‚Äúthe spending, the taxes, the eminent domain abuse, and the decrease in immigrant‚Äôs freedoms of movement.‚Äù  And, we must add, since conservative sources do not ‚Äî that the environmental harms are likely to be severe.  In other words, the facts show that walls don‚Äôt work and they create even bigger, more expensive problems.  So what happened after I posted this conservative-sourced, fact-based list of why the wall is a bad idea?  Silence.  I waited for someone to respond, to engage with me. Where were the angry defenses or rebuttals? But when I searched for the post after a few days, I couldn‚Äôt find it.  My FB friend had deleted it. You could say, like Trump with the government, he shut me down rather than deal with the facts.  The ugly genius of Trump is his ability to manipulate deep, primal emotions ‚Äî namely fear and hate. He, along with Fox News, have convinced his base that they are in ‚Äúextreme danger‚Äù from immigrants and only a wall will make them ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù  Unfortunately, the need to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù safe is much stronger than the will to grapple with a complex, multi-faceted problem.  And so, here we are, paralyzed by shutdowns at every turn.

Lynn Limauro Floyd   Your son was a moron,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us.

Steven Whitehead the reason why the majority of the country do not like this president is because he has no idea what he is doing.

Tim Stump don't forget that the reason insurance is increasing is because this administration has taken bits and pieces of it to the point it does not work the way its suppose to. With that being said the Republicans had two years to replace and fix those problems but they instead fought amongst themselves. I can sleep at night knowing that if someone needs assistance because they are sick we can help.

But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?

There's checks and fucking balances for a reason, causing a government shutdown over this is nothing short of the most childish thing I've ever seen a grown adult person do,What happens after the wall is built and illegal immigration is still a thing? Which hole are we gonna piss money into then?
Jill Travassos I don't think you know how tariffs work bud,What happens after the wall is built and illegal immigration is still a thing? Which hole are we gonna piss money into then?
Kim Miller nothing in that article contradicts what I'm saying. Wtf are YOU talking about?,What happens after the wall is built and illegal immigration is still a thing? Which hole are we gonna piss money into then?

Chammy Ney Ney Jr. Can't wait for another 4  years and take back the house.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
Nick Moyte well take all doors anyw windows out of your house and let them come and go from your house and you feed them then.,If you think a wall will secure the border you are gigantic dumbass.
But I like trees üòû,Neither A or B. How about impeachment?
Oops my bad billionaire,You just call about money, why cant you just pay for the wall your damn self your a fucking millionaire
Thank you both for loving your country and fellow American citizens with your sacrifice.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Vicki Zamow he wants it to remain in force. Not be undone like Obama's EOs.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Omar Martinez  Can‚Äôt you read?,Trump campaign propaganda site. Fake news.  Bots.

GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!
Pelosi rejected the offer before it was even made. She's the freaking problem.  #BUILDTHEWALL  #WAKEUPAMERICA,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
She was too busy planning her family vacation.,If, this touched Nancy‚Äôs family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy‚Äôs heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Jonathan Burgsteiner and you are the prime example of a White Republican radical ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù male. Only Christian when you want to be. Treating females like lower class. Christianity isn‚Äôt a buffet, you‚Äôre not supposed to take what you like and leave the rest.,Wayne Denny absolutely
Evelyn Warren I absolutely feel the same as you ! I was raised in a democratic house & was a registered democrat for more years than I care to remember .  Even then I voted for Ronald Regan . I shutter to think what kind of shape our country would be in had Crooked Hilary won & all that has been uncovered never saw the light of day !!!,As a former democrat of 40 years, I have never been so proud to have left the party.  President Trump, God bless you.  I am proud to be a Trump supporter.
Give him a chance there friend!,I'm truly sick of hearing about it. Live up to your word...üòé
The wall*,They wanted the border also!!  I think we all know, the wall is needed badly!

Kyle Callender Good points and common sense logic ~ Bravo!,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Marilyn Carter look it up. üòä,trump leads through fear. Just don't buy it!!
Bob Segal I've listened to trump. I've seen how he works up his base at rallies. . He's inflated statistics to demonize immigrants, refugees, LGBTQ community, minorities and democrats! He has us fighting each other, hating our neighbors . . . . It's what he does.,trump leads through fear. Just don't buy it!!
Joe Calabrese when Pelosi gets over herself and does the right thing! She doesn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about these workers going without a paycheck when she was ready to fly off for a week!! No chance to work this mess out because she doesn‚Äôt care about anything other than getting her way! She has some grandiose idea she‚Äôs in charge üòÇüòÇ She is the culprit in this shutdown and she is the solution!! Trump has tried to make compromises and she is blocking everything, nothing more than a careless stubborn bitch!üò°,Please open the government. My husband has been protecting the public from dangerous inmates and   is working for free. We have two children that we need to feed and provide shelter to! Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana I want border security and if a wall helps with that, I would rather use that method other than shooting immigrants!! No one single thing is going to work but a wall is a deterrent. We use walls around prisons to help keep the bad guys in, they seem to be doing the job! An escape now and then? Maybe, but nothing is fail proof just added defense! What‚Äôs wrong in a steel fence with razor wire to help the men and women of the border patrol in protecting our country? I think it‚Äôs not the Wall, you have a problem with, it‚Äôs who will get kudos for actually making it a reality!! TRUMP!,Ppl ppl ppl ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don‚Äôt yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana Well, I remember when Clinton in fact both thought the wall and a stricter border control to keep out unwanted illegals.  I saw Obama say the same thing regarding our need for a wall and we had to curtail the influx of illegals. Now, we have someone willing and ready to get the job done but? What happened? The wall is still needed for the same reasons as Democrats wanted then, what‚Äôs changed with it being effective? Nothing!!! Except Trump is pushing for it and unless Pelosi gets her head out of her ass, it‚Äôs going to be a really tough time for a lot of federal workers! But hey, she can take another vacation she has no worries, right!! Nothing like working for your citizens that support you ü§î,Ppl ppl ppl ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don‚Äôt yet the ones with fences still get burglarized.

Erin Bond  Ah huh üòÅ,It would be awesome if you hadn‚Äôt colluded with Russia to win the election, and compromise the United States in the process.
Kevin Carlson  Perhaps it us their neediness & connection to drug & human trafficking.,Build a wall on only one border. Looks to me like you don‚Äôt like the people on the other side, or why wouldn‚Äôt you build it on the Canada side too? You and your followers are motivated by the color of those on the other side of the wall you wish to build.
Vicki Oldham  Child, that was campaign rhetoric.  You didn't expect Mexico to wtite a check did you? It appears that with the mess at their border because of the caravans, they are incurring some expense. We also have a new trade agreement with Mexico.,The promise is, ‚ÄúMexico will pay for the wall.‚Äù Keep your damn promise.
We‚Äôre not talking marijuana, we‚Äôre talking heroin, fentenol, fake prescription percodine, crack, meth, ectisy, Molly, rat poison cocaine.................,Campaign promise is circumstantial to factual problem: Social and Financial due to illegal immigration and illegal harboring of illegal aliens.

Alyssa Ferris  I‚Äôm one of the contractors affected by this.  I‚Äôm thankful that I‚Äôm moving on soon from being an EPA contractor.   I‚Äôm glad they are shut down.  I‚Äôve never seen more reckless spending in my life.   I‚Äôve witnessed it for over 10 years, and it‚Äôs bad.   Hurricane Maria?   They spent  hundreds of thousands of dollars on a ‚Äúdog deterrent system‚Äù for their employees for stray dogs, which was an umbrella that you ‚Äúopen aggressively‚Äù and every employee had a class over how to operate it.    I‚Äôve seen residential yards excavated that exceeded the action level for lead at 0.1 mg/kg over cost 1 million dollars or more.  And if you take one speck of dirt to the left, it‚Äôs below that level.   I saw epa employees jobs being highlighting calendars for hurricane Maria and they had to take off Thursdays.   I saw meetings over where to hang a sign, that involved 100 epa employees, that make 100k or more.  1/10 epa employees are worthless.,Patrick Buster totally!

"Donna Brazile admits stealing debate questions for Hillary, but blames the Russians By Thomas Lifson I give Donna Brazile just a few points for finally fessing up (after lying and denying) that she stole and supplied CNN debate questions to Hillary Clinton, helping the establishment candidate triumph over insurgent Bernie Sanders.  But I have to deduct even more points, because she did so in a context of blaming the Russians and partially exonerating herself. The expression ‚Äúnon-denial denial‚Äù has a cognate in her non-apology apology.",Democrats are now an adversary of the U.S. and like any enemy of the U.S. they care nothing about National Security and Public Safety..
"Indeed, what the Democrats and Mueller's team seem to be saying is that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election by hacking into the emails of John Podesta and the DNC to reveal how they were interfering in the 2016 elections.  And they forget how former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz tipped the scales for Hillary Clinton over a surging Bernie Sanders.  She interfered in the 2016 election in ways Vladimir Putin couldn't even dream of and arguably changed at least the Democratic Party results and campaign timeline.",Democrats are now an adversary of the U.S. and like any enemy of the U.S. they care nothing about National Security and Public Safety..

Melody Nehls  By the way, Melody, I should have commented that that is a very deep and cogent counterpunch, spoken like a true member of the tRump Crime Family Cult.  You win!,Serious, Real News: My Client Resigned From the White House. It's Time for Trump to Think About His Children and Do the Same  Impeachment should be far from the President's only concern By Martin London (VP Spiro T Agnew‚Äôs attorney, back in the day)  The BuzzFeed report that former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has told investigators that, after the election, President Trump instructed him to lie to Congress has raised new calls for impeachment. But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen‚Äôs testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions ‚Äúinternal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents‚Äù) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family ‚Äî specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. ‚Äî knew the details of Cohen‚Äôs secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as ‚Äúdeep involvement‚Äù in the discussions with Russia ‚Äî a subject they‚Äôve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had ‚Äúextensive discussions‚Äù with the family members. The outlet‚Äôs two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them ‚Äúvery detailed updates.‚Äù If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump‚Äôs firm support in the Senate ‚Äî which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House ‚Äî dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President‚Äôs immediate concern is Mueller. This is not like Trump firing of then‚ÄìFBI Director James Comey, which lawyers can challenge because it was technically within the President‚Äôs constitutional power to do so for any reason, good or bad. This is conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony. There can be no argument that the President has the Constitutional authority to conspire to, say, cause somebody to rob a bank ‚Äî or commit any other felony, such as giving perjurious testimony concerning the President‚Äôs conduct.  Don‚Äôt forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex‚Äìcampaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President‚Äôs power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer ‚Äî and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?  At some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment. The longer the President waits, the more evidence piles up, and the tougher it will be to get a deal. Mueller already has a federal grand jury hearing evidence that just received a six-month extension. The President should make his deal before that body completes its work. The Mueller report may accompany a clutch of Mueller indictments.

The banks are working with federal employees and they will be payed back.,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them.

I say give pamphlets of towns and address of all those opposed to the wall to those coming over without proper papers. and they can put up tents and campers for them in there front and backyards.

Dear Madame Speaker:  Due to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate. I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown. Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.  I look forward to seeing you soon and even more forward to watching our open and dangerous Southern Border finally receive the attention, funding, and security it so desperately deserves!  Sincerely,  Donald Trump,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!
Joseph Hart You'll get paid every cent brother. That being said, if this shutdown prevents you from feeding your kids then you are a fucking loser. ...or were you just using a catchy phase to sound profound?,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!
Drew Mullen I agree. It's disgraceful that Democrats would choose weak borders over American workers.,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!
I have an incredibly kind heart. I hope they all make it into America ...LEGALLY. You can't properly vet an illegal - you just can't. Fund the border wall and everyone gets paid. It's that simple. Every LEGAL American wins that way.,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!
Only one party is trading Border Security for illegal votes. That's the Democrats. TSA isn't getting paid because Democrats favor illegals over America's safety. All for votes ...not for anything else either.,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!

Ruben Radar Rodriguez üëç,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

James Kenney yes but a new car and expensive cell phones are not a necessity. Like I said people spend what they make. There are ways to save and make cuts. Each person is responsible for their expenses. I realize sometimes expenses come up that aren‚Äôt planned. I am old school and if you can‚Äôt pay for it you don‚Äôt buy it. I know people have to have a home and I am not talking about that.,I agree we need to have secure borders but get the government open so people get paid. Granted people should plan with emergency money put aside but the reality is people spend what they make.

Build wall along the Mason Dixon Line.,BUILD THE WALL!
Sophie Tkacz Wildrick üòÇ Holy Jesus I needed that belly laugh. Donald Trump was born into wealth. His first car was a limousine. He hasn‚Äôt wiped his own ass in decades. His handlers do it for him. What‚Äôs tragic though is you admire and worship  him. He‚Äôs nothing more than a two bit thief. He will go down in history as the most corrupt person to ever occupy the oval office. Live with that Sophie dear,Your highest and most important duty? How about right after your first priority of fleecing anyone and everyone of every last dollar you can? They don‚Äôt call you Don the Con in Manhattan for nothing Mr. President.
They  cant can‚Äôt legally build  it  that  way.,Go fund me page to build the wall 330,000 people have donated 19,000,000 dollars in 23 days
Richard Boudreaux they will... first you have to build it and than get paid from Mexico.... its gonna take a little time.... Ill be laughing when Mexico pays for it without knowing about it....,Build the Wall and build a wall around the liberals and California...

A ladder is even cheaper.,Thank you President Trump !!  We need the Wall.  WALL is CHEAPER !  The additions and upgrades proposed by the Democrats will incur Information Technology infrastructure costs that will eventually exceed the cost of the wall. New digital sensors, cameras, outdoor wireless repeaters, expensive servers to monitor the new equipment, expensive switches to carry the network load. Remote hardware stations needed to allow access to sensors in remote areas.  Digging to extend hard wire networks.  Server updates, sensor and camera firmware updates, switch firmware updates.  The IT costs alone are mind boggling.  THE WALL IS CHEAPER !!!!

Who you calling stupid I flunked math but my intelligence is above average!   99 percent of people surveyed say they are above average.     And the other half is even higher, if you asked them about their children.,Trump lies for example in the sotu he said one out of three women in the caravans are molested.    The mainstream media looked into it and found trump lied.     Only 31 percent of women in the caravans were found to be molested!  Impeach trump and lock him up!

We can safely live w/o walls in Germany. We've teared them down in 1989. We don't need an arsenal of automatic firearms in every household.......and we have a community which cares for refugees in solid living conditions. That's where the difference is to be lead by a government without everyday lies,Sheryl Whitfield-Tolliver   love your irony........hahaha  - seriously not a consent comment
The deepest swamp in the US is the corrupt Trump family - that's the national emergency,Sheikh F Shahel hello
Sheryl Whitfield-Tolliver   love your irony........hahaha  - seriously not a consent comment,Jo Sechi Drugs kill more people than gun related deaths, so does vehicle drunk driving! How much of this countrys drugs come over our borders????? Over 90%!!!!! Several weeks ago tons of Fentanyl was confiscated at the border, enough to kill thousands!!!! Yes, Jo do some fact checking BUT DO it through a reputable source. My advice; Christian based news, Washington media research, call your senator's to keep informed of bills being passed!!!! STOP listening to bias propaganda, it make your debate ridulious.
Ruben Radar Rodriguez your a patriot mate keep it up,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Emily Neal we are discussing the wall.,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.

That blathering idiot obama is the reason this is happening now, the wanna be celebrity did nothing,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Kasha Alverson,do you call housing, feeding ,medical care ,educating the children,ten's of thousands each month a manufactured crises,when does it STOP,we have enough Homeless Americans that we cannot provide for.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
It seems to be doing fine compared to the US.,Rebecca Higgins Meisner you talk to much jackass
Trump and his base need to dial back the name calling. The House has a Democratic majority and Trump won't get a single bill passed if he can't get some Democrats to support him. Calling them "evil" and "dim" isn't likely to work.,Rod Novoa ~ President Trump is the Greatest President in American history. Evil Obama almost destroyed America ~ President Trump is having to clean up the wreck he made!!
You are stuck with her for 2 years, just like we are with Trump.,If we don't defeat Pelosi we cease to be relevant.
No one says the border is, or should be, open. You obviously don't ever cross the border or you would know that.,No other country has open borders why should we
Tom Peden travelling outside the US might give you some perspective.,No other country has open borders why should we
That wall was just a campaign gimmick to remind Trump to talk about immigration at his rallies. He didn't even intend to build a literal wall, but when he tried to back off and say he just meant border security, his base screamed no, we want a real wall. So now he is stuck, being brought down on an issue he didn't even care about.,We voted for Pres Trump, but since he won't build a wall, and shut down the border, we're not sure at this point if we will vote for him !
Trump and his base need to dial back the name calling. Now that the House is under Democratic control he won't get a single bill passed without Democratic help. Calling people "evil" isn't going to work.,I feel so sad that you Mr. President have to take so much from the CORRUPT and EVIL Dems, but I THANK YOU for Putting Our Country FIRST !!!!
Trump loves the ego stroking that comes with the SOTU. All those legislators, Supreme Court justices, honored guests, etc. If he gives a speech somewhere else it is just another speech. He wants the pomp and circumstance that prove he is the President.,President Trump, instead of having the SOTU Address being held in Congress, maybe move it to either the oval office or the southern border itself and stand with Border Agents and Angel Parents.
Source? Maybe among Republicans but no polls show even a majority among the general population.,Trump 2020, he Is our president, has 70 percent approval for the Wall.
Tax cuts for billionaires were more urgent.,He had two years to address this 'critical' issue and did nothing.
Trump and his base need to dial back the name calling. Now that the House is under Democratic control he won't get a single bill passed if he can't get enough Democrats to support him.,Keep everything shut down till you get us that wall ...Screw the democraps
Not much winning so far.,Joel Nash...God bless you
Stick a fork in him?,You‚Äôre well done.
Remember when Trump set up a commission to try to prove that illegal immigrants were voting? They found nothing.,Well, then it is obviously the goal of the democrats to weaken the US from within so that it's easier for them to let in illegal immigrants to vote for them and maintain their power :3
If it wasn't an emergency during the two years when he had GOP majorities in both chambers of Congress, I doubt he can prove it is an emergency now.,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
The wall won't actually help. Everyone wants border security, but the money should be spent on things that will actually work, like more personnel, high tech border surveillance technology, more immigration judges and so on.,Wished I knew what 316 of you morons find so funny, he's exactly right.
That is just a small fraction of the total cost. Trump would have to pitch another tantrum every time the budget comes up for a vote.,The security of our southern border in perspective‚Ä¶. President Trump is asking for 5.7 billion out of an annual budget of 4.407 trillion ‚Ä¶. In other words President Trump is asking for $57 out of an annual budget of $44,070 ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ think about that for a minute. Put that in perspective‚Ä¶. Imagine your wife/husband saying we‚Äôre not going back to work, the kids are not going back to school and no bills are being paid unless you give up the idea of spending $57 to fence in our yard‚Ä¶. This is what Pelosi, Schumer and the democrat obstructionists have halted our government for.
This will be Trump's biggest problem. He is demonizing Democrats, but since the House now has a Democratic majority, he can't get a single bill passed if he can't get any Democrats to vote with him.,Wake up people. The wall between the left and the right in Washington DC is probably the most impermeable wall ever constructed it's not a physical wall but it's definitely an impermeable wall.
And people in Hell want ice water.,Today is my birthday. I'd like a wall to be built please. Thanks!
Lol, right. What are you smoking? Are people going to check a box on their tax forms saying "I oppose the wall, fine me."??,What if Trump fined everyone against his wall like Obama did with obamacare
And please make him smarter. Amen.,Thank you Mr. President Trump. Thank you Lord, please Lord Bless our President to govern this country. Protect him from harm, from evil, Keep him away from danger.  Thank you Lord Amen.
From 2009 through 2014, there was a net loss of Mexicans. More migrants left the US than came here. Who was President back then?,This will help immigrants to realize they have to come legally and safer for them.  Our country will turn into a country the immigrants are leaving if we don't have order
Just because it was a campaign promise doesn't mean it is a good thing to do. If a Democrat promised Medicare for all, do you think Republicans would say "well, it was a campaign promise so let's do it."?,WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO THOSE DEMOCRATS IS STOPPING YOU FROM FULFILLING ONE OF YOUR PROMISES PRESIDENT TRUMP!! THAT'S WHAT YOUR HATERS ARE DOING!! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT BUILDING NO WALL!! THEY JUST HATE YOU FOR TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR AMERICA!! THAT'S IT!! THEY DON'T LIKE THAT NOR DO THEY LIKE YOU!! DON'T EXPECT FOR YOUR HATERS TO SUPPORT YOU & WORK WITH YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!! IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN!! LET'S GET THE WALL BUILT WITHOUT THEM HATERS!! LORD, PLEASE HAVE YOUR WAY & HELP OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU WANT HIM TO ACCOMPLISH IN JESUS NAME,  AMEN!! THANK YOU JESUS!!  :) PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 2020!!  :)
Trump and his base need to dial back the name calling. The House has a Democratic majority and Trump won't get a single bill passed if he can't persuade people to come together on some common sense moderate measures.

Trump and his base need to back off on the name calling. Now that the House is under Democratic control he won't get a single bill passed unless he tries to treat people with respect.,How about Dems have a little respect for our countries security and what made this country great and realize that what they are doing is far from helping THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!
Calm down. Everyone wants border security. We just want the money spent effectively on more personnel, high tech border surveillance technology and so on. Not on a wasteful monument to Trump's vanity.,Phoebe Cassandra Smith it is a matter of security not vanity. Maybe you should leave this conversation to the adults..

Simon Cardinal those are all problems we have to worry about, of course. There's no debate here. the point here is that the wall has nothing to do with the fact that somebody has been killed. the point is that trump is using a specific situation that has nothing extraordinary to prove his point on a global issue. You cant build a point on such an important issue by playing with peoples sentiments using tragedies. En fait c'est simplement de la malhonn√™tet√© int√©lectuelle et cela est une preuve parmis tant d'autre que cet homme exploite les sentiments, les √©motions et des strat√©gies trompeuses dans ses discours afin de contourner toute r√©flexion rationnelle puisque c'est un terrain o√π il s'est av√©r√© √™tre incapable de gagner.,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans

Well I wont be a politician later but yeah it was obviously a statement on the president priorities.

But I guess now it's all about our opinions, values and interpretations of the stats about each of these issues,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans

The order called for the secretary of defense to detain non-citizens accused of international terrorism. The order specifically applies to members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. But it also includes all those who have engaged in, aided, or conspired to commit international terrorist acts against the United States or its citizens.Those who knowingly harbor such individuals are also subject to the order. Under the order, the secretary is charged with establishing military tribunals (also called military commissions) to conduct trials of non-citizens accused of terrorism either in the United States or in other parts of the world.,Thomas Sargent  Only shoot to kill if violence erupts , detain and run back grounds on them ones with violent record , stick in   Guantanamo Bay pending trial by a military court instead of a liberal/democrat circus court.

Thank you for caring enough for the very ones coming against you to ensure their safety as well as those who stand with you. Please Mr. President declare the emergency and build that wall. I work everyday right next to a building housing illegal immagrants for ICE. They are bringing them in by the bus loads. These illegal immagrants are draining the tax payers ability to ever get ahead. If pelosi or any of the other evil ones want to fund them then lets drain their pocketbooks not the average american ctizen.

Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana And you think shooting women and children (and men too) is a better way to stop the illegal crossings would be better than a wall? Maybe you should rethink that.,Ppl ppl ppl ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don‚Äôt yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.

Hmm do you not see the problem with this ?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Steve Martin Your an idiot and probably want socialism  ....,Exploiting a person's death for political gain- is there anything lower? What an incredible scumbag Trump is.
Valentina Hansen I totally agree.  Why are we blowing away $54billion  on countries that could not care less about us.  Use that money to build the wall.,He should not be doing it at the expense of those of us who work in some of the most stressful and dangerous positions that no one else would
Curtis Rice statistically people who give answers with false facts are fools.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Gene Kutina huh?,"Ego is an anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."  Booker T. Washington.
Robert White he is a strong man. I would have cracked long ago. I am grateful that he stands his ground. He makes me proud to be an American.,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
your rigth they are ugly,your rigth they are ugly
It's ashame you feel that way, we as Americans have seen too much crap thrown at us for so long people can no longer see straight. I'm in fear for my kids and everyone else's. And bigotry has nothing to due with my feelings. John Decker answer this please - Bigotry, If someone is accused of bigotry then the accusing party must also be intolerant of the accused persons intolerance; therefore, it is self evident that the term bigot in a sense, can not actually exist in a free society or open debate because of it's self-destructive, self-imploding and hypocritical nature.,Josh your right, but this is no longer about money. The one side hates the other side and will do what ever is needed to destroy our POTUS. Like it or not he's our leader, he beat 16 Republicans and Hillary to get this position. Like it or not, Trump won.

True, Presidents Trumps 289 accomplishments since the election has restored America to greatness. Let‚Äôs not overlook the fact that the world is a safer place since Trump started denuclearization talks with North Korea. No more missiles flying, and North - South Korea in peace talks. The economy booming, millions of jobs, 4 million fewer people on food stamps. Americans can have pride once again, after being ashamed and embarrassed by obama for 8 years.,thanks for saving the country

I FEEL AS THOUGHOUR  PRESIDENT AND  US AMERICANS  WHO ARE  DOING  OUR  BEST  OF  FIGHTING  IMMIGRATION ARE GETTING  NO  HELP  OR  SUPPORT FROM EVEN OUROWN LAWS, POLICE, COURTS  AND/OR  JUDGES.  PRESIDENT  TRUMP  WHY  ARE WE  NOT  GETTING  THE  HELP  WE NEED?
Dave Sienknecht Border busts, Border Patrol agents arrested five men carrying 4 foot tall backpacks with methamphetamine, cocaine and pills over the weekend near Gila Bend. This group was one of 5 groups of smugglers caught by agents in January near Gila Bend. In total, the drugs seized in the incidents was worth about $1.7 million. Customs and Border Protection,The question is, would a wall have stopped this guy from coming here? No, because the vast majority come across ports of entry, not the desert.
Dave Sienknecht nope no way they are coming through the dessert. Really come on, this is a real news report.,The question is, would a wall have stopped this guy from coming here? No, because the vast majority come across ports of entry, not the desert.

Tommy John most likely he will just create another bill to redo the spending, or take the money from another budget.,Its not about the wall, its about that the bill provides amnesty for illegals, limits ICE and hampers our ability to throw the illegals out. I don't know why in gods name he signed that damn thing. Not to mention once again provides an unchecked slush fund to isreal

This article is NOT a plea for a wall but rather more ‚Äúborder security.‚Äù  Every Congress person agrees we need border security.  A wall?  Nah!
John Burks , better phrased as that‚Äôs why prisons still have prisoners in them. There are plenty of drugs and weapons in every prison.,Walls work that's why there is no drugs and weapons in prison
Joseph Nowik , ask Obama, he started it.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Joseph Nowik , unfortunately that won‚Äôt happen in the future. The use of a National Emergency to eliminate the 2nd amendment won‚Äôt happen. Only a fool would try. Global warming seems to be an American thing. The major contributor country‚Äôs haven‚Äôt done a thing to deal with it. Healthcare isn‚Äôt a right. Simply put if a person wants insurance they can buy it. Wether or not they can afford to use it is a different issue.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Kris Landers , they already do hold others responsible. In Drunk driving accidents not only does the driver get sued but also the bar and the server. Same thing for house party‚Äôs.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Ryan VanBuren , very weak argument,Robert Dahlquist  like the ‚Äúemergency‚Äù we are experiencing, check this out...‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt really need to type it out but I wanna do it fast.‚Äù
Tim Koepp , nothing will change until it happens to a politicians family.,No trust me the majority of us we feel for those Angel moms and one was too many this walls going up
Don Januszewski the native american man put himself into that situation ALL BY HIMSELF. The kids WERE NOT bothering him at all. He ever n said it that HE instigated the whole situation. So thus just proves to me that HE IS A LIER AND A SHOULD BE TRUSTED. Also tge kid didn't block him and he was just standing there. My advice there is always 2 sides of the story.,more media fake news..http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=59696&fbclid=IwAR0sPNEQELUeLaKniF9YvhXHlWYaabqtogpj0ZjpTF4C8WwllGjXTRQp9TUHATE HOAX: Native American Activist Approached Chanting Covington Catholic Teens, Got In Their Faceinformationliberation.com
Iris Nielsen you are a idiotical statement. STOP DRINK THE KOOL-AID FROM CNN AND MSNBC ANF BUZZFEED AND ETC.!!!,You took an oath to the American people- to defend our country against all threats both foreign and domestic- right now you Donald J trump are the biggest threat to our country- resign
Shannon Laird they could easily use the 14 billion they confiscated from El Chapo but the corrupt Democrats want to keep that to maybe give it to Saudi Arabia,Robert Day good answer. I can live with that. Totally forgot about the Ted Cruz ace in the hole. Thank you.
Paul Gonzales your just as ignorant as a black man crying about slavery. But I guess you think our civil war was about that majority? So forget about taxation without representation. Oh and forget about plains Indians that tried to live peacefully with the white men. One such group was the Sioux tribe. It was the largest and most powerful group in the west. They signed treaties with the government giving up ninety percent of their land. The Santee agreed to live in a small area. In exchange, the United States agreed to make yearly payments to the tribe. This made it possible for the Indians to buy food and other things from white traders.,mr. Trump you need to stand there at the border with your own gun and your cronies and try to stop trying to stop all the Hispanics to come to United States you got to remember history the Nina and the Pinta who were the first people here on this country and this continent it was the natives natives Americans the Apaches the Indians the Incas and all the other Indians that were raised and born here in United States we are not the only go aliens the ones that came here from the Pinta and the Santa Maria when they landed and found America remember you guys were from England you guys are the foreigners not the Mexicans and not the Indians so if you want to put a border put a border on your ass amen God Bless America the land of the natives and the Hispanics so take that to the bank

Dave Callender.  Don't be asinine.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

That means your stupid ass has to go too, you don't like it here then leave,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Hey Max: Stay in Italy asshole,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
Angel Roy did Mexico pay for it?,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.

Norene Boone Obama care is unconstitutional cram that up your ass,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

GREAT President Donald J. Trump,Fake President.
bs...do you even know what the term means...3-4 victims ...thats  what...take a look at percentages...there are 14 times  the amount of citizens to latinos....350 million to 20 million.....math alone tels you theres going to be more citizens killing ...gangs kill that many on any given weekend.....mass shootings lol...get educated,The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!
what? smh,Trump ur just as bad as cnn. Lets remind the worl how many Americans ate people and buried people . Also many more evil crimes. Lets build a wall is like locking us all in a cell with these American killers. The kkk set nonwhites on fire and tied them to a tree but there able to roam free . Good one trump

i agree except for the whipping, and we do need a wall so we don't waste expenses on them,I believe legislation would be way more effective than a wall.  If there were no benefits, no work, no way to even move around the country and commit crimes, and there was immediate punishment (whipping) and deportation, then we wouldn't have a problem with illegals wanting to be here in the first place.

legally,It's very sad that you lost your child that's horrible. At one time your family were immigrants and needed to come to a better environment to have the necessities for life.
or just walk across because of the lack of other security measures...build the wall,If criminals use Ports of Entry. Why do they dig so many tunnels along the border?
are you really that naive and behind in other current events(except for the hate trump ) that you don't know nk is in russia and chinas hip pocket?,When you said, "I believe Vladimir Putin" regarding the potential of North Korean missiles to hit the US, were you high or out of your mind? Benedict Donald needs to be arrested, interrogated and imprisoned ASAP!
then those countries need to address the fact huh?,USA has killed most people over the world how many Americans cross borders to take advantage of child prostitution and so much to list here that not counting asholes
if the wall would only save 1 life...yours...i'd still fight for it,Send this snake to Satan!
whats GROTESQUE is your opinion...but thats your right,Unconscionable to use one person's tragedy for your own political gain. Even worse to give this man false hope. Because of Trump, this man will feel responsible for additional deaths caused by illegal aliens  when he learns more people will suffer loss like he did (when statistics demonstrate that the resources wasted on the wall could have saved countless others) if only America would have invested in alternative and far better protections than a wall. In addition, this poor Dad will be no closer to bringing his daughter back. Trump is literally compounding this man's tragedy for his political gain. GROTESQUE!
sometimes by the wisdom of force,Triumph comes not by force but by wisdom. A strong wave will bring ruin to what it touches but in its wake you've discovered a cleansing of the shores...
and we have laws against it and enforce them,How many legal citizens kill people in the United states daily?
coming over the border illegally at the rate of 60,000 a month...and not "mexicans" but all illegals, drugs, human traffickers ...it's a very big concern. are you saying we don't have laws and are not enforcing them for your concerns? or programs in place for those in need?,How many kids are killed from school shootings? How many people die from poverty and not being able to afford their medicine? Didn't 16000 veterans kill themselves this year?? But yes the Mexicans are our country's main concern. Idiots.
a man...race has nothing to do with nothing except for racists,How many kids are killed from school shootings? How many people die from poverty and not being able to afford their medicine? Didn't 16000 veterans kill themselves this year?? But yes the Mexicans are our country's main concern. Idiots.

My grandmother and grandfather both came to this country legally. I support Trump and I support the wall. We welcome anyone, just do it the right way, the legal way. I don't understand why people have such a hard time with that.
or you for defending him?,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
and we enforce the laws and arrest and sentence them,Not trying to be rude but Americans do that all the time either drinking and driving or texting and driving causes accidents
they all do,As thousands of AMERICANS struggle due to the shutdown. Way to go, Mr. President! You‚Äôve sure left your mark now.  I sympathize in the Angel families and believe we need to secure our borders. But what about those that are about to be evicted because they already live paycheck to paycheck?   Despicable!
and you have never done anything bad in yours,Ronald Bettney good work my ass.
at least the dem side...repub sides on solid ground,The house will fall
and theyre on a steady increase now...60,000 a month,Why didn't Trump build a wall two years ago when he had a majority in Congress...Because it was not an emergency. Illegal border crossings and apprehensions have been declining for nearly two decades, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and in 2017 were at their lowest point since 1971. A 2018 study published by the Cato Institute found that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the majority of illegal drugs coming into the country across the southern border are being smuggled through legal points of entry. In other words, this president has manufactured an immigration crisis for his own political gain.
you should have been more up to date on current affairs then and you would know why...smh,Why didn't Trump build a wall two years ago when he had a majority in Congress...Because it was not an emergency.

keep up with the times , we enforce the laws and prosocute them.do some research . we have gun control.but we wont tolerate a gun ban,Gee..dont you people stay up with news? We have had more shootings in America by white Supremists than by Hispanic immigrants..do some research..you will find that a wall is not going to solve your problems....how about gun control...? Ever think about that?
thats something both parties would agree on but it must be a united country first,Ron O'Hearn   Thanks for commenting But can you be More specific???  I wouldn't agree if our prime Minister gets Marco Rubio and tells and says you are going to be the PRESIDENT!!!! Just because 40 countries  agree to  that!  While Mr Trump still is the PRESIDENT!!!  That would NOT BE JUST IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND MUCH MORE.
it'd be easier to just get rid of you,Can we build a wall around every White American Male, you know just in case they decide to go nuts and shoot up a church, school, concert, etc??

Veronica Torres, What Do you mean by they??? By the way are you Hispanic? If you are, I just hope that you are kind, to the undocumented immigrants, because sometimes they can experience the worst cruelty from their own kind.!!!,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
John n Morris and maybe you need to call 1 866 go Jack off!,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.

Timothy Norton well I`am from europe and President Trump is 100% correct about most european countrys not spending 2% on defence as for the southern border or any border in any country for that matter,you can`t have people wandering about coming and going as they please,from what I have read there is a huge volume of drugs comes into the USA through the southern border,if true thaat alone would be good enough reason for a wall even here in europe it has been a absolute disaster all the migrants getting in and allowed to wander unchecked ,just two days ago a afghan mirgrant stabbed a pregnant woman in hospital they managed to save the woman ,but the baby iis dead,Timothy Norton well I`am from europe and President Trump is 100% correct about most european countrys not spending 2% on defence as for the southern border or any border in any country for that matter,you can`t have people wandering about coming and going as they please,from what I have read there is a huge volume of drugs comes into the USA through the southern border,if true thaat alone would be good enough reason for a wall even here in europe it has been a absolute disaster all the migrants getting in and allowed to wander unchecked ,just two days ago a afghan mirgrant stabbed a pregnant woman in hospital they managed to save the woman ,but the baby iis dead
Joe Stark what a small comment.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
It's a fake emergency.  The facts say illegal immigrants are far more likely to come by plane not Southern borders.  The wall is nothing more than a dog whistle to bigoted supporters that just want a fight to coverup Trumps other legal issues,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.

Gary Kane you cant possibly be that stupid.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
But it will be much,much harder.Every country who has a wall say their illegal's have dropped from 50-95% success rate.Israel is at 99%.He is on the front lines we just have news to go by,and some choose to listen and salivate to fake news..And those who believe in God and his word the bible,it's in many a scripture.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Jo-Ann Machinist Cassidy not Americans, Russians.,62,000,000 American‚Äôs voted for Trump, if we all send a check for 10$ would that cover the building of the wall?
Best President we have ever had,Rod Novoa people like you should be stripped of their citizenship and food and out of this country. That is if you have citizenship you're probably one of those New Yorkers that de Blasio takes a liking to

Camille Ortiz Marroquin oh ffs go sit down...,Eric Wroblewski thank you
If we would stop paying the illegals that are already here, the ones held at the border we could..  You are paying congress and the illegals becky lao,,  unless your on welfare..  then we're paying for you also..,Americans overwhelmingly know you‚Äôre a fake
why do you think we need a wall,, they don't just come through the airports ya know..  tell it congress..,Right now we need security at our airports where we are actually stopping thousands on our terror list. Agents aren‚Äôt being paid.  You sir are a fraud.   Do us a favor and crawl back into your reality tv hole    You make a piss poor human.

Teresa Collins Batchelor Presidents have been giving the State of the Union address in person only about 100 years. There is no requirement that it be done in person.  Pelosi is just showing her ASS.  Text, call, or write her and tell her what you just posted!,I have a question, you are require to give congress a state of the union address but Representative Pelosi has stated that is her house and because of security reason you can give it. (It's Americans house but we won't go there for now). Why can't  you address the other chamber of congress? Send her the address on paper like she wanted but give the address from the Senate floor.  How can she stop that.  She doesn't control that.  If she wants to be left out it's on her. Heck let her go on her trip then

James Ahssanipoor  How come you never answered my question in my comment. It's such a simple question. Stop sidestepping it. Who'd ya vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? Did you like where this country was heading? Men using the bathroom with your wife and daughter? Which Obama accomplishments do you consider to be his best?  I'm curious. Hillary would have continued down the same roads, but I'll ask the question again. Who'd ya vote for and why? Surely you have a reason?,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
James Ahssanipoor  I was talking about Hillary Clinton's records that were stored on a private server in her basement. Try to keep up. You're a CFO. You should pay more attention to detail... You know...the ones that were on all those smashed e-mail servers? But we all know those 33,000 deleted e-mails that would incriminate her was only an accident.  I mean..... that kind of stuff is ALWAYS happening to folks. Right? Geeeeezzzzzaloo.. to be CFO and NEVER work, you sure come up with some goofball comments! Just sayin....,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.

Sorry Chammy Ney Ney Jr..  I tagged the wrong peson...This question is intended for James Ahssanipoor. So here it is ole buddy.   James thinks Hillary Clinton did NOT have textual relations with that server.  I mean........ anyone could accidentally delete 33,000 e-mails that would incriminate them. Right? He wants Hillary Clinton back in the white house with Bill Clinton by her side. That way Bill coud have wild passionate monkey love in the oval office on TAXPAYER'S money. Hey James. .. Did you know that Monica Lewinsky had a birthday recently? She's in her 50's now. It seams like only yesterday that she was crawling around the white house floor putting anything she could find in her mouth. They grow up so quickly these days. Don't ya think so James? Hillary Clinton will screw over America in a Benghazi minute.... but just answer this question James.... If you didn't vote for Trump,  who'd ya vote for and why? That's a VERY simple question. A simple answer will do just fine.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.

I'm done with him. I've asked 5 times.  He obviously doesn't want to put a comment statement on here..... because he doesn't know how to answer the question. It's EXACTLY what I expected.... and EXACTLY why I continued to ask. It was to prove a point. I've done that. So y'all have a nice day. I've got to get out my 4 wheel drive John Deere tractor I paid cash for and grade the snow off my 7/10 mile long driveway into my farm here in Kentucky... so my wife can get her Chrysler 300 M out of the garage and make it up to the guest house. Dang! I just wish I had that CFO money that ole James Ahssanipoor makes. That way I could pay someone to do that for me. That dude says he NEVER has to work because he's obviously rich. You know....  being CFO and trader and all. He's not conceited either! He's just convinced! BAHAHAHAHA  You've at least been VERY cheap entertainment James. Have a nice day sir. üòÇ,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
I've read every one of them. ALL that I asked for is for you to say I voted for....   Because...... But I guess that's just too difficult for a CFO that says they NEVER work. It actually requires a minimum amount of WORK. Really not difficult. You're just not willing to answer the question because I'll make you look stupid.  Too late pal. By NOT answering. You already do.  Just sayin.....,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
James Ahssanipoor  STILL circling the airport. You said who cares about Hillary. That's something we agree on. I didn't want her back in the white house either. That's why I voted for Trump. So I'm gonna ask another time. Who did you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? It's such a simple question. How come you're not willing to answer the question? A smart CFO like yourself shouldn't have a bit of problem coming up with a very quick answer. How come it's taking so long....you never answered my question?,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
James Ahssanipoor  When are you going to stop circling the airport and land the plane? I've asked you a VERY simple question 3 times. I'll ask it again. Who did you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? Your CFO of your company. Surely it ain't gonna be that hard for you to answer. So stop sidestepping it. Ya want to stop circling the airport and bring it in for a landing? Who'd you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why?,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.

As a mother who lost her child at the hands of failed immigration policies, I know just how important border security is to American families.  I watched my son, Javier Vega, Jr., gunned down by two illegal aliens who viciously ambushed our family while we were on a fishing trip in Texas.  Javier served his country as both a Border Patrol Agent and a U.S. Marine, but he spent his last moments bravely defending my family from these ruthless animals.  Any mother who has lost a child in this way can attest that there is nothing more gut-wrenching than knowing that their sacrifice was entirely avoidable.  Politicians had neglected their responsibility to keep my son safe by ignoring our country‚Äôs desperate need for immigration reform for decades.  Three years ago, Donald Trump gave new hope to every American family like mine that has lost a loved one at the hands of illegal aliens who never should have been allowed into the country in the first place. ‚ÄúI hear you, I see you, and I will never let you down,‚Äù he promised us.  Since then, President Trump has never wavered from his promise to protect our families by building a wall on the southern border.  When the media ignored us, he listened. When the politicians mocked us, he comforted us.  Because he understood how failed immigration policies destroyed our families, he brought our stories to the forefront of the public consciousness and fought tirelessly to make our plight known.  President Trump gave a voice to Javier and the countless others whose lives were taken by illegal immigrants, and I am forever grateful to him for that.  But Javier‚Äôs story is just one of many that never made the headlines and likely would have gone unheard and unaddressed if not for the President‚Äôs unrelenting commitment to fix our broken system.  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to see this fight through to the end. We cannot let another child become collateral damage of the reckless open-border agenda.  Of all the promises President Trump has made and followed through on, fixing our broken immigration system is the most important.  In my home state of Texas alone, over a quarter million criminal aliens have been arrested and charged with over 600,000 crimes in just the past seven years.  My family paid the ultimate price for the failed immigration policies that allowed these crimes to happen, and I owe it to my son to demand accountability from the elected officials whose indifference cost him his life.  I am not alone. The majority of Americans overwhelmingly oppose illegal immigration and want a safer country. That‚Äôs why we elected Donald Trump to be our President.  He‚Äôs always had our backs, and now we want him to know that we have his.  President Trump, now more than ever, we support you in your battle to resolve our border crisis before more American families experience the tragedy mine has had to endure.  Marie Vega is a proud mother of two sons who served in the US Marine Corps. One was Border Patrol Agent Javier ‚ÄúHarvey‚Äù Vega Jr. and the other is mineral well engineer, Jordy Vega. She works as a bookkeeper at a local law firm.,Eh Dipshit, Open the Government and pay them now ! Stop negotiating using the lives and livelihood of Federal employees  !

No the majority of Americans want a wall. Technology so far hasn't stopped the illegal aliens. That's like someone walking into your house while you leave the door open, but the alarm system and CCTV will stop them. Dumbass,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Stay strong yourself. I‚Äôve been wondering how people affected view the issue, as that‚Äôs what matters. God bless. If necessary, find another as this might take awhile.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Brent Robinson wrong trumps ratings are down and any thing hes says or does is for his ratings,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Norene: Obama held the American's hostage for Obamacare. He then overreached his power & signed into law the DACA program which is an illegal program. Anything to do with immigration must be passed by Congress not by EO...They wouldn't pass it so he basically said "screw you I'm signing an EO for it". You asked if walls would protect someone. Do your fences protect you? Do your doors protect you? Why do you have them then if you feel these aren't protecting you? I grew up in Nogales, AZ...Believe me it is in a crisis situation.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Wendi DelValle Im so sorry for your loss. Lets hope this wall gets built. Maybe it should be engraved with the names of all the lives that have been lost because we didn‚Äôt have it.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Joel Bernardini u r a sad person to be wasting you time on here with this remark'- I suppose if your child had been killed from some one illegal - u would be more respectable.,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they‚Äôve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Dave Callender that's a nice picture of you and your sister.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Loyda M. Riley Yes!!!!  He IS the biggest snake in the swamp.  He continues to lie and his supporters are so full of hatred and anger towards those who are different and/or have different point of views, that they will swallow all he says without even checking for truth  I always check what either party states because I learned long ago that ANY media and ANY politician can twist words and information around ..... as i've seen this myself......it is just so sad how they are allowing him to treat them like unintelligent children, manipulated for control....feel sorry for them,You socialist communists prove how stupid half of America is
Sherry Carruth it doesn't matter to him....just look at his responses...he's so full of anger and cannot even have an adult conversation or debate.  As for the snowflake, everyone already knows that those who must hold rallies for the sole purpose of whining about people who are mean to them and look for praises and to be coddled by cheers, are the biggest snowflakes of them all.,You socialist communists prove how stupid half of America is
Kelly Dunham Hardin so what is your proposition for all those illegals flying in here?  if you are truly concerned of illegals....why aren't you fighting for the president to stop those coming in with their f1/j1 visas?  you do know those are the ones who take our higher paying jobs, right?  they speak more than one or even two languages,,,,they take high paying jobs from us easily....you think that's right?,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don‚Äôt support it. Don‚Äôt say we.
he said mexico AND canada are already paying for it through the new deal...it's on his very own twitter page...so why is he holding the government hostage?  oh right, because he's a coward and doesn't know how to negotiate.  he's afraid to let the bill pass onto the senates (which is republican controlled) and have them vote on it  because he's afraid to have a veto under his belt... BTW...Dan....the ones who cross the border to work....they are taxed social security....a tax they can never see as non-citizens....being that we do not have enough social security, they're contribution is helping to keep us afloat on this....use your brain and do some real research like an actual government site....or even a library,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Mike Neary reworking immigration policies is not the same as banning guns...however, adding new walls is most definitely like banning guns, and as you already stated, people will find a way.    There are reasons why certain sections remain open...and obviously we will always have a budget to repair/replace those that are already there.  A more advanced system is what is needed..perhaps even hire more border patrol along these sections.    We have illegals coming in from other means and they eventually take our high paying jobs from Americans.  This is something no one is even discussing.  I've seen this happen myself, and it's far easier by plane.    I don't understand why we cannot have a new system at eh airports where tourists are registered into the system....make sure they have a return flight ticket...make sure they show where they will be staying (hotel reservations helps), monitor college students making sure they do not stay continue to stay once they have graduated,Rachel- You have proven my point.

There are many better ideas. A wall won't stop the tunnels nor will it stop the fentanyl thats flying in fromChina.,We need something!! Build wall.......  Unless someone has a better idea..  Has nothing to do as to if you like Trump or not.. We need wall
Of course we care. But some of us seem better informed and know that fentanyl is flying in from China and that most drugs are intercepted at legal entry points. Trump is lying.,It's a shame you have to do all this for something that  as everyone can see is wrong do they not see the gangs in California or the pictures of the drugs that's caught at the border not just because you in office you the one trying to fix this...it's crazy they want it to stay the same....Do Americans care about America?
He came through a tunnel and he was selling fentanyl that flew in from China.,How did that illegal get here?
Beto knows the truth.,Some people dont want to hear the truth...bet on Beto as one of them...
Not true. 50 people dead so far this year from American citizens shooting each other up. We know what the real emergency is. Most violent crime is not perpetrated by illegal immigrants. Trump just loves to exploit these anecdotal stories when it does happen though.,So much blood on the left and media's hands.  Up to God who they will one day explain it to or not.  I can't judge he reserves that right.  Funny they can't even see the truth. He wins again.
Exactly. Or the 5 shot dead in Illinois yesterday.,How about the parents from Parkland shooting!?!?

Jerry Matthews Smith I am gonna take that as a no since you did it not once but twice. How about throwing some of those facts you claim you know. PS I have read both.

Jerry Matthews Smith were you not capable of arguing Ryan's comment on what he said?,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited

Victoria A. Deobald what on Earth is the matter with you people seriously I don't listen I mean you do but only to the idiot who doesn't bother to like know anything or check facts or any of those cool things before he speaks. Seriously Trump can't expose anyone for anything because it would require paying attention to someone other then himself. Aslo Trudeau is a self admitted globalist. Try paying attention next time,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!

Norene Boone  love my President WE HAVE ONE SINGLE MAN who has attempted to solve a problem that predated him being in the White House. We have one single man who fights every day for Americans against all the elite, deep state Washington insiders owned by lobbyists! Thank you President Trump,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Fay Johnson for sure. Well God would never listen to a prayer like that.,Mike Holub so sad you saying something like that

Suiter Kaye oh I read yesterday that Elon Musk helped Flint. Musk 2020,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that‚Äôs where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don‚Äôt see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That‚Äôs unacceptable.  Anyway, I‚Äôm done discussing it.  If üá∑üá∫ doesn‚Äôt interfere,  üòâ I‚Äôm sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
Angela Wilson is that all, you just made America feel like heaven, the way you criticized those European countries, your police force kills their own children, I mean if they see blacks as theirs, i don't hear stories like that in others countries,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.

Norene Boone I pay 740. A month and only  pays for half my medical bills no scripts no dental no vision .this needs to stop.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Jeanie Railsback, I lost my husband too, and he also died here at home. He was a Veteran from Vietnam era and evidently the VA got his records mixed up with someone that served in Afghanistan. He didn't believe me when I told him that I didn't think that the VA Hospital was really trying to help him until about a month or so before he passed away. We didn't have insurance either because we couldn't afford it and be able to live day to day.    To many foreign doctors working there with their own agendas. I don't believe that they have the lives of our Veterans and their families as top priority for surviving.    The Democrats always thought that the WALL should be built until Trump promised to see that one actually would be built. I think that a feasiblity study should have been done as to what the WALL should be built out of etcetera and how to use technology to help with patrolling and monitoring the border before doing a slapdash project.,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.

Danny Jones you need to go educate yourself, and have all the facts checked! Please!,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
I won't deny the fact that America has a gun problem, though we can't act like illegal immigration isn't an issue.  While not every immigrant is a threat to society, we cannot deny the fact some of them are, even if they're a minority. Some are even wanted criminals.  Not to mention that if Orange-man were to actually implement stricter firearm control, there would still be a lot of contraband crossing the border because of the lack of immigration control. Not just drugs, but unlicensed weapons as well.  They're basically fuel for the black market which puts unlicensed weapons in the wrong hands. this in itself is valid reason to encourage possession of a firearm to protect one's self against this threat.  I think that fixing (or at least minimizing) the contraband problem is the first step towards implementing a better, more efficient gun control project since the population will feel more secure.  Whether building a wall is the best solution is up for debate. On the surface it looks extreme, but we won't know its efficiency until it's finalized. Until then, people will have a valid argument to defend both the second amendment and the wall. Pierre-Luc Vachon,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans
That I can agree on. I guess I misinterpreted your first post and I apologize for the misunderstanding.   Though we might not agree on everything, I respect your views and knowing you're a future politician, I'll give you this advice to help you on your path.  The ironic tone of your comment made it sound like you were making a statement on the president's priorities instead of him pushing propaganda. Some might have understood your position, but I think your comment is open to a lot of misinterpretations.  Nothing's wrong with irony or humor of course, though clearly stating your position is a must in this day and age (especially considering everyone takes everything as an attack nowadays). Hope this can be of some help for your future career. :3,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans

Mike Sikora yeah! You're comments are devoid of both truth and facts!,Democrats are so hell bent on trying to make Trump fail but what are they doing in return to make this country better? Right now, absolutely nothing. Don't blame Trump for the shutdown. Blame the House for not passing a bill that will not pass the Senate.  Turnabout is fair play. The democrats refused to make the necessary votes to pass a bill that the House (when republicans had the House) and now the Senate republicans are saying "No". Kinda sucks when the other teams is using your playbook against you.

Ok ppl are getting paranoid here,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Charles Landry this is not proof of need for a wall. Illegal immigration happens primarily through Visa overstays and the other issues we have with border security are also largely through ports of entry. This is intended to bolster unthinking response by people who have poor critical thinking skills. It is transparent fear mongering.,Who exactly??? Because stats don't support a barrier wall.

Ruben Radar Rodriguez    Drusilla Morrison read this post please.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Angela Harris I agree,  and I see it all the time with our schools,You can get arrested for hunting and fishing without a license, why are the illegals allowed to work and stay in America without being cleared.

waiting 2 years to declare an emergency is hardly addressing an emergency if he waited until after he didnt get his own way to call it , he just needs to keep his base happy so he gets a second term,WHY is declaring a National Emergency to address a National Emergency in The United States considered wrong? There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, "homes of the rich and famous‚Äù and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers"  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year." (* 2017, FAIR's)  This does not include cost of loss of life, property, and Democratic stability.

Raphael Pulman  This is very insightful about the European Union (EU) government.  """ Dear Mr. Temple, Thank you for your supportive email. The EU president was not elected into his post and is meant to be the face of 450 million people in Europe.  There is no mechanism to remove him and no way, through the ballot box, that the people of Europe can hold him to account.  The European Union is a undemocratic and corrupt organisation that tries to force us to accept one EU currency, one EU flag and one EU state without the consent of the people. It is my job to fight against this and be the voice of free speech - again thank you for your kind message. Yours sincerely, Nigel Farage" """,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

The Emoluments Clause, US Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 ‚ÄúAlso known as the Title of Nobility Clause, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution prohibits any person holding a government office from accepting any present, emolument, office, or title from any "King, Prince, or foreign State," without congressional consent. This clause is meant to prevent external influence and corruption of American officers by foreign States. A similar provision was included in the Articles of Confederation, applicable to both federal and state officers. The language of the modern clause, however, suggests that only federal government officials are prohibited from accepting any emoluments. That the phrase "Offices of Profit or Trust under the United States" applies to all appointed officials is undisputed, however there is much debate as to whether it extends to elected officials. History does not provide a clear answer: When he served as Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton produced a list of persons holding such offices at the request of the Senate; the list did not include any elected positions. Further, during their presidencies, while George Washington did not seek or obtain congressional consent for foreign gifts, Andrew Jackson did. The Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act of 1966, on the other hand, enumerates several elected positions in its definition of "employees" who may not accept any gift of more than minimal value without congressional approval. Such "employees" include the President and the Vice President, a Member of Congress, and the spouses and dependents of the same. A constitutional amendment was introduced in 1810 to modify the Emoluments Clause. The effect would have been to strip the citizenship of any U.S. citizen who accepted, claimed, received, or retained any title of nobility from a foreign government. However, this amendment was never ratified, though it is technically still pending before the states. The interpretation of the Emoluments Clause has never been litigated before the U.S. Supreme Court.‚Äù https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/emoluments_clause,What part of "trump and his supporters" did you not understand?

Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

This Man we call our President, has suffered more from people like you than any President of the United States of American ever should...   We do Love him and we love the fact he is going the job no other has ever done before.  We Will Stand together or Fall.  This is for U, President Donald J. Trump.  Amen,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...
and would love to meet my girls Diamond and Silk,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...
Noble Loria I'm so afraid that you are right on this one.,Trump start out by saying let‚Äôs build a wall. Are you a Trump supporters cheered him on. Now Trump is saying let‚Äôs finish the wall. Again all you Trump supporters are cheering him on.   He hasn‚Äôt even started to build the wall. But now you guys are cheering him on to finish it.  All Trump has to do is say he finish the wall.  You Trump supporters walk again cheer him on.  So why doesn‚Äôt he just do that.  All this nonsense will be over.
He is the president of the USA. If a wall is a national emergency than so is Flint.  Everybody is so democratic & so republican that no one looks at the big picture.   The U. S coast guard is working without pay!   Y‚Äôall assume that everyone that disagrees with you is a democrat. Trumpster logic.   If I wasn‚Äôt a democrat before best believe I‚Äôll be voting blue in 2020.  Regardless of your political leanings Trump is one of the worst things to happen to this country in a loooooong time.,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that‚Äôs where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don‚Äôt see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That‚Äôs unacceptable.  Anyway, I‚Äôm done discussing it.  If üá∑üá∫ doesn‚Äôt interfere,  üòâ I‚Äôm sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
lol if you think that‚Äôs a mic drop. I‚Äôll let you have it.   I‚Äôm more concerned with why we have a president who thinks a wall is of the utmost importance when his own press secretary has admitted that threat is entering by airport & why people are working & not being paid.,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that‚Äôs where the threat is?

We need to put the money where your heart is . Here in America‚ù§,Wasn't Mexico supposed to pay for the wall
Joseph Nowik  Juarez mexico is one of the most dangerous cities look it up . Its behind our border and if them walls are not fully secure or they come down thier dangerous city will be part of our country because they can walk over . Think about that ! Think about your family to be safe.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Larry Burford what does that have to do with this . So you want more killing to enter the US while we have enouph of our own . Juarez mexico is on the list of the most dangerous cities behind our border . You are really thinking crazy ! The border isnt even secure there either . If the walls come down they become part of our country . Think about that . They can walk right over .,More Americans with guns kill Americans than immigrants your gun laws needs to be sorted first
Dennis Coughlan sssssshhhhhh,How are democrats stopping you from building a wall you said Mexico would pay for? Is it because you lied and are now trying to stick American tax payers with the $25 billion dollar wall. Your stupid wall idea only covers a small percentage of the country and does absolutely nothing to stop the 40% of immigrants that fly in. Your $25 billion dollar wall will do nothing to stop illegal immigration. Why dont you just be honest and admit you know how to embezel and extort a ton of money from this wall project.
Adria Jackson absolutely blatant!!! Everything they do is because they hate trump. It‚Äôs not for the American people.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.

They pay NO social security.  They don't even have legal Social Security cards.  Idiot!!!,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.

Any ideas or just more bitching cause your candidate lost...,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Okay Stephen. According to the way we elect presidents in the United states, we elected a president. This president's name is Trump. I don't care who or who doesn't like him. We, the United states of America, have a president. The people, according to years of tradition, have elected Trump as that president. Work harder at getting a viable democratic president.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
Stephen Pierson how do you know the majority? Did we take it to a vote? ..... oh that's right..... we did.... we elected a president who put that as his campaign promise.... I see both sides and have friends in both sides.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.

Thank you Albert, you are a smart man! I like him too!!! Great President!!!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Cally Schneider no not really I see lots of people listing accomplishments of the President and actually the whole post is about him trying to stop illegal immigration,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Kris Landers What an idiot u r,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
no she doesn't love trump the fat baby man,#WALKAWAY
Chris McCarthy There is NO crisis at the Border.  It's been proven.  He said on TV that he will #trumpshutdown the government and take credit for it.  Did he lie to YOU when he claimed Mexico would pay for the wall?  100%  ---  There has been deals...deals that he refuses to sign.  Deals he refuses to sign because of right wing media.  He is getting most of the blame for this shutdown.  And rightly so.,I'm impressed President Trump that you haven't called a national emergency yet.. When will the Demos wake the F up. Stay strong President Trump
Cinda Beinert  he‚Äôs protecting ignorant people like you I got bills to pay üí∞ and am working for free ok enough with the fucking bullshit and tell your president to pay me my money,John Baron the pay is indirect- and he has kept more campaign promises than any other politician in my lifetime

As soon as the Dems took the house, he called it an Emergency  ..lol  The house and the senate agreed on a budget  deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!   The Trump administration tried to dismantle DACA, that shields approximately 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation, in the fall of 2017, but a prolonged court battle has kept the initiative alive. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also announced the eventual termination of TPS protections for more than 250,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Honduras, Sudan and Haiti, but a federal judge blocked the decision in early October.  Now he says he‚Äôll give a temporary stay for them, something he took away.. for his 5.7 none border he PROMISED and GARENTEEED ! Mexico would pay for... lol ‚Ä¶ yes more barriers where immigration says it needs, not 5.7 billion for his dumb wall, MAJOIRTY of drugs come in cars at ports of entry, FACT!,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
FACT: Majority of Americans blame trump for shutdown, he even said it was him on TV, trump had majority of the house and senate, did nothing for 2 yrs., but give himself a huge tax cut, As soon as the Dems took the house, he called it an Emergency  ..lol  The house and the senate agreed on a budget  deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!   Now he says hill give the same thing he took away, 2 yrs ago, DACA & TPS  offering temporary protection from deportations for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall funding for 5.7, for his NONE WALL he promised Mexico would pay for...lol ( not a compromise ) and makes up a crises, Majority of drugs come at ports of entry FACT!,Thank you America for electing him üåüüíØüå∑‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üíãüá∫üá∏

Don't you need passport to visit other countries,No other country has open borders why should we
Melody Hutchison Really and what type of Pres do you think Obama was. Trump hasn't cut off benefits for those who need it. Medicare and Medicaid both received Raises and so did SS and SSI.,He's not ever going to change.  I'm not ever going to forgive his cowardice cutting off benefits for the people who really need it. I'm a 49 year old who has had back surgery and I'm going to have to have neck surgery soon. I can't ever hold a job cause I can't sit down or walk very much.  He's the worst president ever including all the republicans.

The shutdown is democrats now. Putting politics before people.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Jim Cavo Gaff theres 33million undocumented illegals you and I support, and not by choice!,To those liberals who say a couple thousand illegals crossing is not bad, how many would you consider a problem? 10,000? 100,000?  1 for me is too much, are you personally going to sponsor any of them?  I bet NO, why is that?
Addy Means Elizabeth Warren gave hers up! To a refugee/ asylum seeker foundation but she did give it up. SMH Right after she said Trump's shut down is keeping 800,000 Americans from being paid so I am donating my paycheck to illegals! OK how does that help Americans not getting paid??  They have lost their minds, or they have never really been heard before.,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Shirley Terry Harrow power and greed are evil things.,If, this touched Nancy‚Äôs family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy‚Äôs heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Angela Maria how will the wall fail to stop illegals. Yes, a few will get through, but right now, you can just walk up to an imaginary line and toss your unwanted child into another country.  OUR children and young women are also taken across that line and sold into slavery. So, tell us, oh wise one, why the wall won't stop people?  Do the walls in your house not reduce your access to entries and exits?,I feel terrible for these families and I also feel terrible for families that lost their children just because they went to school...there is a gun crisis in this country and that needs addressing...the wall wont do anything to prevent illegals, get real
Cindy Cripps-Prawak Nancy could end this, but she has some important stuff to do first. Just think about that a minute,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Gary Kane you mean the two wasted years spent looking for Boris Badinoff, Natasha, and their influence on my vote? Two YEARS we have been paying for that. What did we get for our money? Nothing.

Maureen Ryan Two years you people have been chasing the Russians. So, tell me, WHAT did the Russians do to influence your vote? Did you see something that we missed?  Tell us, what EXACTLY are you looking for? The FBI can't find it, the CIA can't either, Pelosi can't say what it is, neither can MSM. What are you looking for? Please tell.,Let's see how many lies can be told in 8 minutes! Everyone should FACT CHECK this idiot when he's done. Oh and Manadort conspiring with the Russians....imagine that as idiots campaign chair ...again imagine that!!!  Maybe idiot should build a wall around himself...oh wait the WALLS r closing in on him.

Was just at the border to drop off family at PCT start. And it was crazy to see the wall there in person.  Down by Campo CA.  We need the Border protected. Thank you for fighting the good fight for all of us that agree with you.
Charlesetta Brown they are more than welcome IF they come in legally.  The problem is, the ones that don't come legally.  They have no right to be here period.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Dawn Duff what is pointless is spending over 100 billion dollars a year of taxpayer money on people that have no legal right to be here.  Why aren't you crying about sending billions of OUR tax dollars to Jordan to build THEIR pointless wall?,More people are killed by American citizens than immigrants,the wall is pointless
Nancy Harris are you also complaining about the billions of taxpayer dollars sent to Jordan to build THEIR wall?,I just do NOT understand they level of insanity in people that think this is not necessary
Dylan Shaw so how many come in undetected?  No way to get accurate numbers.,20% of illegal immigration comes in through Mexico, and a wall won't stop half of that.  Logical legislation is need, not a stupid wall.
Estefania Torres Restrepo so how does anyone accurately determine how many people or the amount of drugs have came into the US undetected?  That's right, you can't.  The argument of most/majority and legal ports of entry is just guesswork trying to be passed off as fact. A wall is a deterrent, along with the increased border enhancements.  They go hand in hand in preventing the illegal crossing of the border.  Come in legally, they are more than welcome.  Come in  illegally, no.   Opinions are not facts.,You‚Äôre disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Joan Hamilton it doesn't matter why he was illegal.  The fact that he had no legal right to be here is enough!,Sympathies to the family but the odds of her being killed by a mass shooter in school, or by a drunk American are statistically higher than what happened here.   The courts failed long before he got to her.   There is nothing in these articles that say why he was illegal, just that he was suspected of being illegal.  Did he overstay a visa?  Is he a DACA kid?    Too many unknowns.
Joseph Tewell so how's your tax dollars that are being sent to Jordan to build THEIR wall helping you?,Ya my tax dollars going for a wall thats not going to stop them
Lee Mcclelland so we shouldn't have a wall to make it easier for them?,Because a person willing to kill people is going to look at a wall and say ‚Äúoops, look at that ... getting past this would be illegal, I should stop here.‚Äù
Noble Loria so according to your logic, the live Facebook streams of the past week or so, at the border where the area is going from wide open area to an area that has a wall is fake?  Ohhhhhhkay.,Trump start out by saying let‚Äôs build a wall. Are you a Trump supporters cheered him on. Now Trump is saying let‚Äôs finish the wall. Again all you Trump supporters are cheering him on.   He hasn‚Äôt even started to build the wall. But now you guys are cheering him on to finish it.  All Trump has to do is say he finish the wall.  You Trump supporters walk again cheer him on.  So why doesn‚Äôt he just do that.  All this nonsense will be over.
Paul Karachia if we didn't have to spend over 100 billion every year on illegals, more could be spent to help the citizens! Walls don't work?  If you come to a wall you have 4 choices... Go over it, go under it, go around it, go back the same way you came.  Anything is better than nothing! Slow them down so border patrol can get there to apprehend.,Mr president wall don't work , that's a waste of funds, take care of the veterans. This way you will always be great.
Pierre-Luc Vachon how's that gun control working out in Chicago?  Crime is UP since they started it there.,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans
Flint was given millions of dollars by Obama, if it's not fixed that's on Flints government.,So what makes you think a damn wall will keep out illegals?

Even having the money that has been confiscated doesn't automatically allocate it to that particular budget funding. It must still be approved by congress no matter where the money comes from. Doesn't haven't to be the specific taxpayer money, how much did Obama send Iran again? Oh yeah, it was billions as well of our taxpayer money. As a government employee household of 35 years I can assure you first hand the government wastes far more than that just in idle hand-wrenching and not making a decision? Why didn't they fix this crap when they had control for so many years exactly? Do you know? They don't want to for their own agenda's and now more than ever simply because of stupid blind hate of Trump for no real actual reason any worse than anything any other president has ever done in their lifetime. Kennedy was a womanizer if that's your beef and everyone knew it, but overlooked it. Character issues, let's don't trot out all of Bill's as we just don't have that much time left in this world now do we. Please, get an actual real reason to not want better border security, a better economy for all, left and right sides, beside the lame and whimpy "I just can't stand Trump" and would rather see our country go down in flames than agree with him. How very childish.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.

Also, your GOP members of Congress are getting paid as well, you dumb motherfucker,Border patrol and customs, TSA, and Coast Guard  non essential Federal employees all not fully staffed.  How is that protecting our  borders again? Asking for a friend.
Remember the last terrorist attack here? Know how they arrived? Through customs via legal ports-of-entry. The last one before that was by two white dudes that were American citizens. Terrorists and drug dealers aren‚Äôt sneaking across the southern border through tunnels. They aren‚Äôt that stupid.,Sheldon Satchel thank you!!!
No they aren‚Äôt. He quite literally said that he would be proud to shut it down and would take credit for it. Try again,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage

Edgar D. GutierrezTexas is the only state to track crime specifically among illegal immigrants let's use them as an example:  Between January 2011- January 2019 there have been 10 school shootings in the state of Texas. Of those 10 shootings 15 people have died and 28 have been injured.   Now let's look at crime amongst illegal immigrants in Texas. "Between June 1, 2011 and January 31, 2019, 189,000 illegal aliens were charged with more than 295,000 criminal offenses. DPS criminal history records reflect those criminal charges have thus far resulted in over 120,000 convictions including 238 HOMICIDE convictions; 13,662 assault convictions; 3,158 burglary convictions; 17,930 drug convictions; 175 kidnapping convictions; 7,100 theft convictions; 11,336 obstructing police convictions; 1,013 robbery convictions; 1,710 sexual assault convictions; 1,153 sexual offense convictions; and 1,282 weapon convictions."

Asha Artis not American but wouldn‚Äôt most of your illegal immigration problems stem from a broken security system? I‚Äôm guessing most of them don‚Äôt walk over the border but are not caught by the checks in place. Even if they walk over the border why aren‚Äôt they rounded up and sent back? Is it possible that there is corruption here, why are they so easily avoiding detection? A wall won‚Äôt fix issues like these, get to the core of the issue, seems like a bandaid wall won‚Äôt fix this.,The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!

On November 13, 2001, President George W. Bush issued a new military order in the war against terrorism. The order called for the secretary of defense to detain non-citizens accused of international terrorism. The order specifically applies to members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. But it also includes all those who have engaged in, aided, or conspired to commit international terrorist acts against the United States or its citizens.Those who knowingly harbor such individuals are also subject to the order. Under the order, the secretary is charged with establishing military tribunals (also called military commissions) to conduct trials of non-citizens accused of terrorism either in the United States or in other parts of the world.

Nancy will lie on naming, all the way around.  2007 Schumer Dodd Hillary Pelosi democrats, all argued strongly for a wall - fence  - barrior. Wall naming belongs to those democrats. Donald just borrowed the word WALL from those democrats. Nancy will lie on who owns the shut down.

Like most libs I'm sure u are  for wealth distribution(taking money from folks who earned it and giving it to folks that have done nothing for this country. What a joke.  Maga,You Americans that support trump are so stupid. You are being duped. Open your eyes. Your republic is being undermined by this self serving clown
How much do you know about what you are talking about? The wall in Germany was built to keep people from leaving the country.Our wall is for the protection of Americans. There is no comparison. I will get the Dems will believe the that comparison because the government that tried to keep people under control is the very government Dems are building.,Bobb Marly the point was, did the wall solve any problems, and if so, why does it not exist today?
Elaine Herrmann he had to get the Economy and the Military rebuilt first,Tim Finch no the entire Party is responsible. They could have had it but they waited ( for what?) Now they have a great excuse Not to, Don‚Äôt have the votes anymore.  They are playing us.
Melissa Eads Parker let's face it former Speaker Paul Ryan and Mitc McConnell are where the blame should be placed,Tim Finch no the entire Party is responsible. They could have had it but they waited ( for what?) Now they have a great excuse Not to, Don‚Äôt have the votes anymore.  They are playing us.

George Winn I still say it shouldn't be an emergency.  He's president, not dictator dude. He doesn't get to dictate policy.  Congress passed a bipartisan bill and Congress decided his wall isn't needed. He needs to suck it up, put his big boy pants on, and stop thinking he is a dictator and realize he won't always get his way and acting like an asshole all the time guarantees more often than not he won't.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.

George Winn not dems fault Trump lies and makes up statistics that contradict government agencies to justify his wall.  What happened to Republicans being fiscally responsible?  Also not the Democrats fault Trump was planning this all along but decided to make over a million Americans suffer before declaring his emergency.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.

Charlesetta Brown better check with Obama‚Äôs Chief Border Guard.  Apparently he isn‚Äôt listening to you or any other liberal.  He supports Trump on his decision to build a wall.  Doubt the veracity‚Äî google it and find out for yourself.  Interesting that a former Obama official agrees with the Trump administration.  Especially since he is the individual one should listen to.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Nancy J. Seddon liberals lack common sense. Heck now they have several that support killing full term babies and have anti-semites in their ranks.,Anyone with any common sense or lives close to a border knows we need to build a wall and protect our country

Chase Blood she a snow flake,  were better of talking to the real snow flakes falling from the sky,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall.

Bill Klein, you must really hate America if you think any of what you just spouted off was a bad thing.and btw Russia wouldn't have wanted him to do any of that. What he has done is the best thing for America. TRUMP 2020 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.,Day 27 of the tRump government shutdown. Trump has a tendency to propose wild ideas out loud and then repeat them before coming to his senses or getting talked off the ledge. An off-the-top-of-our head list: Leaving NATO. Bombing Iran. Death penalty for drug dealers. Birthright citizenship. Firing staff. Firing Mueller. Leaving the World Trade Organization. Blowing up Iranian fast boats in the Persian Gulf. Withdrawing troops and families from South Korea. Nationalizing a 5G network. Withdrawing from Syria, (just to name a few) you saw what happened yesterday. According to the Washington Post President Trump has made 6,420 false or misleading claims. That‚Äôs the President of the U.S. Let me say that AGAIN ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the President of the UNITED STATES‚Äù We‚Äôre living in the shameless society, where accountability and apology are just white flags for the weak.
You are sheeptarded.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Don't try to understand since you are an uneducated moron.,Sue Howie stay in New Zealand and stay out of American politics funny how foriegners want a say in our President fu
Because of the actual ways they are getting in. Not everyone travels 80 miles through desert and very rough terrain heading to where you don't know.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another

Ronald Palmer  It certainly is a part of his job.  Since I do not perci me a threat along our Southern border, but I am alarmed by his contempt for NATO, I think he behavior and policy are inappropriate.,Timothy Norton well I`am from europe and President Trump is 100% correct about most european countrys not spending 2% on defence as for the southern border or any border in any country for that matter,you can`t have people wandering about coming and going as they please,from what I have read there is a huge volume of drugs comes into the USA through the southern border,if true thaat alone would be good enough reason for a wall even here in europe it has been a absolute disaster all the migrants getting in and allowed to wander unchecked ,just two days ago a afghan mirgrant stabbed a pregnant woman in hospital they managed to save the woman ,but the baby iis dead
Samuel Gonz√°lez  That is a false analogy for two reasons.  1.  You home and the countries borders are not the same thing.  You do not have anyone applying  for asylum, for example.  2.

Julie Smith  Re: three caravans, I was not aware, nor do I consider them a threat.  Why should I?  You must be aware that we have the largest and most effective military in the history of the world?  What threat to you suppose these or any of the billions of other migrants might pose?,Barbara. When I was in Puerto Rico I had to move my family to a gated community surrounded by a 12' wall and an armed guard at the gate. Gracias.
To be clear, because so many seem to want to imply this:  I do NOT think we should have open borders, nor do I think we should stop deporting illegals.  Though I certainly think we should prioritize deporting those illegals who are bad actors first...not hardworking illegals with families and a long history of positive behavior here.  Duh.  However, I do think we ought to spend our money on ACTUAL problems, like deporting those misbehaving here first and more and better train border security personnel.  One for immigration courts that currently seriously ask 5 year olds if they understand the nature of proceedings and sometimes perform proceedings over Skype.  We need to process asylum seekers and those accused of entering illegally with fast, fair and effective courts.  Obvious, we need to treat those being held pending trial humanely.  Keep children with parents (Jesus, do I really need to advocate that?), And stop the profiteering of private detention centers.  The proposed border wall fixes nothing and cost a fortune that could EASILY be better spent.  It is a bad idea that would not even fix the problems that are made up justify it.,Barbara. When I was in Puerto Rico I had to move my family to a gated community surrounded by a 12' wall and an armed guard at the gate. Gracias.
Tom Cook Awesome.,Don't let this distract you from the the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, "Spare Tire" Dixon.
Anne Crossway you obviously don‚Äôt know the full spectrum of the word security. I suggest joining the military and learning üòÇü§£ It‚Äôs called a deterrent. It‚Äôs not an end all solution, only part of the whole package (barrier, cameras, more personnel, equipment, etc...).  Democrats were all for a wall/barrier/fencing before, the ONLY reason they‚Äôre against it now is because of President Trump ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The President can literally come out with the cure to cancer and the Dems would be against it üòÇü§£ The President has and is still willing to compromise, like he did with DACA, and the Dems aren‚Äôt.....

Susan Rainville Fuller that's one of the big problems the Dems don't listen.  They are so upset that he won they won't listen.  It's a shame.  I don't understand how they can give 52 million for aid that includes money for abortions but they refuse to help American citizens.  Wish they would explain that.,Why must you always start with negativism about Democrats you are the president No one is  stopping you from fulfilling your promise they are trying to tell you you were mistaken with the promise and you need to do other things which are better and explain why
Im sorry about that everyone needs to be paid for doing their jobs.  The way I feel about it is we need that wall bad.  I live in a small town in Texas there are so many illegals here.  There are some good people to but alot just don't care.  I have seen them in the stores with ,3 or 4 shopping carts full of food and pay with a food card.  My mom and dad were really in need and only received 16 Dollars of food.  Its really not right for illegals to get food and our own true American citizens can't, when they paid taxes all those years.  We need that wall, fence, or whatever.  Mexico will end up paying for the wall, the trade deal we have with them.  My mom was 75 and my dad 85.,Tina James Moss Apple & Oranges. Hillary lost. Period.   This Predident in his own words lied about funding this damn wall.   Now, all my TSA friends, traffic cobtrollers won't get paid tomorrow.   So, please don't be so sanctimonious about two different subjects.   I didn't want him as president, but he won and that is the bottomline, now keep his word or suck it up.
Etta Ejg Moss double check that...wrong,Etta Ejg Moss double check that...wrong
Roy Meston no, the weak president was Obama,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Brian Cudmore well since your so smart come up with that great plan and present it,So......if Americans want border security why don't they bring all the US troops home who are out threatening border security of other countries in  the world, use the money they spend supporting insurgencies and corruption to guard the US border with Mexico?

Let‚Äôs just see you invite a dozen into your home.  You feed and clothe them. You pay there medical bills. Cause that is exactly where working Americans tax dollars are going.  We have enough hungry homeless people in our country that should come first js. Besides your democratics voted for a 50 billion wall before Trump became President don‚Äôt you even care what happened to that money don‚Äôt you wonder how Nancy and chuck became rich while serving our country and don‚Äôt you even wonder why they want so many illegals here they are allowing the law to be broken and doesn‚Äôt it bother you that they all have walls and fences around their homes for their safety. Truth is they use the illegals to get votes once they get illegal votes they don‚Äôt really care about them either. They only care about themselves and power. Wake up js,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

More Canadians are overstaying their visas than Mexicans. A wall does nothing to help that.,Please  do  an  emergency  order  and  lock  the  border  down  completely.  Mexico  needs  to  feel  the  pain  for  sitting  on  their  corrupt  asses  not  stopping  it  at  their  border.
Your a real pretty boy aren't you?,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Spoken like a true follower. Read closely what you wrote. I can see why you like puppet, no I'm not a puppet, puppet celebrity apprentice President.,No other country has open borders why should we

Where were you in 1968? Hanging with rich white Nixon folks in Chicago? Big Chicago been criminally infested with corrupt leaders as a standard for over a century.   Caravan? Send your church, not the military. Latin American asylum seekers are more Christian than Republicans pretend to be. BTW did you know that Canadians make up for most of the overstayed visas?   Your biggest error is overestimating his support. It is more than obvious that a majority of American disapprove of the President. The mid-terms are a fact he was a loser. His shutdown now has half of his supporters questioning if they would vote for him in 2020. He is falling apart, did you listen to his speech an hour ago about missile defense?,I sure am.  Thank you.

James Jerome   Apparently, you're getting your numbers from the same place Trump is, OUT YOUR ASS!,Let's have an official special issue vote for the border wall at local election sites.  Only those who can prove they were born in the U.S., or are legal citizens may vote.  No fake polls or rigged election.  No mail in ballots, or dead people voting.  Let's find out how many Americans support our President and really want this southern border barrier built.  If the public says to fund it, then the Congress MUST fund it.  My guess is that at least 3/4 of the whole population want the wall built.  Democrats are afraid of the truth!

Albert Kojo Kyekye thank you though you should not waste your time. There are too many bigots that are so simple minded that they cannot even recognize their own bigotry. In our country, we have become too soft, so there is a lot more disrespect for ones self and for others then the rest of the world believes. The worst part is their hubris prevents them from seeing it and/or admitting it. I wish both the liberals and conservatives would see that their beat interest is to genuinely work in our best intereat, and not for some stupid agenda or for money or corporate power. Its sad.

Typical reply from a blind liberal! Sit down!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Oh thats right the liberal paid media only Trump bash 24/7 for over two years BECAUSE THEY ARE PAID TO BY THE DNC/HILLARY CLINTON! Because she lost.....TWICE!! Maybe we would not be in this situation if they walked their talk....but Democrats just talk the talk! That was proven with 8 crap years of Obama!,So PAY THE F*CKING COAST GUARD.

Eric Helmes  Yes, put Trump in jail for knowingly hiring illegals first.   But it‚Äôs not even an issue. Historically illegal migration ebbs and flows according to economic need.

Kent Wojahn and let‚Äôs it forget- these things that still need addressing- NEEDED addressing during Obama‚Äôs tenure as well!,Thank you Mr Trump...Illegal Immigration costs us way more each year than building the wall.  Prior presidents have wanted to do this but never got it done.  Well sorry people, like him or not President Trump has been working for me, and you, and finally putting America first since he took office.  The economy is good, unemployed the lowest its even been, the military is getting stronger, and Trump is working to get all of the unfair deals and so on that the US has been getting screwed over on.  Yes there is alot of other things that need attention..prescription prices...veterans..elderly...homeless people, revamping the welfare system...but I think Trump has done a good job so far and glad he doesn't mind ruffling some feathers doing what he has to do to get things done..
Tony Palmer  I but it would prevent massive drug influx and criminals from entering,A wall would not have kept this from happening. :/
Donna Barnes, Are you really trying to compare a home privacy fence or wall with a 2,000 mile 30‚Äô wall that‚Äôs supposed to secure our borders ? Besides the fact that Obama does not have a wall around his home it would not stop serious criminals nor would Trumps wall. The wall around the Vatican was built in  the year 848, over 1,150 years ago. Probably was the latest technology at the time. Very silly and childish comparisons.,Donna Rinerr, Great then tell Trump his Great Wall is only 423 miles long because that is not what he is saying.
Trump says he is told a lot of things that aren‚Äôt true. Trump said his predecessors told him they supported his wall and all said they had no discussions with Trump about the wall and none support the building of a wall. So we can hardly believe Trump when he says border control agents want a wall or think it would work.,Donna Rinerr, Great then tell Trump his Great Wall is only 423 miles long because that is not what he is saying.

Joshua James Howard the wall would be funded completely in bout AJ hour lol,In my observations, President Trump, we aren't facing Democrats anymore. We are facing off against evil, itself.   There have been jokes circulating, that if you gave a public address stating that oxygen is good for us, they would all suffocate themselves to try and slander you.   I am starting to believe this, however, because all they do is try to stop you from protecting Americans and our country.   Here is what I suggest, if Congress will not fund the border wall, begin selling the bricks to us Americans. Design some kind of order form, and we will purchase the bricks.   I am willing to work OT, to buy as many of those bricks, as I can afford.   We the people stood behind you, to beat Hillary. You think we won't do it again, against a Democrat, cry-baby congress?

Chuck Owen - it's just the way I feel and I'm sorry it upsets you.  I don't think Trump wants to negotiate.  He wants a win to satisfy his base.  He will only accept what he demands.  Both houses voted unanimously before Christmas for a CR to keep the government open and continue debate on border security.  Trump did an about face.  Now McConnell won't even bring it up for a vote unless Trump gets his way.  He IS using American workers as pawns to sway public opinion.  It looks like extortion to me.  Of course the Democrats could  stop it by giving the extortionist what he wants; all or nothing.,Troy you are way out of touch !

Ottavio Esquivel... you are on the wrong page here go post to your own president in Costa Rica!,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
Go complain to Frau Merkel.. the distroyer of Europe!o,This is why I consider Trump someone who you can discuss with: he stopped Merkel! I didn't want to live in Germany and n e v e r would have voted for that bitch.

Kinda stupid everyone is chewing this girl out, if anyone remembers the basis for Trumps campaign was were gonna build a wall and Mexico will pay for it, now I'm all for the wall and i knew when he was running that Mexico wasn't going to pay, I personally want the wall but him shutting down the government and using Federal workers as ponds to get what he wants is kinda sad, we already have 2 prisons taken over by the National Guard because they have no staff due to this shutdown. He wont get his way unless he declares a state of emergency, which is what I want I wish he would go ahead and do it so families can have money flow back. Dont hate on me because I proved a point and you dislike my opinion, try having a father who works for the Federal govement and who doesnt know when his next check will come. This is damaging the Federal Govement not helping.,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
He will get well over 10 billion through remittances from the USMCA deal he made with Canada and Mexico so yes!,Wait wasn't mexico paying for the wall?
Places that have the strictest gun control measures have the most gun violence making it harder for law abiding citizens to have guns while criminals continue to get them however they please makes zero sense! It makes people less safer!,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
John Jacob google trump Epstein Clinton. They are pals,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels‚Äô hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy‚Äôs and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
Charles Boyd Didn‚Äôt they do that in Chicago, I heard it worked great lololol,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?

I notice alot of people who just seem to strangely believe that once a new president come in he snaps his fingers and suddenly everything good that happens his because of him. The first 3 to 3 and half years the current president is riding on the previous one did like how Obama's first years and company unemployment and so on was thanks to goerge Bush goerge Bush was riding Clinton's so he had a surplus in the begening and Bill's didnt start well because of Reagan's deficit.

Dave Callender coming from a man who lives in New Hampshire where people don't lock their doors come down to South Texas you'll change your mind,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Our President Donald Trump is the best President ever and the democrat communists are the worst of the worst,America first! Trump 2020!
The communist agitators are paid by the democrat communists kings that live in fortresses,I notice everyone who says a wall is useless, senseless or stupid has walls in their homes. Some even have giant walls or fences around their perimeters.
Our President Donald Trump is the best President ever,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Because walls work,Walls didn't work, why are they around every Hollywood stars and politicians homes?
The democrat communists lie everytime they open their mouths,Walls didn't work, why are they around every Hollywood stars and politicians homes?
The democrat communists lie everytime they open their mouths,Walls didn't work, why are they around every Hollywood stars and politicians homes?
The democrat communists are offering them all kinds of freebies and when they come they find out it was all a lie and they do what they known to do  best steal, attack , destroy,  murder , and democrat communists like it like that,Doing what's needed to have been done for DECADES....
Communist trolls are paid by their masters the democrat communists,do whats in your heart Sir.
Donald Trump the best President ever,do whats in your heart Sir.
James Kenney you are a comminst agitator alias a traitor,do whats in your heart Sir.
The democrat communists lure the illegals and when they are here they find out it was all a lie,  they do what they know what to do best steal, attack , destroy and murder,  its not like they were highly educated and with endless job skills , they dont even know English,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
The democrat communists offer them all kinds of freebies and when they come here they find out it was a lie ? How would you react? So its all the democrat communists plan to destroy America and become kings and make us slaves,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels‚Äô hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy‚Äôs and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
Democrat communists dont want to make America better they want to make America worse so they can hidr their crimes,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Donald Trump is the best President ever,Thank you Mr. President. #BestPresidentInYourLifeTime

Bill Champion ...not nice to call his base crazed...there are many people who feel the Dems are crazed...but we are all entitled to an opinion. Anyway, don‚Äôt underestimate or be short-sighted - Mexico could pay in time due to changes.  It looks like the Dems will continue to obstruct.  Amazing that the President has managed to improve the economy.  Many are thankful for the change from Obama‚Äôs NWO direction and the fact that Hillary is not POTUS.,For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.
Bill Champion -respectfully, note that you chose the word I used- ‚Äúshort-sighted‚Äù...and that is def not true of those who support our President (which was the point I was making when I used the word first).  People were hugely concerned with the direction that Obama was taking our country and certain that it would get much worse with Hillary. Mexico will pay for the wall with change to the burden we see from that country if Dems will stop obstructing progress.  I don‚Äôt recall anyone saying we would negotiate with their President for a fund. I cannot fathom how people are so naive, blind, or brainwashed to not see the changes we need for U.S. security and welfare.  We must enforce law and    do what we can to keep our border from being breached.  Do we help others?  Sure...what is the best solution?  All people of the world matter...not just those who try to enter illegally.  Countries need to work to improve their standard of living..the U.S. cannot house the world.  Additionally, we have the right to guard against harm. I am amused at Trump‚Äôs character attack.  Surely, you know that the ‚Äútrained politicians‚Äù who have served are no better.  Trump was in the entertainment industry before politics...so far there is no evidence of the disgusting behavior known by Clinton, JFK, etc. while serving as POTUS. Trump is not a trained, polished politician.   Many appreciate that he is not just that smooth talking image used by a political machine.  Many appreciate the fact that he has actual knowledge, skill, and success needed to bring good change...not just a do nothing career politician.  Is he perfect..no, but he was the best choice at the time.  He has proven to be capable of leading toward good change -especially if Dems would support this country and stop obstructing progress. Those who support the Dems socialist, NWO agenda are the short-sighted and misguided base.,For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.
Well Bill ..it appears the discourse is going nowhere.   I don‚Äôt think anyone expected for Fox to SAY that he will pay for the border wall...seems you do not get that change in interaction with the country will save the U.S. more than the price of a wall. The lifelong unflattering and or disgusting comment/behavior regarding Trump is a joke.  Do you really believe that someone with Bill Clinton‚Äôs sexual predator track record has not exhibited unflattering and disgusting comments and behavior??...and to be so disgusting WHILE SERVING as leader of our country!  The groomed politicians are somewhat smooth ...but nasty, and imo- Clinton is far worse...as other politicians are deceptive. Of course we vote and support who we feel would make the best leader (duh).. To excuse Bill Clinton‚Äôs behavior and say that it has no parallel to distress is such a blind comment of denial...along with thinking that Dems want border control that represent known and respected values is just being out of touch with the truth. Apparently you drink the koolaide...I don‚Äôt. If you cannot recognize the hypocrisy, lies, and socialist, NWO direction of the Dems...unfortunate. I think we can look at economic systems in countries and see that capitalism is far better than socialism. The Dems are not about the welfare of this country...they are about so much more..they are about their own welfare while serving the welfare and agenda of the machine behind them. Trump has faced bankruptcy..not uncommon for people who engage, don‚Äôt give up, and are successful.  The man gives his salary to charity, and I don‚Äôt want to hear garbage of how much he gives in respect to what he has.  Notably-Trump is not getting rich from politics as the career politicians are.  We need term limits so that those with political office just might possibly work for the welfare of the citizens and NOT toward a career focused on the welfare of themselves and their puppet masters.   The issues in Trump‚Äôs admin are fueled by the obstruction of said career politicians. The world issue is complex...too much to discuss. I applaud policy change with allies, and world policy in general.  A border wall with Mexico is just a small needed measure. (As far as the wall is concerned..it is needed for many good reasons, and far less money than the problem costs of our border being breached.  It will not solve the problem, but it only takes common sense to know that it will help.) Trump is shaking things up in a needed direction. The corruption is so huge and obstructionist are involved in that. Trump is not a perfect example of all that should be, but at least he has thrown a cog in the wheel of the socialist, NWO machine that the Dems deceptively serve.  Sadly, many are not aware of this threat that will ultimately result in change not good for people (to put it simply)...sadly, short-sighted and shallow thinkers. This is all I have to say...we see things differently.,For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.

Babi Nikki How can you be so cruel to say that the loss of her son has less concern or value or evil than another loss.  I feel sorry for you and will pray for people like you.  And I hope you never loose a child or loved one under these circumstances  And I also think that you must be a socialist communist democrat to make such a statement.  Shame Shame on you.,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver‚Äôs license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy‚Äôs car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL

Putin=Jewishh like Hillary. Ties via communism and Israel,Pres. Batshit supporters, you are Russian agents.
Keep organizing the country to take it back never give up. Organizing is what Americans do best collectively under pressure..,Doing a great job!! Stand strong for the American people!!

Commie run Hollywood pushes drugs and substance abuse in their movies. They set out to destroy nation states from within.,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it‚Äôs an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
hOLLYWOOD=jEWIISH RUN COMMIE AGENDA,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels‚Äô hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy‚Äôs and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
Expose Commie Trudeau too as he allows illegals and mass immigration to enter the country. He has Saudi oil ties-9/11 has to be reinvestigated a traitor to the founding peoples of Canada.,Mr. President, declare a national emergency and let‚Äôs get this done. We support you!

Israel and Saudi Arabia send illegals,So legally coming into this country is ok.. but the soft pussies want to let the whole world in...not fair to my grandparents
Israel is holding the USA back from prospering.,Americans first. Thank you Mr. President!
Americans are loved around the world!!! Stand strong and keep turning around the country. No excuses as Trump is a real estate developer. Most of fixing a country rests in its infrastructure. No better person to fix the issues and to secure the border.,thanks for saving the country
Trump=Capitalists and socialism Left=Communists. Communists never have a socialist plan and set out to destroy all democratic progress. 100 million people died under communist dictatorships. Marx=cousin to the bankers 1%,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
Trump is exposing commie Trudeau,Stand your ground sir. My family supports you 100%. Just try and relax your Twitter fingers a bit.
Russian has ties to Hillary via communism. Both Putin and Hillary are Jewishh,Russian Troll MORON !!!!
Communists whom are not socialists have no socialist agenda. Commies sit on the left to destroy all democratic progress then cry democracy can never work. Karl Marx was a commie cousin to the Rothchildds bankers. Whiet corporate men are not the 1% and never owned slavery nor the colony. Belfour Declaration never should have been signed.,Keep up the great work mr President, the socialists will not win
Communists have no respect for Christians around the world or for the Western World and frame the West for their evil agenda.,#WALKAWAY
Bring home the military protecting Israel's borders to protect the schools. Send them a bill for exploiting the USA for their own selfish interests. Allies????,How about safety in schools‚Äîoh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Trump is exposing communism in New Mexico and in California. Catholic Hispanics got divided against the protestants via communism. White corporate men never owned slavery nor put Mexico into poverty. Most Christians were catholic before,Americans want you out of office.... then truly America will be great again
Expose all hispanic communists and African brainwahsed Zionists and Israelites like Beyoncee and Whoopie. Africa existed before Israel and they cannot be either. NWO agenda to colonize African land using Africans.,Nancy is NOT working for the American people. She is working for the far leftist nut jobs trying to destroy our country. Stand firm Mr. President.
Trump is exposing communist Trudeau,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!
DEMS only care about Jewissh interests first globally.,their (the Left) struggle with you has gifted you with much positive publicity, use it for God's Good Donald J. Trump! <3
Dems are all for Israel they have a wall and military protecting its border. Expose the commie traitors.,Nancy Pelosi please give Americans the wall and it's necessary anyways. Just do it.
100 Million people died under communist dictatorships. The first thing the commies did was get people to give up their guns. Not going to happen in the USA with so many commies running in government. Media will not report it. Trump is right about the media same agenda in Canada.,What about gun control?
Communist Bernie Zionist shill,You are insane.
Americans need JFK not FDR. FDR a commie,There is nothing to fear but fear itself - FDR. Be afraid. Be very afraid - DJT
Trump is exposing communism in New Mexico and in California,If we don‚Äôt restore decency, compassion and competence to the Oval Office, then we cease to be a nation.
Non-negotiable. Dems don't want the wall so Israel can dump massive immigration into Mexico and the USA for their Zionist/commie NWO agenda. First job of any president is to secure safely is Trump for the USA or for Zionist Israeli interests????,Protect our borders and keep America safe!
Keep informing people hourly and daily. Expose communism across Mexico and California same banker agenda,Truth is your company Trump inc. Is owned by the Rothschild Zionist family...
Trump prevented Hillary from going into another country to destabilize it for Israeli commie interests. Hillary is no Christian American Patriot.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he‚Äôs the laughing joke all over the world...
Pelosi thinks Israel should have a wall and a military protecting its borders but not Americans???,Nancy Pelosi I want the wall!
Communist agenda via Zionist billionaire bankers. France protesting this agenda,They want open borders and high taxes.
Israel sends illegals to Cali via Hispanic commie leaders.,I support you Mr. President! I was informed California Democrats love illegal immigrants so they can give free benefits with voting rights to be Democrat so Democrats in office can continue holding power. Desperate and underhanded. I am a 3rd generation Californian and my mom just retired at 75 because she could not afford to sooner.
Exactly! Dems are all for Israel and Russia and they both have a military protecting their borders and Israel has a wall.,Tell Nancy and Chuck to come out from behind the walls around their homes
Dems are all for Israel first and they have a wall and a military protecting its borders. Send them a massive bill for exploiting the USA military for their interests in the Middle East. USA does not benefit.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Israel and Russia have walls and military protecting its borders. The USA must do the same thing and secure its borders.,A wall will NOT fix our immigration system.
Communist are the real problem. THey have no socialist agenda. Marx was a cousin to the Rothchillds bankers. He likes to frame the capitalists for the greed of the real 1% whom are not white corporate men.,Fight Socialism!!! Fix the law. SAVE US!!!

Brent Robinson Is From Boca Raton, Florida,This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Agreed, We pay tolls.,How to get Mexico to pay for the wall ? Charge a toll of one US dollar  pre person to drive or walk across the Border. A border wall is a matter of National Security Therefore allocate the money from the defense fund and get on with it. Charge a 19.65 peso toll at the border to drive into America... there you go! Mexico is well on its way to paying for the Wall!  According to Google, in 2017 2,016.42 people crossed into the united states using 16 pedestrian bridges. 350 million people drive into the United States with 330 ports of entry. I say Charge a Toll of $19.16 Pesos pre person... Wall Paid For!  Charge one US Dollar toll per person to drive or walk across into the U.S. at the border. Wall paid for!
Norene Boone the Dems wouldn't for for the wall of he wanted 10 dollars to build the whole thing.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

The BIBLE is PrezTrump's favorite book-- Luk 6:30  Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.  Luk 6:31  And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.  Luk 6:32  For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.  Luk 6:33  And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.  Luk 6:34  And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  Luk 6:35  But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.  Luk 6:36  Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  Luk 6:37  Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:  Luk 6:38  Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.,Take a good look at that. It's not just extreme christian humility. It's a world paradigm of caring and sharing.

Meanwhile, mainstream news outlets are not reporting that homelessness is ‚Äúexploding‚Äù out on the west coast.  For instance, we are being told that there are ‚Äú1000's of unauthorized tent camps‚Äù in the city of Seattle alone‚Ä¶  Housing prices are soaring here thanks to the tech industry, but the boom comes with a consequence: A surge in homelessness marked by 1000+ unauthorized tent camps in parks, under bridges, on freeway medians and along busy sidewalks. The liberal city is trying to figure out what to do.  But I thought that the Seattle economy was doing so well.  I guess not.  Down in San Diego, they are actually scrubbing the sidewalks with bleach because the growing homeless population is spreading hepatitis A everywhere‚Ä¶  San Diego now scrubs its sidewalks with bleach to counter a deadly hepatitis A outbreak. In Anaheim, 1000+ people sleep along a bike path in the shadow of Angel Stadium. Organizers in Portland lit incense at an outdoor food festival to cover up the stench of urine in a parking lot where vendors set up shop.  Over the past two years, ‚Äúat least 10 cities or municipal regions in California, Oregon and Washington‚Äù have declared a state of emergency because homelessness has gotten so far out of control.  Nice Job Nancy?  Lori Williams posted 1/19/2019-  We have a huge homeless population here in the Antelope Valley, California's high desert. Every under/overpass, vacant field, and any place they can pitch a tent...not to mention store fronts. They're begging in parking lots, gas stations, medians, and even coming into the business where I work. Our homeless shelter closed for lack of funds, and I won't go out after dark anymore. If they do manage to move them, hazmat has to come and clean up after them. But hey, let's allow even more people in that we can't care for, sad.  -------------------- That is all.....,I still don‚Äôt want a wall- didn‚Äôt 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.

Whose going to pay for the wall?  https://www.facebook.com/1087167058116488/posts/1188671814632678?sfns=cl  Trump lied....over and over and over again.  When he said,‚ÄùI could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,‚Äù he wasn‚Äôt calling you loyal; he was calling you STUPID.,Hopefully sane Americans see that Democrats are playing politics with our security.  Will the wall stop 100% of illegals? No it won't but it will stop a lot and it costs so little that it should be a no brainer.
other country's have tougher laws and enforce them ...in other country's if you steal you get your hand cut off, here you get a slap on the hand... other country's if you kill someone you get put In front of a firing squad,  here you get 20 years of appeals till your unfit for death...see the difference we need stricter laws and to enforce them..,No other country has open borders why should we
yea hopefully god blesses you so you don't get sent to hell....,God Bless you President Trump! üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46784315,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
illegal crossing is down to lowest levels in years,Mickey Murcudgeon yes it seems really ridiculous to lock your doors on your house at night? just because we want a wall doesn't mean we're not putting a door in it dumbass.You want to come into the country you do it legally or don't come at all
Heads down!! Incoming liberal bullshit!!!!,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
Rita Abrahamson where are you getting your information?,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Alberto Weisz so why are there still doors at your place then? You still carry a set a keys to get in too???,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Bill Johnson never Mr Tromp he don't care for any one .. only for him .. An I a republican an a vet  ..  toll me Tromp return the money of department of education for veterans,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Vicki Squires not walk ... Everything is a false .  I Republican an A vet.. an leaved at border line over 25ry.. that is not the way all yours peaplo said..  Now you an all saying .. Hispanic or Latinos they are the only one do crimes.. lest me say in this are the people coming more crimes is white..  the products drugs in the home house.. an cultivate marijuana.. is white..,We can‚Äôt continue to let these criminals come into OUR country. Save lives. Build the wall. With the billions we save supporting these welfare bums we can invest in our veterans, aging adults and children.
√ñzg√ºn Ser√ße Erg√ºr yes.. ask the Chinese Korean Vietnamese an others that ares ..   What happens whit ISIS crossed from Canada borderline,If you build a wall, illegal immigrants will come with a boat. And boat owners will make huge money by human trafficking, some poor illegal immigrant children will die by drowning, because boat owners will receive more people than the capacity. Another drama will start. Do you really want this? In other countries this is happening. wall is not the solution..
Gary Kane ok, so how many are you willing to house?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Borders? Never heard about protected border in EU... Sadly. Maybe some legend from XX years ago.,No other country has open borders why should we
I did? When he said he wanted to run for president!,I did? When he said he wanted to run for president!
Brandon Burgoss you‚Äôre kidding right?,President Trump they are breaking the law not protecting our country like they said they would when they took the oath
Michael Pearson And you,sir, are a troll.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Wall isn‚Äôt going to happen,Mr. President, stand your ground in order to protect our country. Americans are with you.  God bless the USA
He will continue to do nothing for you as well,Thank you Mr President!  Stay strong.  My family is praying for you.
Carl M√∂rner Trumpcucks get hard off of dead kids.,Well as I understand it the wall is primarily built to stem the rotating flow of 400.000 deportations and illegal entries every year. The berlin wall and the soviet/russian border towards finland required guardtowers,minefields,troops,dogs etc to be efficient.
Oh and dumbass, trump didn‚Äôt even win the majority vote.    The wall is even less popular than he is.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
They already are.    They are stopping a dipshit man child from pissing money into a worthless wall to make bigots feel less scared.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
Danny Jones your culture must be trash.    Why are you garbage humans?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
No comrade Dave, here in this country we don‚Äôt allow the tyrant president to do end runs around congress.    We call that a coup, and we execute people for it.,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Can‚Äôt believe people love this orange lying mentally clown more than they love this country.,Can't believe people hate this President more than they love this Country. Protect your borders now.
But Fox News toldz him dey waz?!,Well, then it is obviously the goal of the democrats to weaken the US from within so that it's easier for them to let in illegal immigrants to vote for them and maintain their power :3
John N Karen Morris yes that is something a fascist cunt would do.  We know how to deal with fascism here.    To report a president that is a Russian asset, support Mueller.,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.
The only thing he should hang for is treason.,Suiter Kaye That‚Äôs on Flint, Michigan. That falls under state government. What is your corrupt Democrat run state government doing with your money instead of fixing your drinking water problems? That doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the rest of us. I wouldn‚Äôt bring that up if I were you. It doesn‚Äôt prove your point.
Keith Webber Jr. of course since Obama never declared one to deny confess, you just proved you are a fucking idiot.    Why do you hate America?,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
No shock the religious ones are the type of hypocrites that support trump.    He needs a deeply uneducated easy to lie to base.    If you are an adult with imaginary friends, you fit the bill.,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
Border security is not the same thing as a wall.,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
Lisa Mann it would, but Trumpcucks are very very stupid.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
What‚Äôs the weather like is Moscow this time of year ‚ÄúMaxine‚Äù?,These paid haters are really stupid, Soros needs to cough up a little more money and get some with some brains!
Spoken like a true fascist.    Why do you hate America?,Worley Michael Bwhahahahahahahahaha
Comrade Veronica seems confused.    Trump is Russia‚Äôs bitch, they are paying to help him.    Putin doesn‚Äôt want his cock holster out of the Oval Office.,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
Then why is russia backing Trump?,The Dems don‚Äôt want us to be a Strong Nation,, they want Communist rule!!
And Tom has both a limited education and a mental disorder.,Worley Michael you still got nothin.
Aww I think we triggered the little trumpcuck.    Are you afraid that Putin‚Äôs cockholster is going down?  I love how Barr duped your dipshit orange clown into thinking he was against Mueller.    You know Mueller is a republican right?  He is just one of the few that still has some balls.,Worley Michael you still got nothin.
You actually think the president can put TVs inside congress?     You really don‚Äôt understand how a republic works do you?,Worley Michael You teach us....................the comment expressed a desire to see the anti-security Demos be VISIBLY seen along side (or, underneath) their own public remarks, ON RECORD of their "commitment" to this nation's security.  Probably not on your list of expertise either, but this President just hosted the national champ football team..................founding fathers probably omitted that function....................whadya think?
Wendi DelValle liar.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Albert Kojo Kyekye, come here Trump will happily deport you..and if you're not deported you'll pay double In health care..and live paycheck to paycheck...,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Anne Garcia right but we are not talking about Democrats, Biden, Gore, Obama or Hillary!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Cindy Ann Godfrey you are definitely brainless,Mitchell James lol didn‚Äôt bother looking did you

PAUL HOW ABOUT OUR POLITICIANS WORK TOGETHER AND DO THE BEST FOR THIS COUNTRY AND ITS CITIZENS.....,1 year ago. #msdstrong  How many children die from gun violence? Declare THAT emergency.
Donna Snyder, we have a Coast Guard station where I live along the California Coast along with several military installations. We have a credit union who is offering loans interest-free for those affected, the county animal shelter (no-kill) that's offering free food for pets, and so many other organizations helping those in need.  Ventura County went through two wildfires in two years and is now dealing with heavy rain and flooding. We got through it before and we'll do it again. People will always help.,Stand firm sir. I do wish something could be done for the coast guard service personnel! They have no union benefits
MaryAnn Scandurra, my son is a federal employee and a member of the "border security" Donnie is holding hostage. You know the "border security" he's SO sure our country needs. Ironic, isn't it?,Stand firm sir. I do wish something could be done for the coast guard service personnel! They have no union benefits
Joanne MacEachern, people CLAIM Donnie "doesn't get paid." Where's the proof when he's NEVER shown his tax returns? What's he hiding?,Each member of Congress should NOT be paid their salary and also fined $2000.00 a day the government is in Shutdown
Robbie Miller, no, sweetie, what David Schroeder wrote about the CNN report and Rudy is NOT "Old news." It happened YESTERDAY.   Why are you people so resistant to the truth?,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.

The name RUSSIA seems to pop up often. WHY?   If President Obama was such a hardened criminal why has the ONLY issue connected to him was paying a fine for errors in campaign records? Not ONE indictment, not ONE conviction and NO ONE from his administration went to prison. Oops!,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Nadine Weber, do YOU live at the border that you can honestly say "how bad it is"? Seriously! You live in NEBRASKA!!   You people are caught up in hysteria for something that doesn't even AFFECT you. This "border crisis" was created by the man in the White House to deflect from the fact he has RUSSIAN CONNECTIONS!,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!

Worley Michael Lol shut up your kind don't know what fascism is...hint: It's not when your side loses an election and decides to engage in a corrupt witch hunt against a duly elected PoTUS.

Brian Bray you are absolutely right. Let‚Äôs abolish the police because of a few bad apples.,She looks more like a fish.
Margo Smith wow, really? You have fake profile.  Why hiding.  If you say something stand by your words.,White American men kill the most Americans every year. True fact. What keeps me safe from them?

No, it's about playing for the team not the people.  Chuck and Nancy and many more Dem reps voted for 350+mi boarder wall under Obama but can't do that now because their voter base hates Trump, with a Dem as prez they would build the wall a little at a time like they have been, but stabbing DACA in the back was 100% "playing for the team".,Both sides are afraid you'll fix things, it gives them less to fight about and less to feel 'needed'. Keep it up!
And I'm sure you say the same about Obama? Not to mention chuck and Nancy voted for more wall under Obama then they are being asked for now and you think the wall is what they are holding firm on? They are just saving face and playing for their team which apparently daca is not part of. Way to stab yourselves in the back idiots.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Lol that's why her and chuck voted for over 350mi of boarder wall under Obama and yet won't even take a deal for daca for less then 250mi under Trump right? LMAO you Dems are so stupid you don't even know your own reps voting history and cheer them on as they stab you in the back! üòÇ  So smart though! Stunning and brave!!!,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Both chuck and Nancy voted for over 350mi of wall under Obama, the only reason why they didn't take a deal for daca is because they are trying to save face and be "team players".  If Obama was still pres and asking for less then 260mi of wall... Well we already saw how they cast their vote.  All these leftists who think chuck and Nancy are playing for then are dense idiots.,If, this touched Nancy‚Äôs family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy‚Äôs heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!

They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp!
