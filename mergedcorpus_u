They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

https://www.facebook.com/WakingTimes/photos/a.310270242386064/593405320739220/?type=3&theater,Republican Congressmen and Republican Senators, all Republicans, need to forget Nancy and hound all the other democratic Congressmen and Senators.  Work on them and they'll do something about Nancy Pelosi.  Pelosi needs to be reminded of who it is she works for and that she is NOT the president....not even close.

,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Mark Butler aw are you trying to spam me with all the :) and >:( come on.,Bulld the wall using this Mr Trump Public Law No. 85-804, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1431-35 (Supp. IV 1998), grants to the President the authority to authorize any agency which exercises functions in connection with the national defense to enter into contracts or into amendments or modifications of contracts, and to make advance payments, without regard to other applicable legal provisions whenever such action would facilitate the national defense. 50 U.S.C. § 1431. The legislative history of the statute indicates that it may also be used as the basis for making indemnity payments under certain government contracts.
Mark Butler have fun looking at my page and just don't forget 6 MORE YEARS Trump 2020!,Bulld the wall using this Mr Trump Public Law No. 85-804, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1431-35 (Supp. IV 1998), grants to the President the authority to authorize any agency which exercises functions in connection with the national defense to enter into contracts or into amendments or modifications of contracts, and to make advance payments, without regard to other applicable legal provisions whenever such action would facilitate the national defense. 50 U.S.C. § 1431.

Stop begging the criminals and arrest them please,Use emergency powers roll tanks arrest all the deepstate
Norene Boone and just how many executive orders leap frogged passed Congress by Mr I've got a pen and a phone?,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Will Ihrke other presidents have called for a wall he's the only one with enough guts to do it.,I wouldn't call it a crisis, but a major concern that should have been dealt with decades ago. But it's funny how the Democrats flipped suddenly on their debate tactics for this issue. Any other issue and they dig deep and pull out all the unique tragedies and cry about how terrible it is for this one person, so we should change society just for them. However, Trump decides to play the emotion card and he's called a liar and every other name in the book. He's playing the game they invented. What poor sports.
Tonya Justice Sweetie how do you figure? I am almost 62 years old , I got a job 3 days after I turned 18! Never received anything from welfare you ignorant ass!

I am not against border security, but didn’t you republicans have 2 years to get this wall done? What happened? How is a wall going to stop terrorists like the ones on 9/11? You do realize that they have caught more people that are on “suspected terrorists list” coming in from the Canadian border don’t you? Are we going to build a wall between us & Canada also? Where is the caravan that was supposed to show up in November? They magically vanished!,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it!

Harriet Jones another demorat... Crawl back under your bridge, you troll,YOU DO NOT HAVE THE FIGURES.MORE LIES!!
Wow, you would rather have a crumbling cement wall than provide healthcare to women and children. You are a true member of Cult 45.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Matty Wagner yes ! “We the people” doesn’t really apply ! The majority bipartisan and the majority of the population Rutgers laugh at such a stupid statement or they just ignore juvenile behavior ! It’s we the dwindling base that wants this or that ... the most outrageously funny is the bullshit with call an emergency or executive order? I know Americans are a bit behind the curve but don’t they know how things work ? Looking at the demographics for trump supporters explains a lot though - hey stay in touch this freak show dumpster fire country has great entertainment in store for the next few months until he and his nepotistic children are behind bars !!,Pace yourself donnie !!

It will slow them down for sure. I can't figure why the Dems were all for wall when OBAMA was in but not now.

Stephen Pierson Thats a lie FAKE POLLS,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
Worley Michael If you take all the dead people off and illegals he did better start doing home work.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
Some Rep gave theirs up but not one Dem .Their greedy and now we have MAXIPAD & BUGJUICE CORTEZ going to manage our money. They can't add 2x2 together.Maxipad paid her daughter 750,000 stuffing envelopes.We know if missing money where to look.,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Danny Jones  The £39 billion is the divorce bill that we HAVE to pay to the EU.muppet!,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Anne Coughlan ...point,I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can’t fool everyone. Open the government !

Madam I want discussed,Russians understand better than anyone what socialism and communism.Behind the attractive slogans is the tragedy of the country and every family.And our President puts his life and health to protect our beloved America from this disaster.I would have forced all Democrats to study the history of the creation and fall of the Soviet Union.If Russia had been told in 1916 that a revolution would have taken millions of lives of three generations in 1917,no one would have believed it.I pray for our President and his victory in this struggle.

Virginia Davis Allen Thank God for our President.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,Typical! She doesn't care about anyone but herself
I do support the border wall.🙂,Don't be surprised if he does an assault weapons ban cause he already ban bump stocks. He use to support the assault weapon ban years before he ran for president. He has already went against the promises he has made.
The law was rewritten on the definition of machine guns. Which could lead to something else being ban.,Don't be surprised if he does an assault weapons ban cause he already ban bump stocks. He use to support the assault weapon ban years before he ran for president. He has already went against the promises he has made.
the real definition of an assault rifle is a full auto with a select fire but the liberals say anything that holds more than 10 rounds. My point is that he banned something and is not going to refund anyone for them which is thief.,Don't be surprised if he does an assault weapons ban cause he already ban bump stocks. He use to support the assault weapon ban years before he ran for president. He has already went against the promises he has made.
Barb van der Burg SHE IS NOT part of the negotiations. DO YOU EVER THINK? NO?,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Yet NANCY put out a screw you letter to DACA and the workers BEFORE he even uttered a word.  Sadly this is 100% about TRUMP.. screw the country.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
This is all about TRUMP.. so stagnation is coming cause this is a taste of the lefts obstruction.,Agree need wall, but don't keep punishing the working class to get it.  If shutdown keeps going, the next thing we'll face is a major Recession.   No money to pay bills, let alone buy anything or even go out to eat.  Use your executive order and end the shutdown
Yet NANCY put out a screw you letter to DACA and the workers BEFORE he even uttered a word.  Sadly this is 100% about TRUMP.. screw the country.,I'm a huge Trump supporter but he made it appear that he had closed the deal on the wall.  Instead he comes out with this whimpy proposal lol

Carol Starr my government turned their backs a long time ago I think.,Wish we had a government in the UK like yours.
Joseph Roy ...Kris Landers missing the whole point. Plain and simple..this person should not be in this country. What part of illegal does she not understand? End of the day this young ladies life is gone as a result of an illegal immigrants action. Nothing petty about that.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

STFU - we're only supposed to care about the few that are killed by illegal immigrants and ignore the rest...,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
From a weak president.,I'm a huge Trump supporter but he made it appear that he had closed the deal on the wall.  Instead he comes out with this whimpy proposal lol
🤢🤮🍆💦,And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.             Thank you Jesus for Trump and Pence.
Typical LibTard Projection.,Jim Towery you are truly misinformed.   The government contracts out for many specialized services.  Those folks will not get any “back pay”.    Ignorance is the #1 quality of trump supporters.
Either is Putin lol,Eric Wroblewski thank you
As soon as trump could see he couldn't  give Putin what he was asking for, like being allowed in the g8 again. And he  saw he was not allowed to obstruct justice and undermine the institutions. He then began to get revenge on those leaders institutions and allies and citizens who have opposed his agenda.  Putins plan right out of the white house, to create a new cold war against Mexico and Canada and the allies. By using immigration and trade wars and nationalism. To divide the nations and the people from each other and from their leaders. While he is creating a new three amigos alliance, of Putin Trump Kim along with other autocratic regimes. Where trump continues to meet with, and ignore, and enable their rigged agendas.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Trumps fake campaign promise and his rigged agenda to walk away form a comprehensive deal on immigration. By waiting 2 years to create a shutdown to blame democrats and to continue to distract from the Russian rigged agenda, and the campaigns conspiracy to collude to confuse,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
I also believe President Trump will dedicate his second term to draining the swamp as promised, which in my opinion is brilliant,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Diana Klausner ...I agree with you but honestly believe they are helping our cause in 2020...making it much easier for Trump to be re elected because a lot of people are seeing that party for what they truelly are.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Jeff Covington ...so far nothing seems to convince me of that...not because im closed minded either.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.

The problem is when the immigrant doesn't face any charges because they are here illegally.   My uncle was killed in aurora colorado. He was hit by an illegal alien who was driving drunk without a license. The courts commuted his ENTIRE sentence so that he could be deported. So he is probably in mexico drinking beers with his friends while my aunt and cousins have no father or husband.,Drunk drivers come from all walks of life. I'm sorry for the family. But it seems like alcoholism is the root cause of the epidemic that caused this death and thousands of others.

they already gave him 1.7 billion last year. The republican controlled senate rejected it last year. He has yet to justify 5.7 billion. And why should congress pay for it?

BONUS FACT: He would have got 12.5 billion for his wall in early 2017 if he would have gave the DACA's citizenship.

This sums up the shutdown from the framework of our government. It lays out the facts. I am sharing this from another person who posted and please do share as well. I am not normally political. This post will be an exception because I am an American and I am concerned. Please allow me to frame the issues involved with "the wall" in its actual terms. Despite what the media is saying, this is not about Democrat vs. Republican. In short, the executive branch of our government is threatening to declare a national emergency since the legislative branch will not authorize the seizure of private American property for a federal works project nor will fund it. The executive branch has already shut down the federal government. It is currently threatening to extend this government shut down for however long it takes for the legislative branch to cave. Let us break this down. First of all, the framework of our government is based on checks and balances. Power is divided into three branches: the Executive, the Legislative, and the Judicial. The Legislative branch controls the purse strings of government and creates laws. The Executive branch carries out those laws. The Judicial branch tells us whether the laws are constitutional or not. Each branch was designed to be able to balance the other branches. Why? As shown by our original rebellion, Americans didn't want a King or a Dictator when we were setting up our government. We were not particularly thrilled with a House of Lords telling us what we could or could not do either. In this case, the executive branch wants to: (1) take governmental cash,  (2) create its own law,  (3) take away private property from American citizens  (4) create its own federal works project. At least three of these functions fall within the power/ responsibility of the legislative branch. So, what is the problem? This is one of the most naked power grabs by the executive branch over the others in recent history. Once that power is exercised, it is going to be difficult or impossible to regain any balance again. The executive branch was never meant to have that much power (see our country's previous concerns about Kings and Dictators). Is this constitutional? Very doubtful. Should all Americans be concerned? That is a question for you to answer yourself. Second, a "National Emergency" is generally declared under these general conditions:  (1) Natural disasters including hurricanes, tornados, and earthquakes to name a few.  (2) Public health emergencies such as significant outbreaks of infectious diseases.  (3) Military attacks.  (4) Civil insurrection. (5) Any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy. Now the first 4 aren't applicable. The last category was meant to be short-term only. It was designed to be reviewed by the legislative branch every year after it’s enacted (because again; the check and balance is fundamental to how we operate). So, what is the problem here? If national emergencies can be declared by the executive branch for non-emergency purposes which vest power in one branch of the government why would that branch ever let go of that power again? Third, the seizure of private property (known as “eminent domain”, a body of law which says the government cannot just take your home without due process). You are joking, right? No. The US/Mexican border is 1,933 miles long. It runs through 4 states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas). Only 33% of that land is actually owned or managed by the Federal Government. A sizable percentage of that land is owned by the Indian nations. It is land preserved for those tribes by treaty and land given under treaty is not land owned by the United States. These tribes already have a lot of reasons to be angry at the Federal Government. This would be pouring additional gas on an open flame. The other 64% of that land is privately owned. How much land would have to be taken? The amount of land that the Federal Government would have to take would likely run 1,237 miles long to 12,371 miles deep (assuming a 1 to 10-mile DMZ from the border into the United States). Even if we could only take 100 to 500 ft of land in densely populated areas, that is a lot of private property that is going to be seized by the Federal government. The land necessary for this project would also run through some highly populated areas in the US such as San Diego, Calexico, Nogales, El Paso, and Laredo. There will be a lot of Americans who are going to have their homes and businesses taken by the federal government. Which will also mean a lot of lawsuits. In terms of the federal works project, these types of works include hospitals, bridges, highways, walls and dams. These projects may be funded by local, state, or federal appropriations. If they are federal, they are funded by the legislative branch of our government (the same branch that our executive branch is currently trying to take power from). Is the seizure of power constitutional? Not likely given the separation of powers discussed above. Finally, these considerations do not take into account the sheer cost, human and monetary, that will be involved. The Department of Homeland Security estimates the current cost at $21 billion for construction alone (not counting costs of maintenance or costs associated with increased military/federal patrolling). Ask yourself a simple question. When was the last time that you saw a governmental project brought in under time and under budget? Does anyone remember the “big dig” in Boston, Mass? The actual costs are likely to be much higher. This estimated cost also does not include compensating folks for taking their land or the associated impact upon their businesses. The Federal budget deficit grew to $779 billion dollars in 2018 according to the Treasury Department. How are we, as a country, going to fund this project? How are we, as a country, going to deal with the additional debt? Unlike private businesses, our country cannot declare bankruptcy. This is not about Democrat vs. Republican. It is not about who has the best zingers measured in 10 second sound bites. It is about our country. The core of this issue deals with the profound and immense changes the outcome will have on the structure of our national. This is the way that we, as a country, should be framing these issues. Please think about it." Please share!,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.

Probably true,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Yep. That or she is compromised somehow. A lot of us in CA think the MX cartels have taken control of our dem politicians.,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP

Do some research on your own and see how much has been donated to those countries over the last 20 years...that hasnt changed anything..only thing that would do anything is to go in by force and remove their goverment in a all out war...until people in those countries stand up to their own goverment nothing will change.. 80% of the worlds population according to the UN lives on less than 10 dollars a day...is it sad yes but we cant support the whole world,? People are fleeing their countries because they are afraid they are going to get raped or killed., right? Or to get a better job or education?  —why don’t the higher ups or leaders in those countries do their jobs! and make it a safe and prosperous place for their people to live!! Instead of building a wall...Use the money to make those countries civilized instead of acting like barbaric assholes!  I don’t get it. Enlighten me please.

TSA workers who aren’t getting paid are starting not to show up, putting our aviation industry in danger. The workers need to feed their families. Trump said “I can relate to federal workers not getting paid”. Lol! This from a guy who inherited millions of dollars from his dad. Tell that to the CBP officer who can’t pay rent. Trump has never had to pay rent or make a car payment. Those USSS agents that guard Trump and put their lives on the line everyday are working for free as is the Coast Guard and more! Trump could care less! This is a crisis caused by the liar in the WH and a GOP that is spineless.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Trump hates all average Americans, has zero empathy for the working class American.  Trump thinks Fed workers are Dems so he can screw them. Trump is supposed to be the Pres of the US, not Fox News! Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall, not the US taxpayer. TSA workers who aren’t getting paid are starting not to show up, putting our aviation industry in danger. FDA workers aren’t showing up to inspect our food. The workers need to feed their families. Trump said “I can relate to federal workers not getting paid”. Lol! This from a guy who inherited millions of dollars from his dad. Trump has never had to pay rent or make a car payment, he’s clueless and amoral. Trump is an amoral pig.,38 er cent approval rating.
Brent: All Trump supporters should work for free during the shutdown, just like the 800k federal workers Trump didn’t mention. Put your money where your mouth is!,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
All Trump supporters should work for free during the shutdown, just like the 800k federal workers Trump didn’t mention. Put your money where your mouth is!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Paul: All Trump supporters should work for free during the shutdown, just like the 800k federal workers Trump didn’t mention.

He’s trying! The democrats only want to give foreign aid and don’t want to give anything for American protection.,He should not be doing it at the expense of those of us who work in some of the most stressful and dangerous positions that no one else would
Roberta Anastasia Keep it shut down! We are a military family and fully support the government shutdown. Being a military family and living on post, I have gotten to hear how many other military families feel about the shutdown and 99% of then AGREE!,Amy Miller you are making this up. I am from a military family and we are heartsick over how this draft dodger has ruined this country and now causing hardship to ours.
Ruined our country how? The  Unemployment rate is at a all time low, he has opened up more jobs, even food stamps and government assistance is at a low. He has been doing his best, to do everything he said he would.,Amy Miller you are making this up.

Karen Solis Nimmo Hugh difference a wall and saving people’s lives!! Besides President Obama didn’t Promise that Mexico would pay for our Insurance😳😳,What’s more important a Wall or People being able to provide for their families!! Time for Congress to change the laws on Shutting down the Government!! The Government should never ever be able to shut down without the votes coming from the house and the senate approval!! This needs to soon be enforced because every-time U cannot have your way this is exactly what U will do!! RESIGN

Chris Easley get real, someone should have stopped those boats your ancestors were sailing on to get to America,Stop the underground roads/tunnels that are secretly invading out country. Caterpillar equipment is building the underground. Stop it!!!

Lynn Limauro Floyd sorry for your loss, but there are white kids shooting up your schools and killing a lot of innocent children the whites have been killing and raping since you set foot on American soil. No one did anything to you.  Building a wall will not protect you from danger.  Zimmerman killed a young boy and got away with murder.  Who feels sorry for his parents. They received no justice. The Native Americans were massacred and given smallpox and had their land taken away.  What about them.  As soon as you white people loose someone to any race but your own you want to act uo, save it.  You are no better than anybody else.,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Mary Larkin and Ted Bundy killed a lot of white girls too.  What is your point.,Young woman from NY was just murdered by an 🚫 illegal her body put in a suitcase and dumped on the side of a road in Connecticut. BUILD THE WALL

Maureen Hersey Brown get your asses out of other countries and then talk.  The sad part about it is.  A white man would kill you quicker if you took your front door off.  I guess you whites think your god fearing righteous citizens.  Don't make me laugh.  Look at who have been the serial killers, all white.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Maureen Hersey Brown you wouldn't because you have never been opressed, your people just stole and killed to get what the want.  The are not illegals, they are human beings, and God created them just as be created you.  You are not from this land dear so when you go back to Europe and make a comment it would be worth listening to until then, stfu.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Apple Rivera So sorry you went through that. Enterprise should take responsibility. Hope they find him but probably not unfortunately.,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, “Daniel Zuniga” who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didn’t take responsibility because they said they didn’t contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found. Find all underground tunnels coming into the US.  #BUILDtheWALL President Trump 🇺🇸

Kim Nielsen STFU and learn English you window licking idiot!!,IDIOT all this BULLSHIT from you i lie and lie and lie, you are really ill i youre head, and im so sad that there are so many sick Americans who are voting for you, they have apparently forgotten that the United States arose because of immigrants, even your own wife is not real American, so you are so far out. Is your wife also a criminal and a drug addict, just like anybody you mention now, maybe she is since she is married to someone like you
Ron Lammardo put the pipe down you stupid hippie!!,Apparently you made a stronger pledge to Putin to destroy our country.  #AgentOrange #RussianAsset
Eh, let's leave her alone.  It's painfully obvious that Denise here is just a washed up, out of touch crusty old bag.  She probably doesn't get much attention in real life so she trolls the internet to get her daily dose of human interaction.  Yes, it is pathetic, but also a very real and growing trend amongst the lonely and socially depraived.,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
You are a fool.  You think lies are truth and that truths are lies.  I am very thankful that the majority of people in our great country are not as foolish as you are.,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Russell Lehr The gun control is the reason people do die. Without legal gun owners, people with illegally owned guns can just come into your house and murder your whole family and you cant do a thing about it? You want that? Besides, legally owned firearms is a constitutional right. 2nd amendment, right to bare arms. You give away your arms, you give away your freedom.,Trump said that Mexico is going to pay for the wall Randy I'll wait!
Russell Lehr how many innocent  people have to die before you ignorant Democrats even start to care?,Trump said that Mexico is going to pay for the wall Randy I'll wait!

Jason Martinez your ass should be put on a bus back south,Lil Donny, your at a point where you are losing biggly! Good luck with that wall idea of yours. 🤗🤩🍾🥂 Also I agree, his address should first be put on paper.
Joseph Hart military is still funded you idiot,Lost my vote in 2020 the minute DHS didnt get paid.  #paythecoastguard
Marley Dee pelosi has no say in his giving state of the union , washed up old bitch,Trump hates Powerful women.  In fact he despises them.  - Pelosi Has denied him his State of the Union Address  - Pelosi arguably has more power than he does right now  -  Pelosi will ultimately lead the Impeachment of this alleged Russian Asset  This Powerful woman Wins!

1. Literally no one is advocating an open border policy. 2. I assume you've never been to the EU.,No other country has open borders why should we
you are correct sir,Eric Wroblewski thank you
https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/346213832769560/,Put a wall around Illinois, mass shooting, Chicago murder rate.  Put a wall around LA lots of gangs and murder there. Put a wall aroung FLA, NY, Michigan the crime in their large cities deserves to stay behind walls. Come on Trump you are all powerful now declaring national emergencies, over riding your constitution for your own gain. You are soon to be the USA’s first Emperor.
I can tell you the most important thing he did for me he lowered my corporate tax rate from 37% down to 21 he got rid of that useless Obama Care mandate he made it possible for employees to buy health insurance through other companies in across state lines and that's just a couple that I can think of that changed my life my business has never been so busy since I have been in business everybody I know is hiring looking for people every corner you turn there's a help wanted sign unemployment is at its lowest rate in decades Beverly you should head down to your local government and apply for support pet you can get a chicken and put it on a leash and you can take it everywhere you go to the doctor to the supermarket to the gas station and when you're feeling down and out you can grab that chicken and give it a nice hug and it might help you with all that anxiety you're having,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Tony Perez are you upset because your drug dealer got deported,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
FACT: Net immigration has been declining for the last several years.,FACT: Immigrants commit crimes at a lower percentage than American citizens do. Stop spreading propaganda.
Shane McInnes well said bud,Having incompetent Presidents in the past has cost us all......about time someone was looking after those who do the right thing 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
If Mexico stopped sending drugs to America because of a wall, Americans will dig tunnels to Mexico,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Rae Malee Dornick-Walsh that is the most ridiculous thing that I've ever heard!! LOL!!,Andrew Spencer that’s ok just my opinion 👍
Michelle Davidson they are all Russian.  You're Russian. I'm Russian.  If anyone disagrees with this,  it's prob cause you're Russian too.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Bob Segal considering most undocumented folks come through ALL ports of entry, perhaps we should build levees and a giant rooftop over the continental US..  It is not my job to be proactive. That would be the commander-in-cheif's job. My responsibility is to vote accordance to his performance...😬😒   Idk where you got the "no wall" info. It is well known what the Dems have to offer and the wall is apart of the deal. It is the pricetag that goes with it.   And how convenient to place a broken promise 2 years after the fact. You know it was a race baiting sales pitch pipe dream to appeal to the disenfranchised and you know it. And dont try and weasel in anti-obama rhetoric to prove a point. We all know it was a Democratic agenda that was haphazardly dependant on young consumers who are, for the most part, young and healthy.,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Bob Segal idk but I was hoping 1 out of 300m voters could come up with a solution. My solution is the most logical but least popular which is to legalize narcotics, squander cartels, cease citizens uprooting themselves and risking life here, and use that wall $ for rehabs and drug prevention centers.  Let's face it. This whole problem stems from our country snorting and shooting up the issue that ultimately turned our current issue into fruition.  All of this is our fault. I am one of the few who humbly admits it.  And to counter argue your point, getting over, under, and through the wall has also become more advance as well. The wall is an expensive short term simplistic solution.,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Bob Segal or 100% repairing Flint MI some drinking water. Or solve world hunger for a year.  But hey, it is his legacy he wants to taint...🤷‍♂️,$5B wall < $25 ladder
1) just because my offered solution doesnt meet your criteria doesnt inheritly mean I want nothing done. Stop thinking in extremes. You either agree or dont. Either is fine.  2) Seems like the Democrats are trying to meet the president half way which has proven to be fruitless at the expense of Federal worker furloughs.  3) ...I thought Mexico was going to pay for it?,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Bob Segal I just think the wall is a simplified last century solution to a modern problem. I believe in processing folks legally or claiming asylum... which is a human right,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Oh yeah but the 150 billion those illegals cost oh that's not a lot, but by all means bitch about 5 billion,I dont see why we need to have the wall us Americans are making the drugs now ! He's demanding way to much money for the wall and taking money from workings family's and their food stamps how is that good for our country he's attacking us
Says some lefty soy boy, try asking your heroes nancy and chuck about that, oh wait they are all partying in P.R. while all those useful employees await pay lol,Say's the man who won't pay 800,000 of his government employees
Chuck Ellis. We're all fighting the Dems,I'm truly sick of hearing about it. Live up to your word...😎
So, you would rather the dems  give all the tax monies to illegals instead of to vets?? You aren't making any sense! Trump wants the wall so that illegals will stop bleeding us dry so that veterans get care FIRST instead of criminals,I QUESTION, HOW IS ALL THE DIVISION AND THE HATE AND FEAR MONGERING AND EVIL THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? IS THIS “THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE”? GOD BLESS AMERICA? COULD GOD SOON BEGIN TO WONDER WHY? IS AMERICA BECOMING NO LONGER WORTHY? IS THE END NEAR? IT’S TIME TO CHANGE TO PLEASE GOD!
Chammy Ney Ney Jr.  the best ever idiot, if u do not believe. Please google,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
As it is not sea to shiny sea people will go around it, drug barons will use microlights to fly over it. $500 per inch is still ridiculous. Better to use the money at the crossing points for detection and personnel. Is he planning on replacing the existing barriers which are lower than 30ft and have no detection equipment? Where can we see the exact specification for the wall?,5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
Bog Segal Certainly but  if you are paying $500  per inch of wall I am sure it is poor value, especially as walls already exist in the most strategic places. I am not arguing against additional barriers. Trump has claimed down from 2000 miles of wall which was clearly ridiculous as natural barriers exist over much of the border. Why ignore the border with Canada?  How much will it cost to compensate the farmers and other businesses along the wall which will have access to the river removed? If Trump plans to build the wall in the middle of the river that would explain the cost, but a raft upstream could quickly come down either side.  Trump currently said $5.7 billion without releasing the costings or locations. That is a considerable sum to spend on a pig in a poke.,5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
Of course it would. Electronics to track the microlight and agents to intercept where it lands. Why would that not solve the problem,?,5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
Andrew David Johnson - I don't think so, boy.....,We ceased to be as a DECENT nation when your sorry ass took over, but one we toss your worth less behind out, we will come back stronger than ever.

Dumb ass Democrats. Baby killers. Enough said.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Curtis Rice gee Curtis.  Maybe that's because there are more of us...,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Lol comunism? Dang you'll eat everything he feeds you,The borders are secured, you're just desperate for 2020
How about you learn some English. 😏,The Democrats are  just like spoiled children they would rather see this country get over run with criminals drug dealers and terrorist then to help the American people .most are so jealous of trump beating Hillary they will do anything and everything to sabotage his presidency including ruining this country just so they can get what they want it' not about helping it's about control
Lmao wow okay...,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Draft dodging is not serving...,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Donald trump is a President with  good heart and his is working to put things in place,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Everybody cares about his or her own self, but as a president his primary aim suppose to be putting the  needs of the masses first before considering his own need because without the masses who voted for him he will not be in that seat.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Sue Howie no it was about 4 foot tall and my dog gave up. Not all dogs would give up but he did and if the wall stops one criminal, one death then BUILD IT. Its not about Hate.,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls?

How do they know immagration has slowed down? Seems to me alot more has gotten away with entering illegally. Because I knew a girl who dated an illegal and he beat her ass in front of her kids, got arrested...got deported...got released and was back in 3 months. Big cities dont see the problem. Live in a small town and you will see it.,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.

Tyler Dougherty so the same sense would be made for a wall??,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
Hal Bannasch those walls are to keep people in and not out...also, there are guards with guns to shoot the ones trying to escape,Prison walls will keep us safe from you.
Jim Russell cuz it is not an emergency,WHY is declaring a National Emergency to address a National Emergency in The United States considered wrong? There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve “emergencies” in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, "homes of the rich and famous” and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers"  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year." (* 2017, FAIR's)  This does not include cost of loss of life, property, and Democratic stability.
Scott Magers how have u been personally affectes by an illegal? just curious,Janice Beecher I don’t care what they voted against. They contribute to the insecurity of our borders every time they vote against the wall or any other security measures. Politicians should be held accountable for their stupidity and selfishness
Valerie Siggson idiot,The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that
Erin Curry Bayhan he will get paid, but when I put gas in car, buy groceries, pay my mortgage, electric etc they aren’t going to take an IOU. Fortunately we have savings for now, but there are many couples that work at the prison and single parents who need their paycheck. I’m over both sides and the blame game, I just want this to all end. It is a sad day in our country for sure.,Please open the government. My husband has been protecting the public from dangerous inmates and   is working for free. We have two children that we need to feed and provide shelter to! Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.
Timothy Coleman I feel sorry for you go to you youtube and look up yellow vest and then go online and look up Rememberence Project.  Socialist Media won't report it and they lie to you.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Annie Jacobs Stevens Who is going to pay for the wall?,Emil Dörr your actually in that park. I’m self sufficient and more likely providing all your benefits.
Gary Kane oh, Gary, don’t be so gullible. Change the channel once in a while.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Sarah Knutson I don't care what people all over the world think. I care about my country . How about the US stops sending money to other countries, let's see who will be laughing then ?,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Victoria A. Deobald so what?  What is your point? That Prime Minister Trudeau and Arabia are friends?,Victoria A. Deobald so what?  What is your point? That Prime Minister Trudeau and Arabia are friends?
It's why we voted for him to be our President,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don’t want this wall.
I am so worried about the people that have done nothing wrong and all those workers not getting paid those are the Americans that  are legal and loosing houses and cars being punished for nothing they have control over :( deplorables that voted for President Trump .and the disabled loosing their food :( i understand wanting the wall but punishing Americans for it i dont :( worried how this will end . I was one of those deplorables,800,000 workers struggling to pay their bills, food stamps being eliminated for the needy, security of air travel being jeopardized, and our Coast Guard not being paid for life saving and stopping drug smuggling - That’s the Emergency!!!
If we started a go fund me page and everyone who wants the wall donated at least $20 the wall would be no problem,Mr President I agree with you however there are people working without pay meanwhile Congress an Senator's are still being paid so who are you out to punish the American people who voted for you I hope that isn't your intention we love the work you are doing just please don't punish us.
Cinda Beinert we are legion? That’s what the Demon said to Jesus wasn’t it. So Trump supporters are the spawn of Satan? Thanks for clearing that one up.,John Baron the pay is indirect- and he has kept more campaign promises than any other politician in my lifetime
Gary Abbott no, it’s worse.,June Norrell who me? Or him? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8AAMho5cUxHl28zc1H--jEKUDteyuX7/view

Tanya Pittman AMEN SISTA,What's more important to Democrats you ask? Getting you out of office and a real president in. One that is not a liar, crook, and Russian/North Korea lover; one who doesn't think they are a dictator and one who upholds the constitution (and has read it) and don't think he's above the law. That's what important to Democrats...restoring the office of the president of the United States!
Michèle Biwer-Erpelding how about we start taking care of our homeless and veterans who are also living on our streets. How about you listening to all the "angel families" stories , how about you take the illegal into your home and you take care of them ?  You are so blind,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Omar Martinez yes, I want border security.....not a border wall.  I lived in El Paso for years and just moved.  There is NO CRISIS on our borders!!!!!  And you know it.  So what’s your agenda?  Just don’t want to go back to your homeland?  And you want to Not give this opportunity to ones just like you?!,trump I want border security.  trump I do NOT WANT A WALL.  Tell your brain to listen to the American people WE DO NOT WANT AN INEFFECTIVE COSTLY WALL
Sue Schuster Aalykke I prefer he not keep ANY promise regarding that wall. Border security does not equal a wall.,Ann Parish Harper I agree.  Mexico would rightly never pay for a border wall.  I was being sarcastic.You can see what I wrote on his facebook page tonight.
Guy?  Get an education and add-on some and political science coursework to that.  Your comments don't even exceed junior high-level.  Wait, scratch steps 1 and 2.  Build up that single-digit-I.Q... THEN... all the other will fall into place more readily~,Vicki Zamow he let in the country.

Angela Wilson go check the facts Angela. Reaching out to help those refugees does not make country that does that a socialist country. That is the Christian thing to do. For trump to use those refugees to frighten Americans is absolutely scandalous. Shame on trump for doing it, shame on his followers who are buying it.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.

Barby Bird only children and immature people hate Barby. You appear to be confusing opposition with hate. I do agree with you there does seem to be a sense of immaturity in the White House, but that of course has nothing to do with the Democrats. They are opposing trump’s willingness to squander Americans hard earned taxes. trump has promised the Mexicans would fund his wall, so why does he need the Democrats to approve? Makes no sense at all.,The replies from Pelosi and Schumer were filled with hate, outright lies and malice.  Their extreme hatred for President Trump is overriding their responsibility to the American people.  We need to protect ourselves and we can only do that with a border.  Nancy and Chuck can take their lies back to their lairs.  Anyone with half a brain can see through the dems.
Brent Robinson  They don’t care how many people die? Where are you getting your information from Brent?  They?  Who are they? They can’t allow to keep fulfilling his campaign promises?  What are you talking about?  trump has had two years time and the support of both houses and he couldn’t get his promised wall built. Neither has he collected the funds he promised he would from Mexico.  The state of trump’s approval is all down to himself and no one else.  Those who oppose trump are not traitors Brent, they simply think he is not fit for office.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Clint Backhaus nothing else to do Clint? If that is the case, why don’t you contact the man who is, not only happy but proud, to have government workers go without their pay cheque. If you cannot get trump in the White House, try his golf course in Florida,Nancy Pelosis phone # is 202-225-4965 call her and voice your concerns. I just did. I asked her if she would take a drug test....the phone went silent and then started beeping all weird. It's sad the way they treat you President Trump. Schumer could never do a deal like you and he knows it. Looked like a trouble teenager in the principals office the other day with you. Democrats cant get rich on their own like you did. They need to steal and lie to get anywhere. Schumer's a rat that needs to go to the nursing home or find a trap. His number is 202-224-7433 but he's too much of a coward to answer.
Colleen Kandra that’s all you got Colleen?,Nancy Pelosis phone # is 202-225-4965 call her and voice your concerns. I just did.

Corinn Elizabeth no Corinn that’s not true, you might. Speak for yourself,Ann de Roo-Daly sorry smart isnt your strong point. But here, only you,  wendy whats-her-face, and the legendary henk  are haters that need attention.  Since it's necessary to point it out to you. Go talk to that murder suspect hillary
Diane Mathieu you might think this is about defeating trump, but that is not the case. trump could have had his wall built already. He had both houses and two years time to do it. What stopped him? It’s clear he never had the backing, not from congress and not from the Republican party, but now he wants the Democrats to back the plan his own party wouldn’t. That is ridiculous!,Just build the wall. Those opposed will never change their minds. Its all about defeating Trump. Dont give them that! Most are behind you!
Jerry Risner with both houses of congress since trump took office two years ago, he couldn’t get the wall funded. Could that be because he lied about Mexico paying for it? How many times was he filmed saying that? Who knows, but he had his chance and blew it,Arev Neerg i'm sure your stern message will change his ways. the dems. plan of let them all in isn't a border security plan
Joseph Saab If trump had kept his promise he wouldn’t need the American taxpayers money, he would have collected the funds from Mexico, he hasn’t. He needs to keep that promise Joseph,Ann de Roo-Daly he already did with nafta....
LeeAnn Leonard we? No LeeAnn, you might be, but you cannot speak for other Americans,We are standing with you President Trump! DO NOT backdown, MANY are praying for you!
Roberta Anastasia  she isn’t making it up,Amy Miller you are making this up. I am from a military family and we are heartsick over how this draft dodger has ruined this country and now causing hardship to ours.

Jess Castrejón has that not been addressed? Their are laws against drinking and driving already.,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.

Webster Lynn Vi but the wall won’t keep stop most illegal immigration- mist fly in and overstay visas. I would rather our taxpayer dollars to sorting that out than building a silly wall that people can tunnel under, cut or climb over.,I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can’t fool everyone. Open the government !
Bonnie Elwood McMillin there’s 3 branches of government - seems like the recent election results in congress indicate a different point of view that also needs to be considered. Trump also said Mexico would pay for the wall- it’s a big difference to now ask the American tax payer to fund a $5 billion vanity project,I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can’t fool everyone. Open the government !

Judy Goebel Donny is sealing his fate as a one-term president!  Bwahahahahaha!!  Talk about obvious statements...EVERYONE agrees we need border security.  What we don’t need is his cost-ineffective wall.  Donny needs to agree to the bipartisan deal already passed by Congress so his shutdown does not completely destroy our economy.  Just give it up now and reopen our government!!!  Trump doubles down on border wall, as polls show voters turning against his shutdown strategy  https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doubles-down-on-border-wall-as-polls-show-voters-turning-against-his-shutdown-strategy,Amen! Thank you for all you do.  Hang in there. We are counting on you.
Linda Durbin One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  “Nobody’s done the job that we’ve done on the border, “ said Donny as he declares a national emergency today........the slowest emergency in history.  And with the lawsuits that will ensue, his wall will not be funded or built until after the next election...if ever.  THE WORLD’S SLOWEST EMERGENCY!!!!!  Donny lied directly to Americans about his “border crisis.”  Our Liar-in-Chief said that all the data that refutes his crisis designation is lies.  Got that?  Our president told the American people that THE FACTS ARE LIES...this is what all wannabe dictators say.  This egomaniac is THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  Donny doesn’t seem terribly concerned about this “crisis.”  He plans to travel to Florida mere hours after declaring the emergency from the White House. A president, in times of strife, would typically stay in the nation’s capital to oversee the crisis. Donny plans to do so from the comfort of his weekend getaway.  In reality, Donny is preparing the country for a fake war as he plans to enjoy a mini vacation. The only national emergency in America right now is one of leadership!!,Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens! 🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️

That shipped sailed long ago. You guys need a new tune....lol
What total ignorance!  That wall will not stop the terrorism that will arrive on American soil after we cede control of the Mideast to Russia.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Democrats need to wake up!  I don't think their images of going to Hawaii, or Puerto Rico and having a grand time while government personnel aren't working/getting paid look too good.  Also saying that you don't like Trump's last offer before it was offered and gave you 4 out of 5 things you wanted looks good either.  Americans are smarter than you think; they know who is keeping the government shut down.  OPTICS, people!,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Chris Jordan G Mark Morgan border patrol chief under Obama has been on the news saying we need the wall.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

What an idiot,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Buck Strunk yes. We have. Now see what is happening... 😶 Crime overall,No other country has open borders why should we
Marcus Nizza it is a Desaster.,No other country has open borders why should we
When our country is attacked by China or Russia because his puerile tactics make our once strong country look like a laughing stock to all the world, I want you to tell me again the he is a great president.   He is making our country the fool of the world by running it like the moronic clown he is.   You're as delusional as he is.  If you're not terrified then you're as much of a fool as he is.,Fake President.
I take it you don't understand a marginal tax rate. That's okay a lot of people don't.,your promise was that taxpayers would not pay for the wall. We're among you to hold to your promise. Also, find a way to pay for it. Maybe a 70% tax on income over $10 million?
Paul Chiplock North Carolina seems to want the wall.,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don’t want this wall.
Maximus Herrera i wouldn't try  it the rednecks don't take things lightly and you wouldn't like the ending if you tried ask one.,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
Carl Ostendarp at least he didn't have a big party and our boys in bengezi wasn't important enough for him or hillary to try and get them help! i call  BS BS BS at least the man does answer when called no matter where he is.,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.

no what is petty it you not understanding that this child wass taken by someone who shouldn't have been here in the first place.  so don't say it is an illegal thing when that is who killed there child.  see if you can get the congress or senate to pass a stiff law for anyone drinking and driving it won't happen cause they are the ones who are doing it all the time and walk away.  don't blame this parent =,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
hummm maybe you might need to learn to be a better driver with all those wrecks.  just saying seems like it is always someone elses fault 2 sides to a story,Annette Keller I used to drive for a living, and spent a lot of hours on the road. I'm sure the people who crashed into me had their side of the story, but the police who investigated agreed with my side. If you can tell me how it was my fault a woman ran into the back of me while I was at a red light, I'd be glad to listen. What do I know, maybe turned off her lights and sped off away from the scene because she had to use the bathroom really bad. Innocent people do that all the time.

Sandy Green Amen sister!,Protect the border. Protect Americans. BUILD THE WALL
it's amazing how he was deported but managed to get back to the US, managed to get a car and drive around!!!! omg how could the authority let him do that so freely??? the state should be sued for this!,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL

They are claiming multiple nieces and nephews that are out of the United States and have never lived here. We have to have social security numbers to claim our children. Why aren't they receiving a number for their children that they have in the United States for them to claim? Why do they not have to prove that a child lives here? The amount of money they are receiving on the child tax credit is insane and should be stopped and some kind of proof needs to be provided to show that that child lives here. 😖

Read this John Mutyaba :  “False Says Sen. Chuck Schumer in 2014 "helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall" and now opposes Trump's $5 billion request for a border wall "just because he's a Republican." ​ — Bloggers on Monday, December 17th, 2018 in a blog post Meme mischaracterizes Chuck Schumer's record on border security funding  By John Kruzel on Thursday, December 20th, 2018 at 11:10 a.m.  A meme gaining traction on social media claims Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., supported a border wall deal during Barack Obama’s presidency but then flip-flopped once President Donald Trump took the White House.  The post contains a photo of Schumer and a mock first-person confession revealing the Senate minority leader’s partisan reason for the apparent policy pivot.  "In 2014, I helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall," reads the post from a group called The Right View Of Washington State. "Now, Trump wants $5 billion for a border wall. Well I’m gonna b----, cry, piss and moan just because he’s a Republican and wants it."  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The meme is swimming in factual errors and fishy interpretations.  No border wall deal in 2014 The post says Schumer helped put together a border wall deal in 2014. That’s wrong — there was no border barrier deal that year.  It’s possible the creator of the post was thinking of a 2013 proposal that Schumer shepherded through the Senate. But characterizing the 2013 legislation as a $25 billion deal to fund a "border wall" runs into factual hurdles.  That proposal, a comprehensive immigration plan Schumer sponsored and voted for, cleared the Senate in 2013. But the Republican-controlled House did not take up that bill after that. (It’s worth noting that presidents, not lawmakers, as the meme suggests, sign bills into law.)  The package included more than $46 billion for border security. The vast majority of that money ($30 billion) was for hiring more U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. Around $8 billion would have gone toward building or repairing 700 miles of fencing (including some double-layer fencing) along the U.S.-Mexico border.  That’s not $25 billion for a wall, as the meme claimed.  Fence vs. wall It would be a stretch to say the fencing Schumer supported in 2013 fits the same description as Trump’s "impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall," with "precasts going up probably 35 to 40 feet in the air."  Schumer’s office insisted a border fence is very different from Trump’s promised wall. The senator’s office pointed us to a Trump tweet from the election when then-candidate Trump scolded his opponent Jeb Bush for conflating the two.  "Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a ‘fence.’ " Trump tweeted. "It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!"  Daniel Yoken, a Schumer spokesman, said, "Sen. Schumer supported fencing where it makes sense then and still does today."  Schumer has also argued that border security isn’t limited to a wall, and that there are other, more effective ways to secure the border. The meme claims Schumer opposes a wall "just because" Trump is a Republican.  One more point to clarify: Schumer in January 2018 said he offered to back funding for Trump’s border wall in exchange for a broader immigration package that included a deal for so-called Dreamers, young immigrants living in the country illegally.  Schumer reportedly made a $25 billion offer for the wall during a private meeting with Trump, as lawmakers negotiated a way to avert a government shutdown. Schumer rescinded his offer just a few days after making it, saying it was off the table because Trump rejected the broader immigration package.  The New York Times reported that while the White House refused to acknowledge that Schumer made the wall offer, Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle confirmed it.  An offer on behalf of Schumer’s part to fund a border wall undermines the meme’s notion that he’s automatically ruled out the wall simply because Trump wants it.  Our ruling The Facebook post says Schumer in 2014 "helped put together and signed a $25 billion deal to fund a border wall" and now opposes Trump's $5 billion request for a border wall "just because he's a Republican."  There are numerous factual errors here: there was no border barrier deal in 2014. A 2013 legislative package proposed $8 billion for border fencing — not $25 billion for a border wall.  More importantly, the border fencing Schumer backed in 2013 is different than how Trump has described his border wall. And the meme glosses over Schumer’s previous support for border wall funding earlier this year, in exchange for protections for Dreamers.  We rate this post False.”,Patton---Yeah and that electrical grid can be tampered with by terrorist's sneaking in through unsecured border miles!!! Use your brain!
Yay, finally an intelligent American !!!  My message to Donald Trump :   “Sure, border security !!! But that does not necessarily mean a 5 billion dollar wall !!! The Democrats also want border security ... but not the 5 billion dollar wall that you are proposing for border security !!! You need to learn how to negotiate and compromise !!! You are used to bullying until you get your own way !!! You have no respect or consideration for the other people with whom you are negotiating !!! You are 71 but you act like a child who hasn’t learned that he cannot always have his own way !!! You need to grow up !!! I hope the Democrats don’t let you get away with your bullying ways so that you may learn how to be a mature individual !!! Otherwise you need to be removed from circulation because people like you are a menace and not worthy of living in society with other people ...”,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.

Let's see how long you'll be willing to go furloughed for. You'll break.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

You have proven my point with your responses.  That's the best you can do?,This isn't Trump's shut down, it's Putin's shut down.  Trump is doing Putin's bidding by crippling our society by its foundation.  Can't you see that Trump is tearing us apart by the seams, he divides us, propelling our young to animalistic hate.  Does this make you feel good?

Dianna Adams Ewen - If you are referring to the "new trade agreement with Mexico" that has never been ratified by Congress and therefore has never taken effect, no it does not make any provision for Mexico funding any phony walls, directly or indirectly.  And no I never thought Mexico was going to write a check.  I am not as stupid as your "president"  who said precisely that, or his voters who were stupid enough to believe him when he said it and believe him again when he claimed he never said it.,Hey pussy-grab, remember that time you told us Mexico was going to pay for the wall?

And I had my vehicle cracked into in a parking space, causing substantial damage, by an Asian immigrant who had decided he could squeeze into it in back of me for some bizarre reason.  He spoke no English, had no idea of American rules of the road, had no insurance, and was driving a car not registered to him. Where do we put the wall to keep those like him away?,My mom was hit by an illegal immigrant and he tried to drive off. He pulled out in front of her and totaled her car. On another occasion my dad was hit by one going the wrong way and drunk on the highway. Totaled his car and hurt him pretty bad.

Funny you should mention El Paso...isn;t that the city with some kind of wall that was put up on the grounds it would way lower crime rates...but the city was already among the safest in the country and its wall didn't lower crimes rates...?,My heart weeps for them, and agree. Hopefully the people that El Paso is building units for, until they get processed won't be that. It's being told it's for Women and Children and the fact is that its more male than female or children. But you are all we got and you have the answers but sure don't agree with it but will back you...
Ward Karsman Well, let's just do a fact check on ONE of your list...Robert Byrd was honored by the NAACP after his death, because of his tireless work for civil rights.  I understand English can be tough when its not your native language, so let me explain that NAACP is an acronym -it's made up of the first letters of the words in the title of an organization- meaning "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People".,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Not a bad thought.  It should be part of a discussion of best ways to address any problem.,My son was killed by a drunk driver also. That man was from Long Island New York. Should we put a wall there too? Odds are in the years both of us lost our kids to drunk drivers the majority of them were born & raised in the USA. Does one death matter less because of the who or where they were from?  Yes laws need to be enforced all the way around but especially on the employers that hire undocumented workers.Something so many neglect to mention or enforce. Seems even Trump branded businesses like to hire the undocumented.  Not sure a wall in the middle of the desert would make much of a difference. Ports of entry, towns, cities is different.  Everyone agrees something needs to be done just some of us see the wall as a waste of money from a man that promised Mexico would pay for it. Maybe use fines imposed on businesses that use undocumented labor illegally to pay for a wall where it would be most effective.

Renee Korabiak Ah huh...let's not foget the multiple deliberate attempts on people Fauxtus considers enemies...ie deliberate actions taken to target and plan and physically obtain lethal items them deployed in attempts to kill them with malice aforethought, not some random guy trying to grab someone else's gun.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Try taking a good look at the northern border.  No wall.  Other methods. Terrific security.  And they aren't working on stopping poor terrified people trying to get away from conflicts we are partly responsible for...they are trying to make sure nobody gets to us through them and pulls another 9/11.  This wall is a waste of money.,The wall along with better technology, more personal, etc will all work together as our CBP has recommended.  We need to include more drug sniffing dogs.  They do a great job.
Linda, here in the US oldsters who spend 60% plus of their time watching TV, talking on the phone, tweeting nonsense, golfing, and traveling to golfing vacations and rah rahs are called "retirees.",Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens! 🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️
Anna Sophia Wheland I am sure you have decided to believe that not banning guns -and not having sensible, enforced gun laws either- would save more lives, but facts have already proven your belief to be wrong.,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Michael Thompson Let's compare.  I'll let you look up the number of people actually dead from far right shootings/stabbings in teh US vs from undocumented shootings/stabbings in the US just during trump's term to date.  I know you wouldn;t believe the facts if I looked them up for you; but I can give you a hint: the far right victims are higher...,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?

Wondering why exactly?  I mean, since there was no national emergency then, either...but maybe you just meant to point out that if there had ever been one obviously the GOP would have had the trophy wall erected LONG ago, so it's blatantly clear there is no national emergency.,Art Jackson  Dear... The problem of immigrants before the elections before 2016... The problem is outdated... But at the beginning of 2017... Congress was Republican... The wall and its problems will not affect the 2020 elections... Like now... On the contrary it will be positive... and other things...
No, it is not possible.  You can see for yourself by looking back, trump's wall idea was never something the majority wanted.,The Mexican drug cartels have a lot of money and they know how to invest it to maximize their illegal profits. During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.  Is it possible that cartel money is now being used to change public opinion and the politicians opinions on the construction of the border wall between Mexico and the United States? I am just wondering now……
It's really great for you and your like-minded friends to identify yourselves as happy to see the US Constitution under attack.,Sheikh F Shahel hello

On the contrary, it is a broken tool that would not have done much anyway even when whole; you don;t use broken already inadequate but REALLY expensive tools to address a problem when you have tools that are whole, work well, and cost much less.,It's one tool Lori Olson Rasmann, you need to use all ways to stop the problem. Just because it doesn't solve the whole problem does not mean you shouldn't address the issue.

You meant to write something about the kickbacks from all those for-profit detention companies and all those contractors, I'm sure, since we all know Fauxtus has shattered both foreign and domestic emoluments clauses numerous times.,The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that
John Wheeler what do you want him to do give in get no border protection allow the illegal aliens to do what they want ? Do you realize how much it costs us now to care for those lazy selfish illegals that look for a free ride everywhere the go?

Mind=blown,So by Donald Dumbs logic the united states never was a nation because it never had a huge wall next to Mexico. Seems legit.
The wall is pointless. They will still get through and trump is making it seem like immigrants are the main problem committing crimes etc when it's our own American people!,The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!

My daughter had a friend down there whose father was found in the Rio Grande and the drones had to go find him. Hmmm safe, yeah right.,My heart weeps for them, and agree.

After that, lets see what is he going to do with all the murders of this side of the wall.,Prayers for everyone who have lost loved ones because of illegal aliens. This is absolutely insane. Thankfully, I don't know anyone who has been harmed by an illegal but I am still for the wall. Walls are good. Walls help with many things. The people against to wall are - well, I won't put it in print - but one day it's going to affect them and we'll see how their opinion is then. So many people hate this president more than they love their country. God bless the friends and family affected and God bless our president and those trying to help.
Joseph Nobles:   Yes, we had the House and Senate.  From day one of this Presidency Chuck (Senator) minority in Senate and Nancy (house) minority,  vowed to not work with the president.  Look back to Chuck saying, before any name was mentioned for Supreme Court said Dems would not vote to confirm. They made fools, during the hearing, of themselves. Remember we now need 60 votes in Senate to pass anything further.  Chuck said No Way do Dems vote yes to anything!!   😡😡😡😡,Karol L Smith BUDGET RECONCILIATION DOESN'T NEED 60 VOTES! JUST A SIMPLE MAJORITY! TIME TO GET A NEW CIVICS BOOK!!! Geez Louise.

Danny Jones you know what I want you to refund me the portion that goes from my taxes to this bloody wall because I don't want the pay for it.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Didn't u guys Brexit from the EU yet?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Robert Cee wow you must be living in the twilight zone.  Here in the USA the urban dwellers are the takers.  They will not speak for the rest of the country nor should they.  People in big cities are ignorant of life outside of their little bubbles and can't think or do things for themselves.  Amazon just got run out of New York because of socialist A-holes who live in a fantasy world of progressive idiocy.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Robert Cee you're an idiot if you think you "don't need" Amazon.  How do you think you're going to afford The Green New Deal?  YOU CAN'T!  You progs are delusional socialist douches who like to confiscate OTHER PEOPLE'S wealth and use it how YOU see fit, like a dictator.  And  you couldn't survive without a safety net because da gubment is your daddy.  One other thing...if not for big business and tourism in NYC supporting you liberal takers NYC would be a giant slum.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Robert Cee yeah I do. He actually does what he says!  Oh and where's your impeachment for Russian collusion?  LoL epic fucktardedness,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
NO WALL TALKS UNTIL DONALD J TRUMP & MITCH MCCONNELL OPEN UP THE GOVERNMENT. AMERICAN CITIZENS DO NOT ALLOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PLAY YOYO WITH YOU & YOUR FAMILIES LIFE. DONALD J TRUMP WILL DO THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNLESS THIS "MADMAN DONALD J TRUMP" IS STOPPED. #NOHELLHOWALL DONALD J TRUMP IS A LIAR AND IN BED WITH PUTIN AND RUSSIANS LEADER AND IN DEBT! DONALD J TRUMP IS A TRAITOR TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND JUST LIKE MELANIA'S JACKET SAID "THEY REALLY DON'T CARE, DO YOU! #CHANGETHECHANNEL #GETWOKE #STOPTHISMADMAN,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Norene Boone aren't those bills without the wall? I don't know about everyone, but I think we need the wall.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
He just offered a compromise that was rejected by Pelosi. He has tried.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.

Laura Holland most illegals fly into America according to the statistics,Marcie Pavy what is then?
Bobb Marly it's still not 100% foolproof and we don't have an unsecured border like the tRumpsters like to call it..tell those that patrol it that it's unsecured,You better worry what's coming through our airports and ports of entry
But true Norma Beran.,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Why is it ok for Melanoma to be in Florida?,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Try spelling lessons.,It is pass the time to inform Nancy  what to do ..........it is time to DEMAND her to build the wall or else
Barbara Hill where did you get your stats that trafficking was as a direct result of illegal immigrants entering at illegal points of entry?? Or are you like trump, spewing alternative facts???!!,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Buck Strunk clearly you don’t know what is going on. The States does NOT have “open borders”. Do your homework,No other country has open borders why should we
Joel Bernardini why are you such a bully??? Daddy issues or mommy not love you, better yet lacking in the lower region?? It’s easy to be an asshole (as I’ve just demonstrated).,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Mike Keck what the hell does that have to do with the shut down??? Do your RESEARCH majority of murders against Americans are by Americans!!!,I bet every Angel Mom would go without a paycheck in exchange for having their child back!
Robert White protect us from what??!! In the last two years the largest most violent attack was by an American to Americans!!! What happened to the “scary immigrants “ that were on their way to rape and pillage prior to November elections??? Crickets... because as usual trump uses alternative facts and fear to rally people like yourself on board. Investigate on your own and then chime in trump has enough parrots within the senate!!,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
Samuel González how many times have you needed to have a ten foot wall around your house for protection???,Barbara. When I was in Puerto Rico I had to move my family to a gated community surrounded by a 12' wall and an armed guard at the gate. Gracias.
Worley Michael we shall see.,Mr. President, stand your ground in order to protect our country. Americans are with you.  God bless the USA

Lee N Kristen Wilcox instead of lashing out why don't you answer the question,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Buck Strunk I guess you're unaware that we do not have open borders buck. We have barriers in place in certain areas and the border patrol is doing a fantastic job. This is all a scare tactic that you believe from your president. I never want to hear the word wall again because everybody's obsessed with it,No other country has open borders why should we
Tim Christ you are a politician moron,Barbara Blitfield Pech sorry but I am not a politician, and I am not a moron, BTW what is a politician moron?   So exactly what was wrong with the post I made, I know that I did not believe very much of what Bill Clinton, or Barack Obama promised, they lived up to my expectations!  So far most of what Trump can deliver on his promises, he has delivered, he has not yet delivered on promises that are dependent on congress and treasonous democrats, Trump has integrity, or he never would have succeeded as a business man.   We have a long history of liberal democrats lying to the people, and not giving a damn if they keep their promises.   Up until now the problem with republicans is they do not have the balls to fight the traitors known as democrats, that is until Trump!   Oh if possible name 10 democrat politicians with integrity, who are actively working for the American people, and not just shouting Heil Hussein when their leaders tell them to!
Abby Schmidt The Immigrants....in the town might be different in todays world there.     Just seeing and saying.....,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Fred Dickey Oh! Bless your little heart Freddy! You’re adorable!  Longest shutdown in history! Biggest deficit in history! And a failed reality TV star President who has lied more than any President in history. Enjoy. More Republicans are turning against the politically motivated so-called crisis that just one month ago Trump Tweeted “the border is now secure”! Buckle up Fred. Contribute to that go fund me and chill. You’ve been suckered, so Donald would be thrilled with you.,Fred Dickey Oh! Bless your little heart Freddy! You’re adorable!  Longest shutdown in history!

I hope you are taking down walls in your home, leaving your doors unlocked and taking illegals in. Come on, where’s your hearts??,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Reduce human trafficking, build it 🇺🇸,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
www.humantraffickingsearch.com confirms this horrible epidemic ❤️,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
I got my facts at: www.humantraffickingsearch.com which confirms this horrible epidemic ❤️,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Yes Lawrence and Karen, they can still use boats or tunnels. However a fence is the biggest barrier to discourage and reduce people from entering illegally.,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Happy birthday, Patriot Logan!,Today is my birthday. I'd like a wall to be built please. Thanks!
Wow......  Bet you like those child tax credits...  Ken....,Remember Obamacare repeal? Republican House and Senate, Republican president, and Donald whiffed, twice. As I said, the Democrats are not the reason he constantly fails.
Bonita Selzler they have tried.  He has painted himself into a corner where he is unable to negotiate.,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Daniel Bennett wrong. Try get some facts,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Richard Smith for the party that claims law and order you sure don’t seem to know much about either,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1155510014605234&id=227505360917068
Abby Schmidt who cares who pays for it I don’t all I know to many Americans have lost so much due to the illegal immigrants that have know right to be here invading our country and our security the has to build the wall,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Awe Cheryl I feel for ya . But being willfully ignorant is so bad for the rest of us so stop it.,I feel so sad that you Mr. President have to take so much from the CORRUPT and EVIL Dems, but I THANK YOU for Putting Our Country FIRST !!!!
Jan McClendon Carter u got that right. They continue to get their pay & it’s not right.  Others are having to do without. We the people are the ones that put them in office & we just have to sit aside & let those scum bags do what they want, but something is going to have to give & some things need to be changed in Congress.,Donald J. Trump does congress still get paid during a shut down? You are so right in saying most of them have fences or protection around their mansions so what is the difference? Also they brought up spending on equipment adding man power who do they think will pay for this? It’s not about a wall for them it’s about getting their way!
I'm so sorry. I pray you will somehow be able to survive all the heartbreaking dynamics of  this absolutely horrible loss of your precious son. The Democrats have gone mad, and this is causing us so much grief and worry. My heartbreaks for you and your family, and I pray for you all and our country.,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Apple Rivera if this story is even true, which I doubt, because Enterprise would have told you that whoever they rented that truck to is responsible for any loss or damage incurred by that truck.  You did get the licence plate from the truck, didn't you?    And guess what ijit, if you rent a truck from Enterprise, a car from Hertz, etc, and you let anyone drive it that is not on the contract YOU signed, your butt is responsible.,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, “Daniel Zuniga” who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didn’t take responsibility because they said they didn’t contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found. Find all underground tunnels coming into the US.  #BUILDtheWALL President Trump 🇺🇸
Sally Gillespie Bailey do you think our TSA agents are not effective.   I am insulted. Doing our job every day without a paycheck,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!
John Decker so they are legally here., That will catch up with them.,My heart and prayers go out to all the victims! And if you think about it ,aren't all legal hard working Americans victims? They come here and abuse our law and order, our resources , our job opportunities, our taxes that should be used to benefit Americans who are struggling! They broke our laws and we are paying the price.  Build that wall!

Steven Anargyros "we?"....um NO. YOU are with him and yelling about it,Barbara Warrell Jones yep. Kind of excited that we finally have someone in Washington that will do things for the Country.
Larrydon't forgot to say why Reagan withheld the money.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Right. Just like the pallets of cash dropped in the middle if the bight to Iran.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Edward Miller all presidents lie. Why didn't you say anything about the last one,Last I checked, Mexican border has remained the same since the 1850s, and we've seemed to get by. Illegal border crossings have steadily declined since the 1970s.  I'm trying to understand why now we have an "emergency", or "crisis"..  I thought healthcare was a crisis, that was going to be "so easy" to fix, and was going to be fixed on your first day, what happened??  Seems the great negotiator,  you're NOT!!!   You have said many, many times over the years, that a government shutdown is the president's fault, it shows their lack of ability to negotiate.   WELL?????

Well this article asked actual people who live on the border, deal with this made up crisis and they say No. I'll take their word over the word of someone making a living off of border security. Pretty sure the people getting paid have an alternative motive to their opinions.,Trump will have to confront one of the biggest challenges in building support for his wall: The people who live on the border say there is no national emergency and they don’t want a wall.  https://truthout.org/articles/mayor-of-texas-border-town-trumps-wall-is-pointless/Mayor of Texas Border Town: There is No Crisis Here, Trump's Wall is Pointlesstruthout.org
Your pathetic lesbian bias has been noted.  So we're going to call it a heavy duty fence.     You've never built anything, and you're not tearing anything down.     Remove your front door,  minion.,you mean a wall?
He has the right to call up the Citizen Militia tonight.   Just as the founding fathers set it up.   The largest land-based army on earth.    A minimum of about 350 million guns, and far more than 25 trillion rounds of ammo.   It may be far more.    And the  vast majority of the soldiers and police will stand with us.   They still stand up to their oaths.,Wake me up when the shootin starts.
Why you say that?,Will Titus That might be one of the dumbest things I’ve heard

Build the wall!  Another illegal murders Americans:  https://www.kolotv.com/content/news/Two-people-found-dead-in-south-Reno-home-504465091.html,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
You look it up.  Socialism is defined as the next step TOWARDS communism.,The communist agenda was at their finger tips when you disrupted them.  Had Hillary won the USA would have been full blown communist.  On board all the way with you
Hello here,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
You a bot?,What about the far larger amount of legals killing legals? I can go to a bar on any given night and witness a bunch of people driving off over the legal limit. Beyond drunk driving, legal citizens of the U.S. are far more likely to commit crimes statistically. What are we doing for the far lager amount of people hurt by legals?
you gotta love people who delete there comments...lol,Mr. Trump, No Americans dont want border security, they want you gone as president. Your a entertainer. Not a politician. You are making the presidency a entertainment place  Which many Americans are hurting because of your ways
You are right, but darkness does not like the way President Trump's light shines.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Peggy Adams he can speak on it,Eric Wroblewski thank you
"I’m shutting down the government. I’ll own the shutdown. I’m proud to carry the mantle." - Donald, 2018  Now it is the Democrat's fault? Ha!!! I guess that pride turned to shame. Thrice-married cheats always lie. Draft dodgers are always lame. President bone spur is no patriot, just another selfish billionaire egomaniac, a NY drama queen still thinking he is on "reality" TV.  “A shutdown falls on the President’s lack of leadership. He can’t even control his party and get people together in a room. A shutdown means the President is weak” - Donald, 2013,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Donald, a thrice-married cheat, has a credibility problem. He asked for $1.6 billion, appropriations committee said "OK", then he said nevermind make it $5 billion, House said "OK", then he said actually $5.7 billion PLUS let's shutdown the government, and he struck no deals until the opposing party took the House away January 3. YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH LIARS.  So forget Donald, he is just fooling around. He's changed the terms before and he'll do it again, so just bypass him with a veto-proof majority.  Why? Because air traffic controllers. Because ICE. Because US Coast Guard. Because TSA. Because America is open for business, even if president bone spur isn't.  Veto-proof majority, just bypass the useless lying cheating bone spur.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.

10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle.

Diane Smith I know alot of people that  were democrats that are going to vote for our POTUS,because they have seen how the democrats have lost their minds. I was a Democrat up untill Obama got elected. I'm so glad I'm for a party now that has common sense instead of stupidity,love for our country instead of trying to destroy it.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Dems are as dumb as a box of rocks.They wouldn't know an emergency if it hit them in the face. Nothing but a bunch of Satanist .,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.

They are spending $192 MILLION for a facility for illegals.  This is outrages.  Send them home!,Why isn’t mexico paying for it? 😂😂😂 damn y’all dumb 😂😂
We need a Class Action Lawsuit to stop this invasion and forcing us to pay for it.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Emily Neal underground weapons🙄 will always make it into the hands of criminals thus we don’t need to make laws making it harder for upstanding citizens with no record to own them!,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.

Anne Crossway a bill that offers billions to other countries abortion and no wall here, you mean that offer?,Build the wall. Stay strong, President Trump!
Michael Fuerst what a stupid statement but hey lets use his money to build the wall! https://www.wibc.com/blogs/chicks-right/ted-cruz-has-way-pay-wall-el-chapo-act?fbclid=IwAR3__SBIZ73hPiF8xTYLw_jTuWtQ47fTlrHccSWBuROpuIILyMlVUycqV8I,Build the wall. Stay strong, President Trump!
Anne Crossway I'm going to trust the EXPERT Border Patrol agents that say they NEED a wall to funnel people to the ports of entry and will aide in the use of other technology, rather than your opinion. SMH,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Kelly Cross and apparently you are enjoying the suffering of the Angel Moms and are truly not concern with ONE more Angel Mom being added to the list! Shameful!,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Kenneth Armstrong or by NOT doing it, it could add ONE more Angel Mom to the list and irreparable damage to life!,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
Anne Crossway you are only kidding yourself. People are switching parties because of Pelosi! Yeah!,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.

Araceli Rodriguez well YOU are INFORMED about the Angel Mom's right? You support even ONE more be added to the list! Shameful!,You are one in million and million in one. Love you Trump ❤❤
Jim MacKey A lot of those children come over unaccompanied or with people not even related, hence child traffickers.  They are not in Internment camps more like encampments, meaning they are in a place with temporary accommodations. SMH,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Jim MacKey Ha because I had a great job and career with the government, it was a non issue, we got paid just like these folks will.  When you were laid off did you get back paid?  did you get free food and other support?  If so, great right?,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Jim MacKey LOL I am very real thank you, I have been furloughed at least a couple of times.  The reality is these folks are getting free food and many resources not afforded to private sectors that get laid off, PLUS they WILL be paid.,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Jim MacKey and it takes a heartless person to want ONE more Angel Mom added to the list, knowing these 800,000 people will be paid.,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Jim MacKey what a stupid statement, he is already showing compassion. Pelosi wont even meet with the Angel Moms, SMH,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Jim MacKey yep couple times lol,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Jim MacKey yes lol,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Jim MacKey you mean like Pelosi not meeting with the Angel Moms?,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Chris Jordan G speaking of babies, you certainly do not care if another baby is trafficked or another Angel Mom is added to the list, shameful!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Michèle Biwer-Erpelding unless your child was not murdered by an "illegal" immigrant why would you be heartless and uncaring? You support another Angel Mom be added to the list. Shameful,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

Brian Holmes What a sinful and abusive way to use prayer. YOU go to church and pray there is NOT another Angel Mom added to the list!  Then ask forgiveness for your heartless self!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Michèle Biwer-Erpelding what a stupid statement,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Chris Jordan G keep showing yourself. People like you are why people are changing parties🤣🤣🤣😂😂,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Chris Jordan G those children are not dead! A lot of them were unaccompanied and some were with people smuggling them over. But no sense in talking to someone who supports child trafficking and heartless who doesnt care if measures are taken to NOT add ONE more Angel Moms to the list. Oh by the way people are numb to Dems name calling now.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Chris Jordan G you are a child,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

Kershner Timothy my account note fake 😂😂😂😂,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
LOOK At these idiots PICK UP A REPORT AND READ IDIOTS, THE WALL WILL DO NOTHING TO FIX THE PROBLEM...,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!
Gina Mcknight every major act of terrorism came from the sky.   Maybe we should build a roof,38 er cent approval rating.
Julie Albers Hampe I guess if you like drug traffickers, child trafficking, and gun smuggling then that’s up to you.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Joseph Nowik all presidents have called national emergencies.  I can’t wait until people know what they are talking about before spouting off.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Ed Kramer They have no idea how Trump is destroying America,  they are waiting for some talking head to feed them the line.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
John Wheeler But trying to reopen the Government is,  but looks to be an impossible task with half of the lawmakers refusing to talk and as usual showing that the American people are not their main concern,  they say how bad they feel for all those people who , and with the next breath they show them that they still care more about those new voters that they need to get into the Country. In the end those eight hundred thousand furloughed workers their  families and friends will decide who to hold responsible for this shutdown. I doubt they are all sitting around the kitchen table cheering the fact the the Democrats refuse to even discuss any kind of compromise,  they can plainly see that the President is trying, can’t imagine that they are sending messages to Pelosi letting her know that it’s ok hold your ground, it’s ok the kids ate yesterday, they will make it for a couple of more days, the electric company probably won’t turn off the power during the coldest weather we have had so far,  our neighborhood brought a couple of gallons of gas for the car just Incase we have an emergency. So yes Nancy stay strong take care of your special projects , get your votes , the American people are have had years of The Democrats putting them last so carry on.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Hilary Seymour,  I am so sorry for what you went through..  God Bless You and Give You Peace!!,I was working for an employer who had hired illegal immigrants and didn't notify the staff that had been working there. One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place.  Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.  I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR.  This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse  since then with the population of illegals.  Let's protect our future!

Roy Meston do have you thought that thru do you think that the businesses are going to loose money every thing WILL go cost of living will go up which will still put the ones that it is design to help in the same place that their in now it will put them in different tax bracket which means more taxes paid. I know because I'm one of the ones mostly have worked for minimum wages for 40 years when min wages were 4.30 hr to current of 12.00 the sad thing is by the time taxes are taken I still make about the same as I did some 40 years ago may 20 dollars more a week due to taxes that is a way to get more taxes,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Maybe,you should do some type of executive order and stop this type of child abuse and nonsense ongoing in this country, Some of this is involved in immigration practices so men are able to come to this country and become legal citizens.,1/11/2019 Federal gov’t is encouraging child marriage Posted January 11, 2019	by Fraidy Reiss  Can you guess the minimum age for someone in the U.S. to petition for a foreign spouse or fiancé(e)? Or for someone to be brought to the U.S. on a spousal or fiancé(e) visa?  It’s zero. The federal government does not specify any minimum age for such petitions.  As a result, we at Unchained have seen girls under 18 forced to marry just so their overseas “husbands” can get U.S. visas. We also have seen girls brought to the U.S., legally, as child brides. Either way, the girls typically are raped and beaten within their “marriage” and not allowed to finish their education. All with the federal government’s approval.  Thanks to the AHA Foundation, which flagged this dangerous loophole and demanded data on the number of children impacted, we now know that between 2007 and 2017, more than 8,600 approved spousal/fiancé(e) visa petitions involved a child. In 95 percent of those cases, the child was a girl.  We at Unchained lead the growing national movement to end child marriage in the U.S. Along with the National Coalition to End Child Marriage that we co-convened with Equality Now, we will continue to push for a minimum marriage age of 18 in every U.S. state and at the federal level. Please continue to support us as we do so.

Luis  López Good luck with that! Smh,American people will receive a smaller refund this year after filing their income tax returns. The Republican/Trump tax cuts is a big scam that only benefits the rich. That's all Paul Ryan wanted; he got it and ran away.    “Lower tax refunds might hurt the economy. If Americans are getting less money back, that might mean they're going to spend less of their refund.” - Jordan Valinsky  Your (small) refunds will be delayed thanks to President Donald Trump’s shutdown.  "I DIDN’T NEED TO DO THIS." - Donald Trump as he declares a national emergency taking billions of dollars away from our Veterans, and leaving for Florida for the weekend to PLAY GOLF.  “Trump biographer Craig Unger detailed Saturday morning the links between the president’s ties to the Russian mob and the silence of his former campaign manager Paul Manafort. Unger, author of House of Trump, House of Putin, explained on MSNBC’s AM Joy that unlike the Italian mafia, Russia mobsters report to Vladimir Putin — essentially making them “state actors” for the Kremlin. “I found 13 people who have had been in Trump Tower, associated with the Russian mafia,” the author explained, adding that the organized criminals “on and off for 35 years” used the president’s flagship Manhattan building “as a base of operations.” When Donald Trump “over expanded” in Atlantic City and went bankrupt to the tune of $4 billion, “Russian money played a huge, huge role” in his financial bounce-back.” – Noor Al-Sibai  JOIN THE GENERAL STRIKE APRIL 15, 2019.

Sherry Shahbazi Washington Post?? Hahahaha!,The truth hurts. Regardless of the source. Clearly the state propaganda faux news channel wouldn't report  this. 🤣
Love the phrase protect, defend not ignore and let in.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
I agree, ignore piglosi go after the other dems.,Republican Congressmen and Republican Senators, all Republicans, need to forget Nancy and hound all the other democratic Congressmen and Senators.  Work on them and they'll do something about Nancy Pelosi.  Pelosi needs to be reminded of who it is she works for and that she is NOT the president....not even close.
Do you think Ameticans don't do home invasions?,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Ron Wissler As vets go homeless, children are hungry, the seniors go without.  There is a special place in hell for you bigoted republicans.,You promised Mexico would pay for it.  Liar!
Charles Landry I don't see any problems being fixed. Bridges clean water sensible gun laws. Seeking asylum is legal. Most are running from violence on their own country..,What about the people killed my homegrown terrorists in America. There's more murders committed by them
Florence Lake you can say that again.... I do hate him.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Joshua de Perrodil and just what was that???,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin troll,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin  ok I will bite; LIES, FARCE, CENTRAL FAKE NEWS AGENCY, explain.
OK Stop sending 39 billion dollars to EU!!! I second that for any reason!!! You By Wall!! We Stop Payment to EU,Mexico,Guetamala,ElSalvador,Venezuela,Haiti,Africa,And Everybody!!! Great!!!,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Michael Petruzzi - your point being?????   You don't hear of women, gays or transgenders committing mass shootings do you??,How many people have been killed by white males in our country?????
Daniel Winget Yeah Right, you need another drink...since Lincoln? REALLY??? You clueless schmuck.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Leesa Parish Not Trump???? “I’ll be proud to shutdown the government to get border security, Chuck” Trump’s words to Chuck Schumer in the Oval right before he shutdown the Government and put 800,000 government workers out of work for the sake of his stupid wall. So don’t tell me this is a Dem thing. I never should’ve voted for this asshole, he wasn’t my choice, it was just a lack of options.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Bette Ford Why is anyone giving this whacko a voice anyway? She doesn’t even live in this country.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Michèle Biwer-Erpelding Who the hell are YOU to know what God is or isn’t amused by? You also don’t have the right to determine who is or isn’t a Christian. So shut your pie hole!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Vickie Jarrett Cartledge I changed my sentence above from "crazed base" to "short-sighted" base. I was addressing his crazed base, the ones that "ignore" the fact Trump said multiple times that Mexico "will pay" for the border wall. He ran for President on that platform. I will wait for the President of Mexico to say they will pay for the wall. Now, as for as not nice to mention Trumps "crazed base", its interesting his base is OK with his life-long disgusting or "unflattering" comments and actions, many of those targeting women. We deserve better.,For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.
Vickie Jarrett Cartledge I repeated  your word “short-sighted” to only make you happy. No other reason….I also used “unflattering”, thinking that would be nice too. OK, so much for that. What Bill Clinton did while President has no reflection or parallel with the distress Trump has brought to our country as President of the US and “leader of the free world“.  (Btw, I never voted for Bill Clinton and I’m still a registered Republican, which means nothing.) I vote and support who I think would make the best leader for our country.  Vickie, our allies don’t trust us anymore, that’s not leadership. Trump has eroded years of world goodwill and respect. Trump can’t manage his own administration. Four military Generals have left either by disgrace or opposition to Trumps erratic behavior and seat of the pants decisions. He flames the fire of division across our nation and the free world. He manages like a failed casino mobster. He’s a billionaire that’s filed bankruptcy 4 times, treats women and speaks of them and his sexual conquest like an immature 18 year old. Some of this and more “before” anyone had the opportunity to vote for him.  Demos want border control that represent the values that most of us know and respect. Values that made our county the most admired in the world. Not a wall (I can add some adjectives but I‘ll be nice).  Yes, I agree that Trump never said he would negotiate with Mexico to build the wall. Trump said repeatedly that Mexico “will” pay for the wall. The guarantee that millions bought into and voted for him. Of course, three million more voters “did not” buy into his ridiculous promise.  On Feb. 16, 2016 then Mexican president Vicente Fox, flatly stated that Mexico will not pay for Trumps wall. I believed the former Mexican leader and still do.  The manufactured wall issue, which Trump “waited” to rally his base, is nothing more but another diversion from the Mueller investigation, which so far has placed a wall around some pretty bad hombres. And Flint still doesn’t have clean water.,For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.
Frank Betty Page The democrats have always been screwed up even back in the 1800s,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Kelly Cross Trump is the best thing to happen to America since Ronald Reagan. President Trump has NO ties to the KKK and NAZIS,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP

Buck Strunk Dude, if your meaning is "walled border", you have your list inverted...  About 32 out of 195 countries have walled borders...,No other country has open borders why should we
Trump can end this shutdown with a stroke of a pen. Call or Write the White House and tell them to end the shutdown: The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20500 https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/write-or-call/ PHONE NUMBERS Comments: 202-456-1111 Switchboard: 202-456-1414 TTY/TTD Comments: 202-456-6213 Visitor’s Office: 202-456-2121,I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can’t fool everyone. Open the government !
Timothy Betts Thanks for your comment. You must hate humanity if you think what I spouted off is a good thing, or best for America. Trumps shut down of the government is something we are ALL going to pay for. I agree to disagree with your comments.,Day 27 of the tRump government shutdown. Trump has a tendency to propose wild ideas out loud and then repeat them before coming to his senses or getting talked off the ledge. An off-the-top-of-our head list: Leaving NATO. Bombing Iran. Death penalty for drug dealers. Birthright citizenship. Firing staff. Firing Mueller. Leaving the World Trade Organization. Blowing up Iranian fast boats in the Persian Gulf. Withdrawing troops and families from South Korea. Nationalizing a 5G network. Withdrawing from Syria, (just to name a few) you saw what happened yesterday. According to the Washington Post President Trump has made 6,420 false or misleading claims. That’s the President of the U.S. Let me say that AGAIN “That’s the President of the UNITED STATES” We’re living in the shameless society, where accountability and apology are just white flags for the weak.
Nick Baker quit listening to that fake news that CNN and MSN spew out . We the people elected Mr. Trump to build that wall. We the people want that wall for our safety , well being and the sake of our children.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Bruce Hale show us one Democrat that supports ISIS, or MS13, or illegal immigration. You plainly show your bias and hatred for those that are working to oppose Donald Trump, but show no compassion for those that Trump's government shutdown impacts more severely each day. How would you feel if you were forced to work unpaid for a month just so Donald Trump has a hostage to bargain with for his wall. You support a dealmaker who cares little for 800,000 civil servants and thousands of others who are working longer hours to keep things running without them. No true American or Christian could act so cruelly.,Build that wall & stand strong against the democrats who support ISIS, MS13, criminal aliens, 6 more years of the best president ever. Chuckie Nancy Maxine Waters Pocahontas & that evil stupid Cortez lady you will lose & you all can go to hell
Buck Strunk no other country has a wall around it. Canada, Russia, China, Brazil none has a border wall.,No other country has open borders why should we
Dave Boyer this is not a dictatorship. Trump cannot build his wall by the issuance of an executive order. He cannot raise or lower taxes. He cannot write laws. Congress under Republican control passed what he wanted for a tax cut. But even McConnell and Ryan did not get him his wall. They had the power, but did not. Because they did not want the wall.  Only Trump wants a wall, with his name on it. And he will starve good government employees and the country's poor retirees to get his way. How can you support that?,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Debbie Skinner your profile looks like Putins people created it. No facts on where you are from, work, or live. So dont be so quick to label those with opposing views as not being real. I worked for 51 years, paid my taxes and SS. Raised my kids to all work and pay taxes. I oppose the wall, support border security, am for more accessible ports of entry and better screening,  and am torally against the gov't shutdown. I blame Donald Trump for creating it, and Mitch McConnell for prolonging it by not allowing bipartisan legislation that has passed the house to even be put up for debate and a possible vote. He is now the biggest obstacle to reopening the government, not Shumer, not Pelosi.,Man you fake trolls are out there in full force but you are not the voice of the people, you are scum cowards hiding behind phony accounts! How’s the weather in Russia or is it China or in your Mom’s basement? Build the wall! BTW, your irreverent comments just unifies us even more and makes us stronger so knock yourselves out!
Judy Goebel you are thanking a man who stopped the pay and pay for 800,000 government employees and forces thousands of critical air traffic controllers to work unpaid. How do you sleep at night condoning such self centered evil?,Amen! Thank you for all you do.  Hang in there. We are counting on you.
Mark van Beek Just Trump imitating one of his Russian heroes.,You get it, walls don't work anyway.
Kristy Rodencal Goettl my vote counts, too. Build the wall.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Katy Chavez one by one just like hunting, everyone has to sleep sometime.,I know if my daughter was murdered by an illegal,  though I would probably  end up in hell I would have to seek vigilante revenge..
Benji Smith illegal immigrants is illegal already,  the name Ann is not, the name Ann ,is not costing The USA, billion each year, illegal immigrants are.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
I just reread your post ,dont really know what you are getting at.so if I offered you sorry.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do.

Do you mean speaking truth?,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive.

David Monson 90 percent of drugs coming in from Mexico.,Drugs are a choice that unfortunately many teens make...Innocent teens getting shot and killed in school is not a choice......Where is the national emergency?

If it was your family member that died, you may feel differently about it.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Lisa Mannim retired from the Michigan department of corrections,  if done right ,the wall /fences ,would stop about 99% .I was in Israel before the wall was built, they had weekly bus bombings, after wall built bus bombings stopped,  then they built a wall ,along Egyptian border, where thousands were entering illegally, know there was only 16 people get across, wall work if built right, and manned right. Thank you.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Tammy Zaluzney I was in Israel before they built the walls, almost weekly bus bombings, after wall built bus bombings stopped,  Israel boarder with Egypt, has thousands crossing, wall built 16 is all that got in , if built right walls and fences, work ,I'm retired from the Michigan department of corrections,  I know a little about the suspect.,No they don't.  Ask the ancient Chinese.  Ask Berlin.  Ask Rome.  They all fail in the end.  This would fail immediate, as the issue in not at the border and you know it.  Stop lying to people.  You have no intention of building a wall.  You're just trying to save face while distracting from the hits the economy keep taking, the deficit blow up, and the Russia collusion case.  No one with a shred of sense believes you Donny.  #TraitorTrump #NationalDisgrace
you dont live near the boarder,, where these fucking illegals , steel anything they can get their hands on..break into your house..or your car,cause damage to the towns near by..and the insurance companies keep raising their rates for every claim you make...just to mention the little things they do,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Maths?,Every day illegals are arrested in Atlanta for stealing, selling drugs or I think you knew I meant meth, I guess I am not perfect. Suffered stroke and brain and fingers are’t together working.
Yeah and vote out the people that been running your city for years,Why isn’t mexico paying for it? 😂😂😂 damn y’all dumb 😂😂
John Scott No one cares what you think! We we are laughing at you for rigging everything for Hillary and she still got crushed. So shut up and get back to your safe space moron. Bite me!,John Scott No one cares what you think! We we are laughing at you for rigging everything for Hillary and she still got crushed. So shut up and get back to your safe space moron. Bite me!
Only a moron would believe Mexico would pay for a wall. But then again, if you think Trump is good for America, describing you as a moron is far too kind ;),Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Another fake account set up by the Kremlin!,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Which god are you thanking???,God Bless you President Trump! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
Fake account. Rusdian bot!,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
Throw........ MS. Nope already got trump getting dump over the wall and let the Spanish and cartel take care of him. Then.... Tear the wall down,BUILD THAT WALL then throw  all the democrats over it !
Sandy Theriault , lol building a wall to protect US citizens doesn't violate our rights. Do you really think people will just do nothing if they try to take away our right to bear arms. There wil be civil war if that happens. And I'm guessing the side with weapons will probably win.,Sandy hook, San Bernardino, Parkland and just yesterday in Illinois?? So lets now focus on gun control!! Thank #45 for opening up national emergency - trump did set a precedent, there can now be real gun control via national emergency new guidelines just set!! Protection for all!!
John Robert Troll,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Vicki Zamow Troll,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.

Frank Eie this guy is the worst! I pray we don’t have another 4 years of this bs.,Joni Preuss No, that was certainly an unfulfilled campaign promise.  "we are going to build a wall...and who is going to pay for it". then you replied...Mexico is going to pay for it!  Come on...you remember!

Ahmad Mahmoud and you hide your head in a rag and cover your ugly women with body rags. Get on your camel goat fucker and leave,You’re the ugliest president ever
Can use my tax money to help build a wall,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.

I guess you didn't see the latest in the senate, as they tried to block a removal of sanctions against a Russian Oligarch. Or his comment, that Russia was justified in the invasion of Afghanistan, or his taking and hiding the translator notes from his talks with Putin, or....etc etc. Your description of mainstream media as garbage indicates you, yourself, have a raging case of Coprophagia. Wise up, Mr. Green. The hour is late.,Wish you'd spend as much time defending us as you do Russia.
Your felon in chief will face serious charges, as have his cohort. Mueller is careful and thorough, and we shall see what he has when he is ready. There is proof. The investigators are not partisan. My 'side' is the one using the constitution, seeking truth, and considering everything. Your invective is not persuasive, and would be an embarrassment to you, if you were capable of being embarrassed.,Wish you'd spend as much time defending us as you do Russia.
RIP GOP,Dumb!
Timothy Norton justvwanted tonsee who would laugh and be angry over defending our country.,Every go through the emojis and look at the few laugh and andrybfaces and realize they are all foreigners lmao
i said this once-twice before, shoild be publicized WHY we basically do not hear much about thois crap onnour northern borders.  i know some reasons why, maybe a klist at of top reasons wouldenlighten some people that our so border does not have to be this way.  🇺🇸,Rod Novoa your a CNN washed ANTI AMERICAN fool that trolls all darkness!
i think it shoild be publicized in any venue that people know how drugs, guns, illegals, children are smuggled in to the USA.  might be enlightening as alot of people (if they 1st believe theres at so border problem) might thinkg alot of this stuff comes across in a standup, oiutmfront, inyour face manner, THINK AGAIN=these coyotes or whatever are real resource full.  USA.   🇺🇸,Rod Novoa your a CNN washed ANTI AMERICAN fool that trolls all darkness!
Veronica Torres hahahahahahaha,I notice everyone who says a wall is useless, senseless or stupid has walls in their homes. Some even have giant walls or fences around their perimeters.
Neither do we. Have you seen how many trillions of dollars of debt these drunken sailors have run up?,Edward Odine well we’ll

AW Sylwester The answers are YES.  Free elections?  Really?  You REALLY went there?  YOU are as ignorant as they come.  Go drink more of the Hillary Obama Koolaide !!!!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Stan Piznarski Maybe the President with the help of Congress can designate an easement of the much of the border as one long protected National Park or Monument and then legally use funds to protect the vegetation of the parks with a wall, due to ecological impacts from Illegal immigrants destroying the protected lands. An existing example of something similar to this would be the Roosevelt Reservation.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
And some chick climbed over that wall too.,I agree with you, terry, the rich people only out for, themselves
The trump party is the party of ignorant lemmings.,The other party is the party of Benghazi and they have a similar policy for America.  Lets roll! SHUT THEM DOWN and send our people the support they request before they're overrun.
You don’t need to apologize to trump supporters; they’re idiots, they don’t know any difference.,What are you waiting for? Who's running this country? You have the power to protect this country, without the approval of the Democrats. DECLARE AN EMERGENCY! GET THE JOB DONE!
And you idiots call yourselves patriotic Americans who want to rid America of its actual institutions of democracy.,Tell Mitch to change the rules to cut off debate!
Is that what smoke trump is blowing up his supporters asses now?,With all the amounts I’ve seen of her spending tax dollars on alcohol, I would say she’s a full blown alcoholic and needs to go! She can’t even speak!
You elected him because you’re idiots.,Build the damn wall President! This is why we elected you!
Jerry Matthews Smith working backwards isn’t an accomplishment.,You are one in million and million in one. Love you Trump ❤❤
Trump isn’t s leader at all. Let alone a global leader.,You are one in million and million in one. Love you Trump ❤❤
Put some arsenic in your kool aid Paul.,Then do the national emergency an quit screwing around with these communist
Andrew Vincent,   1) either be proactive or reactive about immigration. Your entire foundation is reactive because it doesn’t come with a better plan   2) meet halfway? You mean by Pelosi and Schumer saying no wall is meeting halfway?   3) I put Mexico paying for the wall in the same bucket with shovel ready jobs and affordable healthcare. Mine is now $1,440 per month and I have bern taking it on the chin for years. Some ideas just can’t be fulfilled! Let’s not act like politicians haven’t failed us in the past!,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andrew Vincent, last century? Unless you also live in a last century house, technology has improved all we build, even using sensors to help see tunnels and other things. To use a medieval analogy isn’t being very truthful   But how do you process people legally if they can walk in undetected nearly everywhere? Plus how do you guarantee work for amounts of immigrants you can’t control their entry?,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andrew Vincent, no one said there was one solution to fix illegal immigration. But the wall will be a beginning.   While it’s not your job to be proactive, it is the job of Americans to evaluate what solutions our representatives come up with to see if it is feasible and makes sense. Isn’t it how we evaluate coworkers and even family members, to say nothing of ourselves?   Pelosi said on tape she will oppose Trump’s wall. Now she did use some nebulous references about some kind of barrier in certain places. But in February 2018, wasn’t it Pelosi who said we should cut the grass instead?   You want to talk about a sales pitch? You mean like passing the ACA even without fully reading it? Are you serious?,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andrew Vincent, ok, let’s examine all you said...  1) by not having a better solution other than a wall, you’d rather take a pragmatic approach and do nothing. This means illegal immigration, which costs anywhere between 54-125 billion annually not only continues, but grows in expense. Do you think such a response will increase, decrease, or have no affect on 22 trillion in debt?   2) what does “enhanced border security” mean? Democrats can’t even come up with a number of how many agents would be required, much less generate an annual expense.   3) I’d rather spend 30 billion today on a wall, about 10% of the interest alone on our debt (that no American benefits from) to possibly curb the obvious increase in illegal immigration costs. Then if years later, some resident genius comes up with a better solution, then let’s go for it!,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andrew Vincent, then what you are saying is you aren’t interested in Pelosi or Schumer taking some of the 54 billion in discretionary spending available to fix the water issues in flint? If not, what would you like them to do with the money?,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andrew Vincent, yes and 5.7 billion is only 1/60th of the annual interest of 22 trillion in debt,$5B wall < $25 ladder
Andy Jenkinson, then couldn’t those same electronics be used in concert with a wall to stop those from entering illegally? Remember there is more than one problem, which then require more than one solution,5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
Andy Jenkinson, then if drug barons will use micro lights to fly over the border, then your solution to add more agents wouldn’t solve the problem either, would it?,5.7 billion dollars for 200 miles of fence is over 16,000 dollars per YARD!
Christina Maschmeyer, I wouldn’t say there is that type of disparity, but due to the Trump supporters who remain silent each and every week, I’d think it could be mote around the 2-4% range.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down.

Jeramy Felton Hargis, why is it anti Trump people can’t even see the noses on their own faces? You have this idea a wall is only a physical structure, but with seismic instruments, drones, and other technologies, it becomes a smart wall. Of course there are still other areas to address, but a wall is a good beginning   As far as homeless and flint goes, doesn’t Pelosi have 54 billion in discretionary expenses? Why not send some of that money to those concerns?  Also, Trump is asking for about 1/60th of the annual interest that accrued on 22 trillion in debt.   Talk about anti Trump people not having even the insight God bestowed on even a pet hamster.,No other country has open borders why should we
Raul Andres Gonzalez Sr., excuse me??? No other country can demand who we let in or whether that decision is cost prohibitive. We have the final say, not the rest of the world.,No other country has open borders why should we

Carsten Adsersen, 5.7 billion from Pelosi and Schumer take care of that!

But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen’s testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions “internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents”) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family — specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. — knew the details of Cohen’s secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as “deep involvement” in the discussions with Russia — a subject they’ve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had “extensive discussions” with the family members. The outlet’s two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them “very detailed updates.” If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump’s firm support in the Senate — which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House — dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President’s immediate concern is Mueller.

Don’t forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex–campaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President’s power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer — and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?

It's Time for Trump to Think About His Children and Do the Same  Impeachment should be far from the President's only concern By Martin London (VP Spiro T Agnew’s attorney, back in the day)  The BuzzFeed report that former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has told investigators that, after the election, President Trump instructed him to lie to Congress has raised new calls for impeachment. But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen’s testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions “internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents”) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family — specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. — knew the details of Cohen’s secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as “deep involvement” in the discussions with Russia — a subject they’ve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had “extensive discussions” with the family members. The outlet’s two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them “very detailed updates.” If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump’s firm support in the Senate — which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House — dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President’s immediate concern is Mueller. This is not like Trump firing of then–FBI Director James Comey, which lawyers can challenge because it was technically within the President’s constitutional power to do so for any reason, good or bad. This is conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony. There can be no argument that the President has the Constitutional authority to conspire to, say, cause somebody to rob a bank — or commit any other felony, such as giving perjurious testimony concerning the President’s conduct.  Don’t forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex–campaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President’s power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer — and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?  At some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment. The longer the President waits, the more evidence piles up, and the tougher it will be to get a deal. Mueller already has a federal grand jury hearing evidence that just received a six-month extension. The President should make his deal before that body completes its work. The Mueller report may accompany a clutch of Mueller indictments.
Patrick Sciarratta, you indicated Trump is seeing a 7 point drop in about 45 or so days, which is a very misleading statistic. Polling is best extrapolated over long periods of time to obtain a true representative sample of enough data.   In December 2017, Trump had an average approval rating of 37% and it slowly increased to a high of about 43.3 in about April 2018 or so. Since that high, Trump has been his numbers fluctuate between a low of 41% to a high of nearly 44%. Statistically speaking, since the shutdown was imminent, Trump has lost about 1.3% to date   However, congress as a whole has taken a hit as well. They had an average between 19.8% to a high of about 20.7 in the same 6 - 8 month time frame as Trump. Today their approval is at 19.3, or about a loss of around 0.6 - 0.8%, or about half of Trump’s loss   But the shutdown doesn’t affect Trump nearly as bad as if he capitulated to Pelosi and Schumer. For if he did, he would lose many of his base sooner. Therefore he would have lost followers regardless. But as long as voters are lowering congress as well, at least he isn’t the only one taking a hit.,Serious, Real News: My Client Resigned From the White House.

Paul Chiplock, let me ask you a question about this immigration on the border being at a decline. If immigrants are crossing into America undetected in the first place, then living here under the radar, how can they be calculated? Therefore by what logic can a decline narrative be created and be even somewhat accurate?,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don’t want this wall.
Paul Chiplock, that’s the point! How can any entity create a statistic when the premise itself means one would have to include immigrants that came in undetected? How do you account for someone in a statistical way you never saw or otherwise discovered after the fact?   Why do you think there is such a big range in calculating the overall cost of illegal immigration? It’s from a low of 54 billion to a high of almost 175 billion. That’s because no one really knows! All of it are estimates based upon supposition without facts. It’s based on an estimate of 14 million, but if they are in hiding, how does one really know?,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don’t want this wall.
Paul Chiplock, then why do some portions of a wall exist today? That means it had to be an issue before? Why not today?,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don’t want this wall.
Peter Darling, way too funny! Dwindling base??? Actually, according to RCP, Trump’s average approval is only 1% below his highest. See below for the truth   Poll	Date	Approve	Disapprove	Spread RCP Average	1/25 - 2/14	43.6	53.6	-10.0  Rasmussen	2/12 - 2/14	50	49	+1 FOX News	2/10 - 2/12	46	52	-6 Economist	2/10 - 2/12	41	57	-16 Reuters	2/6 - 2/12	39	57	-18 Politico	2/7 - 2/10	45	51	-6 The Hill	2/7 - 2/8	47	53	-6 Gallup	2/1 - 2/10	44	52	-8 CNN	1/30 - 2/2	42	54	-12 Quinnipiac	1/25 - 1/28	38	57	-19 All President Trump Job Approval Polling Data  As far as Manafort goes, all this narrative about someone who was sent to prison over something that wasn’t even a part of the 2016 campaign. Amazing!,The wall is just a distraction for Drumpf’s dwindling base. Drumpf’s 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort, attended a pre-sentencing hearing for his crimes this week. The recommendation was for him to serve between 19-24 years. His sentence was increased due to his continued lying about the contacts between the Russian government officials and his campaign team. Why would the 69 year old continue to lie and inevitably choose to die in prison? Keeping his boss out of it and hoping for a presidential pardon perhaps. I don’t know but Special Counsel Robert Mueller does. 😏
Philip Mueller, why don’t walls work? If they don’t work, why do we see so many all over America?,Walls are stupid, they dont work. Almost all crime is committed by American citizens. How about gun control if you care about our family? What's that? You cant hear me over the sound of counting the 30 million dollars NRA gave you?
Robin Barnhill, Democrats would screw up a wet dream if they understood what one was,Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Robin Barnhill, I agree! Schumer is a liar and would never want to be accountable for his inaction and deceitfulness,Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Robin Barnhill, actually, I’m totally fine keeping the government shut down indefinitely,Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Robin Barnhill, but since you say Trump can’t be trusted, then you accept you couldn’t trust him to reopen the government either? That means you also accept a very long government shutdown,Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Robin Barnhill, no matter what you say, even omitting such a comment doesn’t get the government reopened. Isn’t that what you are upset about?,Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Shawn Timmons, are you kidding? We have congress with a 19.3% average approval rating while Trump is at 41.4%. But then it’s Trump who is unfit? Who is unfit are the myriad of insincere politicians who take great care when they talk by not really trying to say anything in the process,Bob Segal
Shawn Timmons, that’s fine! Then don’t bitch about the shutdown. Trump can wait, and wait, and wait.....,Bob Segal
Shawn Timmons, why don’t walls work? We already know why so many liberals don’t work.,Bob Segal
Tony Sherrard, we will leave that to the democrats,Bob Segal Democrats read books - you should try it sometime.
I am not sure I am following your thought here..."39000 killed by American Citizens" OK and? We should ignore any addition from illegals because...?,39000 killed by US citizens with guns
Scared of...? YES!! Armed Demoncrat THUGS. We ARE working on that...,Donald Trump just needs to take a trip to Chicago  “ oh wait I forgot, he’s too scared” 😂😂😂
Question: Which Party Platform is egotistical and which is Altruistic in nature? Politics are very simple to understand. There is a balance in between "The needs of the many out-way the needs of a few" AND "A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link" If we find the sweet spot in those two things we will live in heaven on earth. President Trump is thee closest we have come to this line of thinking in our history as a country.,Tony Perez, we've got our fair share too.
William Bush wtf,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
What comes through the legal entrances can be controled and tracked because they have security.  Things that come through an unsecure border can not.,You better worry what's coming through our airports and ports of entry
Go back to history class.  The Berline wall divided a country that did not want to be divided.  Our American wall will divide two different countries that want to be divided.  See the difference or are you still blind with hate.,build the wall, it worked great in Berlin
Study the life of Christ and then think about what you just said.,Bobb Marly my brother these are the days of coming of Christ i meant it in a way where as life isnt meant to be thiz way God bless you. I walk with Christ
wow man go back to history class.  The Berline wall divided a country and neither side wanted to be divided.  Our American wall will divide two seperate coutnries who want to be seperate countries.,Bobb Marly the point was, did the wall solve any problems, and if so, why does it not exist today?
Albert Kojo Kyekye Amen,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Jill Nawrocki Dienes drugs get in them too... Prisons are for criminals whom has actually committed a crime.,If walls dont work, why do prisons have them and not drones? So dumb!!!

STEP #4 SAY NOTHING MORE THAN THAT IF YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS AND WALK OUT! STEP #5 24HRS LATER DECLARE EMERGENCY AND FUND WALL. END SHUT DOWN TAKE CREDIT. STEP #6 CALL ROUND TABLE GET PIZZA N ROOTBEER FOR YOU AND BARRON!,STEP #1) CALL NEWS "BRIEF" STEP #2) HOLD PEN AND PAPER UP STEP #3) TELL NANCY PELOSI DEMS CAN STOP THE SHUT DOWN RIGHT NOW, BY FUNDING THE WALL. DEMS ARE WORKING TO PROTECT THE USA OR THEY ARENT. YOU HAVE 24 HRS TO PROTECT OUR NATION BEFORE I DO!
Stephen Pierson thanks for upholding the very low standard of discourse you Leftists are noted for. P.S. I noted you have no photos on your page. Why not ? 😉,If we don't defeat Pelosi we cease to be relevant.

Kenneth McIntyre you r such a clueless idiot,Remember Obamacare repeal? Republican House and Senate, Republican president, and Donald whiffed, twice. As I said, the Democrats are not the reason he constantly fails.
Stan Piznarski  Amen bro🇺🇸,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Bobby Wilson seems to me, the democrats won't meet with our president and negotiate...dude, call Nancy and Chuck.,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
BUILD THE DAMN WALL,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Bill Klein So can the idiots who are blocking what we want...you might take notice that this country voted Donald Trump into office..whether, or not, you want to believe it...it's true. We voted him into office because of the platform he ran on.  I can't imagine what kind of trouble this country would be in if the big cities made all of our decisions.  Thank God for the electoral college.,I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.

Term limits for everyone in Washington, not just our presidents.,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them.

WHAT A F——D up way to live!!!
He drove they let him across. The border patrol is part of the problem wall won’t work Military,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL

Tell that to Pelosi and  Schumer.,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Danny Jones Thank you for the kind thought.  This American really understands your anguish. It seems our culture is also being destroyed. Our President is trying with all his might to stop that from taking place.  I sincerely hope brexit goes though for the UK and that “WE” get  our border wall.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
How do we tell you to get lost look at our country and the people who can’t afford to feed their children and pay their mortgage but yet that’s ok according to the Democratic Party because it was one of them that ordered that into law fuckin Obama care nothing the Democratic Party has done has benefited the American people why didn’t they impeach Clinton because oh I forgot he was a democrat but yet they want to impeach trump last time I checked he hadn’t shooved a cigar up any young interns vagina and said he didnt do it when he did like Clinton the Democratic Party has embarrrassed this country to the fullest and no one likes any of them. And they need to go al they do is rob and steal the American people blind,How do we tell Nancy and Shurmer we want them to resign I think that should be a petition all Americans should be able to sign also because every where I go it's all I hear people saying they.  Want these two idiots out
I assume you & those who share your feelings are opening your homes to a dozen "refugees" each.  YOU get to pay their bills - food, clothes, medicine, job training, cell phones, cars - whatever they want.  Let me know how that works out.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Max, you need to study up on the differences among socialism, capitalism, fascism & communism.  I recommend Ebenstein's book on the four isms.  First published in 1963.  Check Amazon.  The wall has nothing to do with socialism!,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Mark van Beek , why do wealthy politicans and movie stars have walls and gates surrounding their homes.,You're gonna feel betrayed when it's YOUR turn in the GULAG!
Abby Schmidt they are indirectly through tariffs.,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Adam Ben Mexico will pay, think about it. ..its gonna cost them when that wall goes up....,Americans says no more lies, you said Mexico will pay for, so!!!
MD K Landry , is that the only word u know? education  did u wrong....hahaha,Trumptards

Johntavious Williams well it wasn't! So why create a fake narrative! Troll!,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Larry read the part where those seeking asylum are legally allowed to enter the US. That’s how America works.,Can’t wait till your found guilty of Treason. Then all this goes back to the way it was as your regime is quickly dismantled. #WallsAreForWussies
And we don't so you don't have a point.,No other country has open borders why should we
Glen Butler meth dealer Gus,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Charlie Daboub  it could have if those Rinos such as,mccain werent such con artists,Don’t give in Mr President
Paul Burton  whats on your DD214?,Don’t give in Mr President
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin You keep saying the same stupid crap. You keep calling Trump a liar.... Should we go back to all the lies Obummer fed us??? "If you like your plac you can keep it".... Funny how your party was all for a wall before........... You all just hate not being in power and getting to shove your ideology down our throats.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Jim LaMuth it’s Presidents’ Day weekend idiot. The real national emergency is that gay a*ss sweater your wearing,Declares a national emergency, also states it isn’t an emergency, “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.”  And goes to Mar-largo  I’m confused.   What is the emergency?  And how is your administration responding to it? By golfing?
You are aware that the Mayor of Flint took money given to her to fix the water and donated it to a super PAC right?,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that’s where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don’t see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That’s unacceptable.  Anyway, I’m done discussing it.  If 🇷🇺 doesn’t interfere,  😉 I’m sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
Ah, why is it that every time I discuss anything. Every right winger brings up "black on black crime in chicago". Do you even know the circumstances leading up to the massive crime in that area? Do you know the history? Because it starts with right wing policies. Since gun control measures in Chicage, crime has seen a steady decrease yearly. So we started there. What's your point? Is a wall going to keep you safe, definitely not. Not when the major terrorists in this nation are home-grown of the white right wing variety.,There are far more stories of white right wing men doing a mass shooting.
No they aren't Palo. Show me the data and I'll show you why you're wrong.,There are far more stories of white right wing men doing a mass shooting.
Brenda De Boer-Davidson literally the first President in my lifetime that has followed through on a majority of their campaign promises,Thank you for following through on your promises!
Trump OWNS the shutdown 👍 he said he would OWN it himself,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Move to the US brother. We need more people like you here.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Josh Gr Are you seriously such a sad person that you are still blaming Russia for that L in 2016! What a loser haha,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!
Jacquelyn Scherer how would you suggest securing the border? Honest question.,“Working together to secure the border” does NOT require a wall.  Get over yourself!
What about overpopulation and the population of foster/adoption facilities/systems? What about the Christians that are pro-life until the child is born then turn their nose up at it and tout "It's your responsibility." Etc.,How many children have been killed by Americans?
Fact: No Republican has EVER had an abortion.,How many children have been killed by Americans?
Dan Burnzinsky Thought them over it! Mind bullets!,BUILD THAT WALL then throw  all the democrats over it !
Mexico doesn't border our west coast. The Pacific ocean does.,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
dEmOCrAt CoMMuNisTs!@?#!?,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
A wall won't bring your relative back. It will just waste your tax dollars.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!

No I’m not for or against especially to protect crooked politicians , but what I am against is falsely claiming your patriotism is the reason you’re doing something when that billions of dollars of money could go to things that would immediately effect Americans daily life’s, and then to top it off thousands of people are being effected by something they can’t even control and may bit wvwn belive in all due to one mans agenda, I cannot call that patriotic or love of a country.,And if you don’t look out for your citizens?? At what point does one outweigh another. You truly can’t say you care about America when there is so many people working for the government, your government, not getting paid....I mean come on
Elizabeth Burton Steere smart people don’t fight against their own argument. She has stated multiple times that we need border security. She fights it now because she doesn’t want trump to be the one to do so. She is a hypocrite. She could give to shits about your safety and the safety of this country.,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Kelly Cross if you only had any idea how many democrats are ashamed of their party and are voting republican now days.😂👍,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Ummm... You vote a President into office in hopes they'll fulfill the campaign promises you voted them in for. So yeah, he would have bragging rights, considering most other Presidents did nothing or screwed us over.,You noticed
Jim Butkowsky that’s just if if that illegal person had not been here her daughter would be alive. #buildthewall,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Albert Kojo Kyekye nigga quit actn like a coon..,Eric Wroblewski thank you
LaTonya Stewart Boss  Exactly!,I'm sad to hear this but American's do drugs\drink and then get behind the wheel and drive too. Remember Mother's Against Drunk Drivers?
Matt Martine but criminal's dont care about gun laws they go around them but all these gun laws hurt law abiding people guns dont kill people, people kill people.,Yet nothing about the 30,000 plus gun deaths caused by American citizens every year. 🤔
George Mendes erm,,, its spelt ' smocking' 😂,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Randy Johnson if you think Hillary Clinton should have won then your an idiot.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...

And stop sending our tax dollars to other countries.  We need it here now.  The cost of housing has caused people to have to live on the streets.,Our tax dollars go to fix infrastructure and walls in other countries, but not here in America.  Build the wall and fix our infrastructure.

Jesse McMurray , not if they come the right way, not by jumping my fence.,Jesse McMurray yes but they knocked first
David White Eagle I will agree but demon-craps does not want any media😝.  Remember when Schumer and Pelosi had their first meeting with President Trump.  They had cameras there and the demon-craps are just cautious about how stupid they really are.😝,Why not hold negotiations with dems on camera so all Americans can see how they are
Glenda Mitchell Stoddard AMEN.  Leave her over there and let some other countries to put up with her poop.,You should have never cancelled pelosis flight......you should have cancelled her return flight!!!!!!!

Sally Ward We stand with our President Donald Trump 🤗😊,JUST DO IT!
Schanel Farrelly  I am sure that President Trump knows the best route to take.  He has done it all of his life. #BuildThatWallPresidentTrump,Brenda Williams Dennis bankruptcy how many times??
Josh Gr no proof of collusion..... thank you, next!,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Greg Kemp how is it affecting the poor?,Not opposed to building the wall but part of your promise was that Mexico would pay for it. Who will pay for it?? Us the poor. And if this shutdown continues it only hurts the poor more and more. I'm on the fence with this since you Mr. President have changed your game and plans so many times.
We don't fund planned Parenthood?,Hyde Amendment.
Erik Biggs not a weak argument because, although I am glad your family now has healthcare hence why that topic is easy for you to brush off! Obamacare really fucked up the rest of healthcare for others including myself. The border needs secured for so many reasons Drugs,illegals,terrorists etc. And im sorry we need a wall because we just dont have enough manpower to constantly monitor it at all times.,You stated Mexico 🇲🇽 was gonna pay for the wall ?! Did you forget
Erik Biggs occupational risks! No different than Ford or Gm laying people off.weak argument,You stated Mexico 🇲🇽 was gonna pay for the wall ?! Did you forget

Lea Callahan god bless and grab em by the pussy,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
Colby Chavez  10. Reversing Obama’s Cuba policies: During the campaign, Trump promised to roll back the “concessions” his predecessor gave to Cuba.

Jacqueline George , I’m sure you are aware of our 60 Billion + dollar trade deficit with Mexico each year.  What if President Trump made an agreement with Mexico to lower tariffs for US goods shipped there? Saving America that 60 Billion? That’s taking 60 Billion a year, away from Mexico, and giving it back to America.   Well, he did sign an agreement with Mexico to do just that.

Jim MacKey 63 million people elected Trump. We ALL own this shutdown together with him. The same 63 million want the wall built. Most of us are not effected by the shut down.

Nope. That's just a nice convenient position that sound reasonable, but the hard truth and argument against that relaxed attitude is, that if that was the case, the wall could have been erected by now, based on an agreement made long ago. The socalled "gun" you so highly claim has in fact just been drawn recently.  It's a bit two-tongued...first denying making any agreement at all under any circumstances. Then denying making any agreement, because of "a gun" and claiming, that a deal could have been made if the "gun" hasn't been drawn.. Come on,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Have to start at the border,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.

,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Spoken like a good little socialist robot who hasn’t got a clue. There’s the door, Gary. No one will miss you.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston  Mexico stole the land from the Indians first then Texas kicked Mexico off the land . So technically we saved the Indians from Mexico. They were actually killing them saying they are nothing more than subhumans that need to be exterminated.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Sebastian Rodriguez  the swamp is the Government nonessential employees. They say since the lay off the government is actually working 10x better with on 15% workforce. I say we make the nonessential employees be permanently unemployed . They need to go get real jobs .,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
William Bush  actually it doesn’t. It only applies to citizens.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

I never said income taxes. I said taxes. Everything they buy here, they pay taxes on. Just like you or me.,We’ll gladly defend them. But we won’t pay $21 billion just to build the damn thing, plus billions per year in maintenance.   The answer is “No”.  Your popularity is dropping pretty quick. You might want to go ahead and accept defeat on this one. That’s what you get for trying to tack regulatory bills onto spending bills.  “No”. - Nancy Pelosi
Undocumented immigrants literally don’t qualify for federal aid. Period. They do, however, pay taxes that they never see a penny of.  They also have much lower crime statistics than any other group of American citizens.  Feel free to try and prove me wrong. I’ll wait.,We’ll gladly defend them. But we won’t pay $21 billion just to build the damn thing, plus billions per year in maintenance.   The answer is “No”.  Your popularity is dropping pretty quick.

That’s a dead link Cindy. Feel free to try again.,We’ll gladly defend them. But we won’t pay $21 billion just to build the damn thing, plus billions per year in maintenance.   The answer is “No”.

you're not wrong,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Stephen Pierson you should be tested for Rabies.,Donald Trump you will get the wall and a lot more.  And of course, Pelosi and Schumer will take credit for it.  Obama will say he orchestrated it back when he was just a freshman chimp.  But who cares, you're getting the wall.
Alejandro Sanchez  are you a illegal ?,Did you hear about Aurora illinois shooting yesterday asshole? Guess what, he was legal and with a felony and somehow he bought a gun.  How your stupid wall is going to solve that ?
How about stopping all the millions of innocent babies being killed through abortion, or do you think that's okay ?,Mass shootings kill hundreds in America, when do we institute meaningful gun reform.
Guess he learned from the Democrats on how to exploit situations.   Democrats are professional victims !,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Jeff Cole , what about the millions of babies being killed through abortion that the liberals think is a woman's right ?   Do you feel their pain also ?,What about the hundreds of families who have lost a child to gun violence in their schools? Why do you not own their pain?
Are you talking about abortions ?  That would be millions !,And how many Legal  (Americans) have killed the daughters of other Americans ??
Jim Butkowsky , over seven percent of the illegals coming into our country end up in prison which is higher than our legal population.,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Higher than our national average.,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter.

So are abortions, which is worse ?,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
How about doing it the legal way  ?,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Hey zippy, we don't need to import more criminals we have enough of our own !,Wendi DelValle Umm I’m not trying to be a dick but what if it was someone else? Would you want a wall then?
Seven percent of the illegals crossing our southern border end up in our prison's.  We don't need to import more problems !,I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
Danny Jones it won't matter. Within one more generation the Muslims will have bred themselves into a majority in the UK, and your "culture" will be gone forever anyway.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Hal Eric Mitlitsky you're a moron! If it stops just one, that might be the one that would have killed your daughter or son. Stop listening to CNN,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Hal Eric Mitlitsky if there ever will be another democratic president. All the reasons you just mentioned are reasons why there shouldn't ever be one again.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
The aggregate world debt is 238 trillion dollars, with cyber security threats adding a trillion dollars a year to that alone. Unsustainable.,The only question that remains now is, have the Democrats fundamentally transformed America enough, to accept that we do not hang people anymore for, High Treason.

DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old.

The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9. Air Traffic Controllers, who were already suffering a 30-year staffing low, have been feeling the strain of going unpaid. Some have begun quitting. 10. With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21. The FTC's identity theft reporting system is shut down. 22. Student loans are being delayed as universities are unable to verify parents' income with the IRS 23. Small Business Administration loans have been delayed. 24. Domestic violence shelters that receive federal funds have been forced to cut services. 25. Highway and transit projects are being delayed or canceled. 26. Wildfire preparations in western states are delayed. 27. The National Hurricane Center's research has been delayed 28. The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo are closed. 29. Funding for Section 8 housing assistance has lapsed, placing low-income families at risk of eviction. 30. Civil cases in federal court have been delayed. Lawsuits against Donald Trump in federal court are on hold.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.

Rua Wihongi I’m sure the people not getting a paycheck feel the same way,Waste of a life... how many more die while Dems debate... blood on their hands
Buck Strunk THANK YOU 🙌🏻🙏🏻👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🇺🇸,No other country has open borders why should we
Katy Chavez yeah “sis” because mexicans are the ones illegally crossing the boarder 🤦‍♀️ y’all stay on your own fuckin side and it wouldn’t be a problem to begin with. duh,i just don’t understand how people don’t support the wall. we have walls everywhere. we’ve been using them to keep INTRUDERS out for damn near forever. do you not use walls to keep your home safe? do you not lock your door to keep intruders from entering ILLEGALLY?? why is this such a hard concept for y’all to grasp? it makes perfect sense. 🤦‍♀️
Thank you Steve!,Smart girl Brooke Cloninger.
Better start using spell check if you want run your mouth,Dims see illegals as future voters sense they have lost their base to far left
Janey Renteria Truth hurts libturd,Dims see illegals as future voters sense they have lost their base to far left
So glad Killary lost,Dims see illegals as future voters sense they have lost their base to far left
That's good don't care what you think bye bye,Dims see illegals as future voters sense they have lost their base to far left
Your out alright out of your mind,Dims see illegals as future voters sense they have lost their base to far left
Well John Wheeler that’s on Chucky and Nancy as they both voted on a wall several times and both have walls around their MULTIMILLION dollar estates however NOW the wall is immoral !?! REALLY?!  Do you have a fence/ Barrier in your back yard John !?! Do you lock your doors at night or when you leave , of course not as that would be moronic and irresponsible ...just like chucky and Nancy are being now !! It’s not a rubix cube Johnny baby !! 🙄🙄🙄🙄,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Any proof of what Chris ?!? 🤨,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Bill Miller youncantbargue with ignorance,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Dave Boyer why ? Like trump don’t Like hearing that you’re all stupid ?,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Veronica Torres fool,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Kirsten Larson Anderson and Destin to loose say hello to supreme Court Justice kavanaugh.,Sheldon Satchel  I don't see color brother only intelligence 😉
Kirsten Larson Anderson thank God,Sheldon Satchel  I don't see color brother only intelligence 😉
Kirsten Larson Anderson the people I don't know any individuals it's all being paid for by the Democratic party,Sheldon Satchel  I don't see color brother only intelligence 😉
George Mendes and where is it you live near the boarder?,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Christopher Goodwin I agree...we need more gun laws,We have more mass shootings than all other countries combined and you do nothing, but three people were killed by illegal immigrants last year and it’s a national emergency?
Jamie Bennett I agree! What does he care about?,Make no mistake, Trump couldn't care less about Americans.  You're a fool if you believe his lies.
,A human killed ur daughter it has absolutely nothing to do with wether he was illegal or not.
Melissa Lamphere just how many is a  few bad people?,Actually, it isn't. They've repaired a little existing wall, but no new wall has been started. Do a little research. Also, spellcheck is a thing now.
Melissa Lamphere so what you're saying then is you want to foster/sponsor a family of illegals? Now remember no background check of any kind. Just open your door. Let'em right in to your home. I love how awesome of a person you are.,Actually, it isn't. They've repaired a little existing wall, but no new wall has been started. Do a little research. Also, spellcheck is a thing now.
Paul Karachia ever climbed a wall?,Mr president wall don't work , that's a waste of funds, take care of the veterans. This way you will always be great.
Tony Connelly how many die from drug OD from drugs smuggled across the southern border?,Eric Helmes  Yes, put Trump in jail for knowingly hiring illegals first.   But it’s not even an issue. Historically illegal migration ebbs and flows according to economic need.  Right now it’s in deep decline and has been due to low unemployment.  This isn’t even in the top 100 issues we should be focusing on.   But, you know, campaign promises an all.
Dovid Staples Shalom Brother!  I think the problem is people have the wrong idea about a border and don't really understand the concept,Rod Novoa so is your portfolio
Rod Novoa so is your portfolio,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Allan Erickson looks like someone throwing the word resist around to try to sound cool.,Cindy Cripps-Prawak  Get ready. Our economic refugees are coming to your country this spring and summer.
Matthew Chavez the people on the ground are saying build a better wall, fence, or some type of barrier.,Buchwald Kevin Not a 30 ft stretch across the entire length. Barriers in some areas, and mainly for BP protection. What the agency is recommending has been thrown in the trash can with no explanation or superior solution.
Blaine Tundler where what countries,No other country has open borders why should we
Horacio Daniel Hernandez freedom is worth more then gold to me sir,No other country has open borders why should we
The Vatican has a wall. Are you saying the pope is immoral? And the Catholic Church!?!? The Vatican has the biggest wall in the world,No other country has open borders why should we
Zulu Dalek yez,No other country has open borders why should we
Danny your extra large tampoon.for heavy flow fucktards like you ,needs.changing .plus you have no idea.what the adults are doing,but when you get your news from.cnn.or msnbc or Don lemom you cant think.critically.You operate on.emotions like.a.13 year old girl.Very sad.Plus.you never want to debate just.call people names and then run off like the little bitches you.are.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
How many.of you anti wall people have gates and or fences around your yard?,No other country has open borders why should we
Rod Novoa Left wing morons like you are the real problem. Get a life. LOL,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ahmad Mahmoud it is not a beauty pageant.  Trump is doing what he was elected to do.,You’re the ugliest president ever
Carl Mörner we will have guards patrolling the area.  I would like a minefield but I do not see that getting approved.,Well as I understand it the wall is primarily built to stem the rotating flow of 400.000 deportations and illegal entries every year. The berlin wall and the soviet/russian border towards finland required guardtowers,minefields,troops,dogs etc to be efficient.
Jackie Lee Collins American prisons are filled with Americans.  And?  You think because we have criminals here we should invite more criminals to come here?     Were you born this stupid or did you have to work at it?,And a US citizen shot up Columbine, Shot up Parkland, don't get me started on Eric Robert Rudolph, or Ted Bundy. American Terrorist attack at the 96 Olympics in Atl. Yeah our prisons are filled with Americans. Whats your excuse now? Try again.
Karen Breunig and?  So we have murderers her and you think that means we should welcome murderers to come here?  Nope,A man just slaughtered 5 innocent people in Illinois. He was angry American male... AGAIN
Kathy Finley Hayden and that is an issue to deal with.  That does not mean we can ignore other problems.,How about all the children killed on schools?  It is always horrible when a child is killed...but we also have home grown terrorists.
Charlesetta Brown yes, Obama had 8 quarters that had over 3% GDP.  The other 24 were horrible and he never had 3%+ annual GDP.   Obama pumped money into the economy.  He invested how many billions into green companies?  Almost everyone of them was bankrupt within six months.     Obama had unemployment going down yet at the same time so was job market participation rate, it hit a 40 year low.  People were not finding jobs, they were just getting taken off the roles.   Obama lowered taxes?  The Supreme Court ruled that the ACA was a tax, this giving Obama the largest tax increase in the history of the US.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Charlesetta Brown CNN/Money stated that Obama oversaw the worst recovery in the history of the US.  Only president to never see 3%+ annual GDP and that was with the Fed keeping interest rates at 0% for almost all of Obama's 8 years.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Katie Ander I do read and you did not counter one thing I said.  You just come in with a condescending attitude.   Trump went bankrupt with so many of his companies? Yes, he has had 6 companies declare bankruptcy, pretty good considering he has over 100.   Maybe you should try doing a little research into actual data instead of looking for journalists to spoon feed you.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Tyler Rogozinski except you neglect consumer and investor confidence with has an immediate effect.  Obama did everything he could to stop any growth and told people straight up "1-2% is the new normal, get use to it."  Trump says "4% is good, let's try for 5 or 6%",Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Kelly Anders wow, really?  50% of violent crime in America is committed by 13% of the population and they ain't white.,As a gay woman I worry more about white men than brown men
Kenny Shuster except that the boots on the ground at the border said they need it..,The Wall is a figment and an fixation of Trump's sick twisted narcissistic mind! Mr. President!! Get help!!
Kimberly Mansfield compare those killed in mass shooting per year to the number killed by illegal aliens every year.     As for money to help people, illegal aliens cost the US $100+ billion every year.,This is sad but shouldn't be America's main focus there was ANOTHER mass shooting yesterday done by an American! Many people killed many hurt!
Margo Smith really?  Where do you get that information?  Did you know 50% of the violent crime in America is committed by 13% of the population.  That 13% ain't white.,White American men kill the most Americans every year. True fact. What keeps me safe from them?
Matthew Mastrogiovanni HP funny, all those things were around when Obama declared national emergencies.     And why do you focus on white supremacist and not racists of every color?,How about this state of emergency?  White Supremists, big polluters, pedophile priests and the like, are threats to the American Way: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and should be treated as traitors of America.
Meren Tinu I have worked with military from 80 different countries, there is no military on earth that does more to insure innocent people are not killed.,American arms and armed forces kills families in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and probably Venezuela and Iran too. So all those mentioned countries will allied either China or Russia to protect their beloved families.
Mike Caffes if you can find one then contact your local police department and give them the evidence.,How many sons and daughters has trump killed
Stacey Britton fear mongering?  You mean like when democrats said if Trump was elected the stock market would crash and possibly never recover?  Or them screaming that Trump would start a nuclear war?  Or that he would take away woman's rights, black rights, gay rights?     All democrats have is fear mongering.,Who exactly??? Because stats don't support a barrier wall.
Stacey Britton listening to boots on the ground and fighting to give them what they need.,Who exactly??? Because stats don't support a barrier wall.
Temicka Brown funny, you do not blame the democrats running Flint .  They get money to deal with the water crisis and divert it to keeping democrats in office and their pet projects they get kick backs on.  But everyone else is suppose to fix the problem.    Grow up.,So what makes you think a damn wall will keep out illegals?
Tom Barker not enforcing our immigration law is no way to run a country.,Don't know, that why you're crying to me?
Casey Voigt stay outta American problems cocksucker,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
Joe Nash Glad to see you are in love with the traitor in chief...idiot,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ruth, you are 100% correct! AND the people DID vote.... for Trump!,Linda Acree I doubt that but that is the American way
Brian Buckley  Yea and put the Clinton crime family behind it..,Keep up the good work. We are rooting for you. Build the wall.
,Best president ever! #maga
Justin Fields you are an idiot!,Best president ever! #maga
Justin Fields you are an idiot!,Best president ever! #maga
Shannon Malcom  Ha ha , he is your President too if you are an American , suck it up . That's what i was told when we had the fake President 8 years .,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Daniel Winget he's pretty corrupt.,Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.
Jeanne d'Eauede OMG! what a crock of bull. THE GOP has stifled wage increases.they always vote down any increase in minimum wage.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Stan Piznarski why does he hate the American people.  He especially hates the federal workers and the Coast Guard.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
I'm just waiting for it to be legal to shoot people like you.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
https://www.dps.texas.gov/administration/crime_records/pages/txcriminalalienstatistics.htm,Can you please repost this BS twice a week?.... 3 times a day is too much border security already!
you are a dumb a$$, it was CRIMINILLARY who was PAID by Russia,...or didnt you know that ??,Is this just another Russian post or has Trump learned how to di it too???   I hear Vlad is a good teacher!

you DO know it was CRIMINILLARY who recd the "russian money",...right ???,It's nice that Putin allows you to speak freely  lol
And this is why crazy people need to be monitored more closely,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Angela Lynne pawns ?? So tell me , your husband works at a prison ?? They have walls right ? Big ones ? Razor fence ? Armed security ?? Hmmmmmm sage thing our border needs .. once it happens for us all , then the shutdown will be over,Please open the government. My husband has been protecting the public from dangerous inmates and   is working for free. We have two children that we need to feed and provide shelter to! Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak . Aww he’s just so mean 😢😢😢 do you need a tissue ? Perhaps a safe place to cry it out ?,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Gary Kane Gary , how’s your vagina today ??,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Dave Callender gave me a good laugh! Bravo!,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Uhm....you need to educate yourself with a map, and how are your borders open?,No other country has open borders why should we
Sam North what does that have to do with the wall being wrong ...he said he didn't have to do it because he was making a point he wanted it to end now...China will be stopped that just happened this Mexico border problem been a problem before he got in office or ever thought about being President.,It's a shame you have to do all this for something that  as everyone can see is wrong do they not see the gangs in California or the pictures of the drugs that's caught at the border not just because you in office you the one trying to fix this...it's crazy they want it to stay the same....Do Americans care about America?

I'm not a puppet.  YOU'RE the puppet! David "the goal of a national emergency is for Trump to scam the stupidest people in his base for 2 more years." --Ann Coulter,An American with a Bump Stock killed 58 other Americans in Las Vegas.  Would a wall have stopped THAT???
David Proud It IS the point.  Gun Violence is a way BIGGER national emergency than illegal immigration...,An American with a Bump Stock killed 58 other Americans in Las Vegas.  Would a wall have stopped THAT???

Well thats true of any country except for sweden where the majority of crime is committed by immigrants from the middleeast etc. The same thing is happening in france,germany and england sadly.,Well as I understand it the wall is primarily built to stem the rotating flow of 400.000 deportations and illegal entries every year. The berlin wall and the soviet/russian border towards finland required guardtowers,minefields,troops,dogs etc to be efficient.

One of the central theses of this feed has been that Trump had a legal obligation to do nothing to aid/abet Russian cybercrimes after August 17, 2016, when he received his first classified briefing as a candidate and learned of Putin's cyberwar. Today we learned he did just that.  Today we learned that Trump was discussing unilateral sanctions relief with the Kremlin (via Sessions) *and* floating the idea of a gifted $50 million penthouse in Moscow for Putin (via Cohen and Sater) *and* negotiating a massive Trump Tower Moscow deal post-August 17, 2016. The focus of the collusion conversation has always been exclusively conspiracy. In Proof of Collusion I argued that two dozen crimes could be collusive; then, once Ben Wittes said obstruction could be collusion, everyone took note. Well aiding and abetting is *also* collusion.  Remember that what we call the Trump-Rozov deal (the 2015 Trump Tower Moscow deal, as opposed to the 2013 Trump-Agalarov deal) was being negotiated *with the Kremlin*. You *cannot* learn that Putin is in a hot cyberwar with America and keep negotiating a deal with the Kremlin.  Remember that, as of August 17, 2016, Donald Trump was one of the few civilians in the *world* with a legally cognizable level of certainty that the Kremlin was engaged in a hot cyberwar against America. His obligations from then on were therefore *special* and *justiciable*. The only reason Giuliani was willing to admit today that Trump was negotiating with the Kremlin up until Election Day is that media has so doggedly (but wrongly) said that conspiracy is the only collusion charge relevant to Mueller's probe that Trump's team came to believe it.  I think the problem that we're going to have now is that media is so invested in this grave misconception of how to use the term "collusion" in discussing Mueller's work that there's a chance the full import of what Rudy confessed to today will be missed and not reported upon.  The important thing is this: if Giuliani is willing to say this publicly, it means he's either certain Mueller already has this information from another source, or sure that information at *least* this bad about the Trump-Kremlin negotiations is certain to come out eventually. when I say "today we learned" I don't actually mean "today we learned." Readers of this feed and readers of Proof of Collusion already knew about Trump's aiding and abetting. What I mean is "today all America learned."-,I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can’t fool everyone. Open the government !
T-Mobile announced a merger needing Trump administration approval. The next day, 9 executives had reservations at Trump’s hotel.------------------Nothing to see here, folks. Lobbyists choose the Trump Hotel for its “fine service and security.”  Apparently, other hotels just don’t offer the same influence-peddling service, or the security of knowing your merger will get preferred treatment.   Hope you enjoyed your stay!,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Everybody: try to stay safe during Day 2 of the Emergency.,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
I know we're ALL terrified,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Rudy's claim that Trump, if he spoke to Cohen, spoke only about Cohen's impending testimony—which *Trump had no reason to disbelieve*—is a *nonsense*. Cohen spoke to Trump *ten times* about the Trump-Rozov deal. Trump *knew* whether Cohen's planned testimony was going to be true.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
The House overwhelmingly passes resolution disapproving of Russia sanctions relief, 362-53, a symbolic rebuke of Trump admin decision.  There were 136 Republicans who supported the measure and 53 opposed--And just to be clear: This won't stop the sanctions from being lifted because the measure failed in the Senate,No other country has open borders why should we
this was going to be a Theresa May style Brexit deal. Hated by both sides. Trump further revealed as the impotent architect of his own continuing failure.- The deal Trump⁩ offered Sat pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs...nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
I used to joke that the best evidence the President is not an asset of the Russians is that his policies have been so pro-Russian that even the Russians would tell him, "slow down, you're being too obvious.”  But the damage done to our security is no joke, and demands an answer.,I feel so sad that you Mr. President have to take so much from the CORRUPT and EVIL Dems, but I THANK YOU for Putting Our Country FIRST !!!!
The thing about the wall that’s hurting Trump with his base isn’t the shutdown or the stalemate.  It’s that they were sold a bully but bought a weakling.,I'm impressed President Trump that you haven't called a national emergency yet.. When will the Demos wake the F up. Stay strong President Trump
yes, "no one is perfect" Who among us hasn't paid a naked pornstar $130,000 to spank us on the ass with a rolled up copy of Forbes magazine while our wife sits at home pregnant with our son?,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂
"I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it.",Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
He is not just ignorant--which could be the case for a smart person or one of average intelligence who was just too lazy to learn.  He is not just allergic to facts because they tend to undermine his worldview and reveal his cons and his crimes. He is actually a full-fledged nitwit who is as unfamiliar with logic, sound reasoning, true insight, a sense of consequences, the relevance of context, as he is with ethics, or values or taste.  Yes, he is a traitor and a criminal and a vile hateful person. But we must always remember that which he reminds of every time he opens his mouth or Tweets his Tweets.  He is dope, a maroon, a useful idiot to some and a dangerous idiot when it comes to all the rest of us.  He is a dim bulb who has left us all stumbling around in is darkness. Time to flip on the lights America and see this guy for who he is and for what he is not.  Later we can determine the role dementia or drugs or lack of education or arrogance or just bad genes played in the creation of this pinheaded ninny of a cretinous nincompoop. But for now, as you weigh our circumstances and likely outcomes, always remember, it is not just bad character or greed or evil at work here...though they too are all present.  It is that our president is also just plain dumb.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
As today and yesterday and this entire shutdown episode have revealed the president is not just corrupt or disloyal or hateful or incompetent or unfit to hold the office.  He is also stupid.  That's not something we say in polite political debate.  But it's a fact.--,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Mike Levin ‏ Verified account  @MikeLevinCA  Jan 19 More Along with my Democratic colleagues, I’ve now voted NINE TIMES to re-open the govt — while Mitch McConnell and the Senate GOP has not taken a single vote, even on bills they already passed before Trump shut things down.,Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.
Rudy Giuliani tells Chuck Todd on 'Meet the Press' that President Trump 'can remember having conversations' with Michael Cohen about Trump Tower Moscow right up until the election—as late as November of 2016----If Trump Tower Moscow negotiations continued to Nov., statements candidate Trump made in late July (where he used the present tense) were lies:  “I have nothing to do with Russia. I don’t have any jobs in Russia. I’m all over the world but we’re not involved in Russia.”,Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.
DAY 2 of NATIONAL EMERGENCY:  - The President of the United States, flanked by his wife and fellow billionaires, arrive at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, FL to play golf, have fun, and spend taxpayer money.  - Asylum seeking children remain in prison camps,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
If an emergency can be manufactured over border security when illegal border crossings are near a 20-year low… then it’s a snap to make the case for an emergency over gun deaths, which are near a 20-year high.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
I still can’t get over this part: Michael Cohen paid the tech company for its campaign-related work with nearly $50,000 of CASH STUFFED IN A BAG.  Classic mob move.🙄,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
The favorite refrain from the Trump Administration:  “It didn’t happen. But if it did, it wasn’t a crime.”,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Trump looked to Russia as it carved up Ukraine, killed airline passengers, murdered dissidents and said, I want to build a skyscraper there with the Kremlin's help while I run for president. And he lied about it straight into the White House.   None of that's changed.,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Is there anyone alive who thought he wouldn’t be leisurely eating & golfing today - on our dime - at his club - less than 24 hrs after declaring a national emergency?,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
#Russia's state TV reports that for the first time since 2014, the US is lifting sanctions from Russian companies [#Deripaska's Rusal et al.] The host laughs out loud about the Democrats not getting enough votes to block the effort, expresses hope that this is just the beginning.,God Bless you President Trump! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
....McConnell, Graham, Romney, Cornyn, Burr, Cruz, Johnson and Thur's photo's are shown as though they were heroes - they are traitors.,God Bless you President Trump! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
The Court: The President said he didn’t need to declare an emergency, did he not?  Counsel: Correct.  The Court: And that he just did so because he wanted it done faster?  Counsel: Yes, your honor.  The Court: How on earth is that an emergency?  Counsel: Hasn’t your time expired?,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

#Russia's state TV—which was previously more than happy to exclaim "Trump is ours"— now nervously attempts to refute the idea he is an agent of the Kremlin. Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov complains about the lack of leaks in the Mueller investigation. They smell trouble.,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
COLLUSION!  - Trump Advisor, Stone Communicated w/ Russian GRU Hackers & Wikileaks about release of DNC emails  - Trump Campaign Manager, provided polling data to Russian Agent  - Don Jr./Kushner/Manafort met Russian Agent to get Hillary Dirt  - Russia promised Trump Tower Moscow,Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens! 🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️
Well the Manafort judge certainly doesn’t see any witch hunt here!   She says Konstantin Kilimnik is significant to the Mueller investigation because he was a link between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
He. Doesn’t. Care.--Not one word in President Trump's speech to or about the 800,000 affected federal workers, who are increasingly feeling the pain of this shutdown as it stretches into its fifth week,you go Donald J. Trump President....Secure our borders now....please!
Worth reminding folks that Trump could have had $25 billion for border security a year ago. But Trump, using an all-or-nothing approach, also demanded steep cuts in LEGAL immigration as well. So he wound up with nothing,you go Donald J. Trump President....Secure our borders now....please!
No emergency, for sure. But it turns out the BIGGEST legal weakness in Trump’s defense is that NONE of the federal laws his so-called “emergency” declaration triggers actually authorizes constructing even one mile of his wall! Guess he didn’t get around to reading the statutes!,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(

“Perfectly normal?” It’s perfectly insane for witnesses in or subjects of a criminal investigation to be discussing testimony.--Giuliani tells Tapper, “As far as I know, President Trump did not have discussions with [Cohen], certainly had no discussions with him in which he told him or counseled him to lie.” Then says it’s possible Trump discussed his testimony with him, “which would be perfectly normal.”,Thank you MaryAnn for sharing your thoughts and encouraging others ❤❤❤❤Prayers for you and  for all the victims families ..agree so important to keep fighting .. Stay strong!
Will Hurd’s Texas district alone spans 42% of the entire US-Mexico border  Hurd is a former CIA agent  He is a Republican  He opposes the wall --https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/will-hurd-border-wall-myth-781204/,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Months ago, thinking that the GOP would pick up seats in the House, Trump approved $129M in funding to hire staff in the House of Rep.  He thought the funds could be used to investigate Clinton.  Democrats won and now Pelosi has this money to hire lawyers to investigate Trump!!,God Bless Our President Donald Trump...🙏🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Im fine with Trump's proposal of temporary protection  for DREAMers for 3 years in exchange for the wall, if the wall also is only protected for 3 years.  After 3 years we can tear what's been built down.  I mean it's not money out of our pocket, right?  Mexico is paying!,You are one in million and million in one. Love you Trump ❤❤
It is normal, democratic, American politics for the executive and legislative branches of government to bargain & negotiate over competing policy preferences. It is not normal, democratic, or American for the paychecks of workers to be held hostage while doing so.,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
THIS is a key point not enough people have been making.   Under questioning Trump *actively hid from U.S. intelligence what he'd been doing*. And if Flynn knew any of what Trump was doing, so did he, as he was in the classified briefing with Trump on August 17, 2016.  And didn’t report either the deal or the contacts as the FBI requested in their security briefing, and lied about both  In that briefing, U.S. intel was *also* informing Trump that the Russians were going to try to infiltrate his campaign to influence him. It's evident that those statements (plus questions) were intended to provoke disclosures from Trump about whether any such effort had begun. Beyond having spoken to the briefers, Mueller would know from Flynn exactly what Trump said during that meeting, in other words how many lies he told to law enforcement bout his contacts with the Kremlin. And those lies, told during a criminal investigation, would be *crimes*.  That's why I have Making False Statements on the list of "collusive crimes" (in this particular fact-pattern, i.e. the Trump-Russia investigation). Because that's almost certainly what Trump did on August 17, 2016 and Mueller would have multiple witnesses to confirm it by now.,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!
Turns out, unpacking the history of Russian mafia's take-over of Fred Trump's territory + watching the 2016 online activities of Roger Stone's khaki-pleated neo-Nazi Incel tikitwats = front row seat to treason.,Jennifer Yvonne Croff you are right, but i could also blame alcohol: if there wouldn’t be alcohol she would be alive. Should alcohol be banned?

30th day of the TRUMP SHUTDOWN (Just a reminder):  "I am proud to shut down the government for border security," he said. "I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down."  - Donald J. Trump,Keep up the good work. We are rooting for you. Build the wall.
We're going to assume Rudy Giuliani was ALLEGEDLY drunk (again) when he went on CNN last night to walk back the whole NO COLLUSION narrative that Trump and Co. have been peddling for the past two years. Perhaps Giuliani suffering verbal diarrhea after a bad word salad, or maybe he was just foreshadowing the next Mueller indictment, but Chris Cuomo was dumbfounded when Giuliani blithered, "I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign. I have no idea.",Un SOS   Im  a psychopath locked in the NHS mental health system currently in hospital knowing full well  that all health care is controlled by the secret service currently being injected against my will enforced by law  Thet put images of my father and uncle on the packaging  of imperial tobacco products and stole the money physcopathically directing their tumors
While the hush-money playoffs are more salacious, Trump Org’s *willful and secret* reimbursements to Cohen also included $50,000 that Cohen spent on a technology company for CAMPAIGN-related work.🤨  CLEAR felony per campaign-finance law and NOT a “personal” expense.🙄,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!

THIS is a key point not enough people have been making.   Under questioning Trump *actively hid from U.S. intelligence what he'd been doing*. And if Flynn knew any of what Trump was doing, so did he, as he was in the classified briefing with Trump on August 17, 2016.,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them. We see this in the recent drama from Buzzfeed. Absolutely amazing the reaction they had before they knew the truth and now after they know the truth. It’s a COMPLETE MELT DOWN.  WHAT A F——D up way to live!!!
Pencil pushers are starting to freak out about Trump's shutdown, warning that if federal workers miss another paycheck, a drop in economic growth coupled with the loss of consumer and business confidence, combined with Trump's trade war and the long term sting on consumer credit ratings, could trigger a recession. Lucky for Trump, who gauges his success on the ebbs and flows of stock market, Wall Street's 1% hasn't noticed rank-and-file federal workers are on the verge of quitting en masse.  Trump's 2020 campaign manager and pubic beard-in-chief, Brad Parscale, says that they have all this polling data that says they're winning the war on messaging, but he refuses to show anybody. I guess Parscale's model is from a different school three towns over, and isn't available right now because it's currently vacationing in Russia.,Terry Clark what's Hillary got to do with anything. That shipped sailed long ago. You guys need a new tune....lol
I'll take a thousand migrants willing to walk 2,000 miles across a desert in hopes of a making a better life in America over one privileged smirking insolent snot-nose MAGA hat-wearing teenage dipshit asshole any day of the week and twice on Sunday,Todd Schroeder shame on you
btw. the House controls the Federal Budget. If you had the first clue about how your own government functions, you would know that.,Todd Schroeder shame on you
What we didn’t hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the Trump Shutdown.,Cut the Senator’s and Congessmen’s pay during the shutdown and things will start to work your way
Danny Jones  How is EU membership destroying your culture Danny? Twat,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Danny Jones  Quote Great British culture. I'm a Brit. The EU hate us. End of. So I'd rather we gave the USA 5 billion as a gift for the wall rather than give 39 billion a year to the EU ...  You haven’t really answered any questions - just added more illiterate drivel.  What is your view of the ‘great British culture’ and how has EU membership eroded it?  Do answer with specifics if you can. Why do you think the EU hate us? They certainly don’t want us to leave but they’re not going to compromise their membership tenets to suit the U.K. - we already have a good deal. How would gifting £5billion to the US benefit the U.K. as much as membership to the EU has?  I doubt you’ll be able or willing to answer any of the above - just like Trump supporters, you’re not that bright and completely misinformed.  Twats like you shouldn’t have the vote.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Elena Pate   You state stay strong and the UK will prosper.  Interesting comment Elana - clearly you know something about international trade and economics that has eluded everyone else. Care to share? How will the U.K. prosper outside of the worlds largest trading bloc?   I’m really interested in your reply.  ‘The EU is the world's biggest exporter of manufactured goods and services, and it is the biggest import market for over 100 countries. It is also the world's largest single market area’,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Apple Rivera  GB was stable before joining the EU? You really are ignorant of fact. Unbelievable. Why comment on something you clearly have no knowledge of - you just make yourself look incredibly stupid.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Maik Schrank Yes, pay more taxes, support more illegals. I think not,Eric Wroblewski thank you
I call bullshit. .,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Sheikh F Shahel ?,Chris Wren. Aguilera Samuel can you really ignore this?

Justin Dewey 74% of the voters want the wall.,All about the framing POTUS! Poll Americans and ask "Do you want a secure border?" Obviously the response will be overwhelmingly "Yes".

David Lindquist  ..handled just fine?  Yeah right...they're still busing them into Texas under the cover of night and escorted by local cops...because Democrat funded immigration lawyers are defending them and getting them.  Idiot!,

But, a WALL...well, that makes all the difference in the world, doesn't it?  You Trumpers are the dumbest species on this planet.  You seriously are.,Heartbreaking story, I am so sorry for this family's loss. Thank you President Trump for giving them their voice that Beto wants to keep silenced.
Yeah...such an emergency.  That's why it's taken him two years.  And, he's only getting 55 miles.  You Trumpers are the dumbest species on this planet; what's left of it.,Can’t build the wall fast enough.
The dictator is a fascist and and a crook and will be in prison soon.,THE PRESIDENT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!!!!!!!!
I don't understand the level of insanity from you idiot Trumpers who, after every mass shooting in the U.S. by a U.S. citizen, claim that "gun control doesn't work; a criminal will find a way to get a gun."  Yet, you think some idiotic wall will keep out illegal immigrants when most of the immigrants are non-violent and most of the drugs come in through legal ports of entry, ships, and airplanes.  I mean...you're just plain dumb.,I just do NOT understand they level of insanity in people that think this is not necessary
How can you not associate mass shootings in this country to easy access to firearms?,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
*too,Build that wall . Then build more of that wall . We just can't get to much wall .
Poorly educated tRumper.,Build that wall . Then build more of that wall . We just can't get to much wall .

God... will reward you   A Thousands time Fold  I AM ON MY KNEES BEGGING YOU TO HELP BUILD THE WALL....
Brent Robinson he has a high approval rating?  Stop watching FAUX so called news,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

Danny Jones with you Danny...🇬🇧 #pleasegiveusastrongleaderlikeTrump,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Janet Williams that's what I said too and the senate. There the ones stopping this, it's not the rest of us. Get the prisoners to help build the wall, like the frigid people,why don't you shut congress down and not pay them-then I would think they would come and build your wall
Sorry about that?,why don't you shut congress down and not pay them-then I would think they would come and build your wall
Suppose to be drug people,why don't you shut congress down and not pay them-then I would think they would come and build your wall
Danny Jones Thank you for caring.  God bless.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
But our citizens have consequences.   They get deported, only to come back and do it again,Ok now we get it, but there's people here who are born in this country and commit crimes too not just  illegal immigrants.   I feel bad for those who lost love ones to senseless acts of violence.
Americans face consequences,  illegals do not.  They get deported only to run right back.  And....how many children are trafficked across that border every year?,More people are killed by American citizens than immigrants,the wall is pointless
Because that has worked so far?  They do nothing! Let's declare some more sanctuary cities!  Oh, and forget about the children trafficked through that border each year,20% of illegal immigration comes in through Mexico, and a wall won't stop half of that.  Logical legislation is need, not a stupid wall.
Seriously?  They already are profiled.  Look at the Kavanaugh mess, the metoo movement.,LOOK!  A NON IMMIGRANT YOUNG GUY!  When do we start Profiling them???  JUST ACCEPT IT!   You and your followers are despicable RACISTS.Sacked man shoots five dead at US firmbbc.com
And they have consequences.  They do get deported so they can come right back and do it again.  Maybe if we took care of Americans and focused on mental health, we could save some lives.  There's an idiot idea,The KKK kills people everyday.   Where's the wall
Renieri Ortiz , and that is proof that we need to defend our country.  Look what our ancestors did to the Indians,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.
Sofiane Hamouda I got stitches when an illegal immigrant attacked me.  I'd report.  They can come in the right way,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.
What else is there?  They talk about security.  Obama did.  Other Democrats do.  But the sanctuary cities and stupid laws for their protection just make things worse.  They are all talk.  A wall will work.  It wont keep everyone out, of course. But it will keep many out.  And until they show other REAL ideas, I want a wall.  I have been jumped by illegals.  I was very lucky.  Protect AMERICANS, not illegals,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
I am sorry for your loss, but that American can face the charges, instead of being protected by sanctuary cities or deported,  only to come right back.,A American kill my  Mother
It wont ever matter.  They will all keep making excuses.,No trust me the majority of us we feel for those Angel moms and one was too many this walls going up
Americans face consequences.  Illegals get deported and come right back. And....what about all the children that get trafficked through that border?  Oh I forgot, our country no longer cares about children,Five dead in Illinois by gun violence. Far more deaths each year by gun violence and drug abuse. But sure.... let’s pretend a wall will solve it all.
Lynn Limauro Floyd So sad! God bless you! Illegal's need to be vetted! Build that WALL!,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
We didn't cancel when Obama was (small p for ) President. He led the way for not being one,Gods, you trumptards falling for this three-hankie story.  You idiots need to live in N. Korea. They have a very, very, very, secure southern border!  With its own dictator, you'll be truly happy there!
Melissa Negley I am praying for your recovery God loves you too !!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Dems are responsible at this point.  Their hate for Trump is so deep, they're willing to open our borders and let anyone and everyone in.,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage
Natalie Halem, is that all you've got?!  Nice try libturd.,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage
Vinnie Paul no it isn't moronic. If you are so against a wall, then take in 3 families of illegal immigrants, provide fiid, shelter, healthcare, etc and be held responsible for any crimes they commit.,Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets. But if you listen to mainstream media or the Democrats nothing wrong with our borders.
,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Martha Pickens  Yes, he couldn’t get enough votes to get this ridiculous piece of egoism passed when the republicans held both houses. What in the world makes him think it will happen now?,Prayer rugs found on New Mexico border ranches that should be enough to have the hairs on the back of your neck stand out. Build the wall!!!!
Christopher Valinski SERIOUSLY!!! No comparison and you know it.,Borders are fine.
Buck Strunk you are a moron. What other countries have you been to? Right here on this continent there is no border with Canada. No wall. No fence. In Europe there are no walls or fences either. Only in very few places are there walls.  Wake up folks. Read. Educate yourself.,No other country has open borders why should we

James Campbell how many die because of a car ?why arent you screaming about banning cars .more gun laws isnt going to stop it .,How many shootings are done by American citizens yet you haven't passed many come sense gun laws!
Liz Hall time to stop playing politics and work together for the good of our country.  The other side did it doesn't solve anything.,You better start defending then.  Why are you fixated on the wall?  You do know that border security measures include added personnel, drones and smart tech...why not use those?
Sam Godin there are already 650 miles of wall at the border.  How do walls find people or drugs smuggled in at ports of entry?  Why do you folks insist on one solution to a problem?,You better start defending then.  Why are you fixated on the wall?  You do know that border security measures include added personnel, drones and smart tech...why not use those?
Paul Baker pretty common knowledge that illegals rarely have a driver's license and insurance.,An illegal alien driving a loaded simi ass-ended a line of cars stopped at a road repair who were waiting on the pilot car to get through. The older couple in the last car in line was smashed into a pickup. The pickup smashed into the back of a loaded cattle trailer and was deflected into the ditch. The older couples car was then smashed flat between the oncoming simi and the stopped simi and were killed instantly. The truck driver was an illegal and was burned in the crash. He was taken into custody and transported to OKC for treatment. There was never any news of what was done with him but I imagine he was released and hauled ass for Mexico leaving Americans with the medical bills and funeral expenses.

Linda Leitner Martin you do realize uh that we all technically are immigrants and that there is much crime found within our nation by itself... stop looking for a scapegoat.,Stay Strong against those who will destroy our country!
Greg Merz  won't you come find out what I am.,Greg Merz  won't you come find out what I am.
Ruben Radar Rodriguez thank you for your sacrifice,  we support you and your family.  Thank you from louisiana!!!!,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
And you don't,Eric Wroblewski thank you
You stupid,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Orange man bad!!!,I hate your a$$!
Democrats are especially good at twisting words... it's what they do.,Declares a national emergency, also states it isn’t an emergency, “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.”  And goes to Mar-largo  I’m confused.   What is the emergency?  And how is your administration responding to it? By golfing?
That's why with the wall comes tech and other strategies, but it starts with a wall.  Ex...my house has a fence, door, locks, alarm system, guns.  It starts with a fence.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Nobody’s against the wall their against trump getting credit for it,i just don’t understand how people don’t support the wall. we have walls everywhere. we’ve been using them to keep INTRUDERS out for damn near forever. do you not use walls to keep your home safe? do you not lock your door to keep intruders from entering ILLEGALLY?? why is this such a hard concept for y’all to grasp? it makes perfect sense. 🤦‍♀️
Karen Harvey  ok Republican,Karen Harvey  ok Republican
Chris Jordan G bringing jobs to all Americans, signing a bill to back pay shutdown employees, making foreign countries pay their fair share instead of us fitting the bill....bring on the destruction.

https://www.gofundme.com/TheTrumpWall,This situation needs to be controlled. Unfortunately previous Presidents & congress did nothing. We do not have an Ellis Island to process large quantities at one time. Our current detention center on southern border cannot handle. We have 12+ million illegals already living here illegally. Majority are on assistance of some type. We have 700,000 waiting for vetting in court system, which is not equipped for that amount either. Fix the systems. Put up the wall until the illegals here are dealt with. When do you stop the runaway train? Before it kills people or after?

,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.

Bill Briggs,  I agree with you,Nancy doesn't want to give in with the president, then emergency order, close the borders off,  Nancy is the speaker , not the president,Please  do  an  emergency  order  and  lock  the  border  down  completely.  Mexico  needs  to  feel  the  pain  for  sitting  on  their  corrupt  asses  not  stopping  it  at  their  border.

Pelosi needs to work on the deal,Put down your gun and free your hostages the Federal Employees and then work out a deal.
Drain the swamp,,Can you cut all the house pay until they negotiate? If it affects there pockets maybe they will work. They are acting like naraccistic children.
Of course she is afraid of meeting Angel parents, Pelosi doesn't care about cops or legal citizens getting killed by illegal aliens,,Nancy refuses to meet with ANGEL PARENTS! THAT WALL WILL GET BUILT ONEWAY OR ANOTHER! MAGA!!!
I agree with you, terry, the rich people only out for, themselves,So very hateful for Pelosi to act like this. Needs to be removed from job
Too bad Putin is a really the one in control,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
I think you would need alchemy or something for that not a wall,I bet every Angel Mom would go without a paycheck in exchange for having their child back!
Deb Shriver, How did those illegals guilty of those crimes get into the United States?  We're waiting,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Gary Hooper, you have no facts to counter my comments so you resort to name calling.  It's classic for your type!,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
In a sense, the wall merely represents the Trump administration’s worst instincts and desires. It is harmful, wasteful, and offensive, but an ineffective wall is nonetheless better than the surge of 5,000 new Border Patrol agents and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to round up and deport people that the president also wants. No wall has ever arrested, robbed, battered, or murdered nonviolent people, as immigration enforcement has. A wall will not create an interest group to lobby for itself, endorse nationalist presidential candidates, and demand more power and funding, as the Border Patrol union does. The wall is more than a symbol. It will harm the lives of thousands of border residents and immigrants while wasting billions of tax dollars. But in a world run by nationalists, the one small source of comfort for non-nationalists over the next four years may be the knowledge that it could be worse.  -  D.  Bier - Cato Institute,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Larry Fields, they are not all criminals just as all Americans are not criminals.  Not allowing those entrance who are seeking refuge or a better life is criminal!  Goodbye!,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Laurel Balinski, there is nothing   illegal about them  if they haven't entered the United States!  Can't refer to them as illegal immigrants.   It's your comment that's wrong!  Why is YOUR FB PAGE FAKE?,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Laurie, get a real FB  page before replying to my comment.  Yours is fake,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.

Sandy Seaney Mahady, make sure your relatives are not in schools where an active shooter might enter,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Tim Somolitis, the Republicans are divided about the need but either way, a person who listens to a proven compulsive liar who can neither negotiate or make a deal and wasted 6 billion dollars of taxpayer money shutting the Gov down over money for a Wall that he said Mexico said they would pay for, is in no position to suggest who others should  listen to 😂😂  Bottomline, it's clear that the politicians will deal with this in court.  The first of many lawsuits have already been filed about what they call a " Manufactured Crisis" in order to bypass Congress,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
You people need to believe the experts and not lying Trump.    A Border Wall isn't the answer. Most illegal immigrants overstayed their VISAS or entered through legal points of entry.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Pay attention please.    Experts have reported that  "The Wall "  will not keep out illegals.  Therefore, the 8 billion dollars that Trump wants for a wall  will be in addition to the amount paid out for Medicare, Medicaid and food since the Wall will not be effective.    Most illegals overstay VISAs or they come in through legal points of entry.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.

In February 2009, Congress approved Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus package. It cut taxes, extended unemployment benefits, and funded public works projects.  The recession ended in July 2009 when GDP growth turned positive.  In just seven months, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act pumped $241.9 billion into the economy. That increased growth to a robust 3.9 percent rate by early 2010. By March 30, 2011, almost all ($633.5 billion) of the funds were spent.   2. Modernized the Auto Industry Obama bailed out the U.S. auto industry on March 30, 2009. The federal government took over General Motors and Chrysler, saving three million jobs. It forced the companies to become more fuel efficient and therefore more globally competitive.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Victoria Deobald, Trump needs to explain why he didn't have Hillary arrested as he promised.  Instead, those who he surrounded himself with have been arrested jailed & sentenced.  This is the most corrupt White House in history!    75 INDICTMENTS,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Brought us out of a recession.  That's why he was elected again,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....

Beverly Hurst Smith BINGO. He and the GOP didn’t do anything because the didn’t want the fallout. All of this crisis stuff and shutdown stuff is for Trumps base. It could have already been funded and in progress by now. THEY HAD ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Brenda Flores he did not say that,I can not believe Beto said he would abolish the Constitution today! He said no one follows it anyway! If that is NOT a verbal acknowledgement that the Democrats are trying to eleminate our laws.. Which is TYRANNY!  That verbal statement shows that we are fighting a domestic enemy! These people slipped through our system that failed to prosicute these people for their self confession of taking out the constitution! Why arent you people holding those accountable for stating this is their agenda..  And they sit in as a member of congress who are allowed to make laws and change them.. And no one is doing anything about it? Why? We demand answers!

Can you think of a reason he didn’t do it when he could?,Charlie Daboub you realize that he needs the Democrat’s support to fund the wall right? And you realize that the Democrats and Republicans and our last handful of presidents could have also built it, and done other things, but failed to do so. And they claimed they were in support of it until Trump got elected. 🤷🏽‍♀️ He has done what he can so far with it.

Can you think of a reason he didn’t do it when he could?,Charlie Daboub that's an easy one.... to build the wall requires funds. Since we have 3 or 4 rino's it was blocked. Trump even stated he would be ok with it not getting approved in 2018 but he would put up a fight for it in 2019..... hence, we are here and he isn't rolling over like the way republicans have been known to do for the last 20 years.  Let me know if you need anymore schooling.......

Arturo Elroy Mañana good point but it would be alot harder if they had to scale over a steel slated barrier..,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.

Cindy Cripps-Prawak it seems that Trump is the only one trying to open the government. He went from a wall to fence sections and offered everything that the Dems wanted. Security on the southern border is a real concern and must be fixed. But liberals like illegals voting for them,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Cindy Cripps-Prawak trump said he would own the shutdown. It was his, but now it isn’t anymore. This is a Pelosi shut down. Plain and simple.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Todd Schroeder trump has been at the whitehouse waiting for dems to come negotiate... that’s how our government works. If Democrats won’t make a deal then who is really keeping it shut down?,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
James Begert why? So dem lawyers can find a friendly activist judge on the 9th circuit in California and get a nationwide injunction against it? No thanks. Congress needs to do its job.,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Norene Boone the ACA was not a republican bill... gtfoh with that nonsense.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Robert you're smart.,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
Davita Levao Jesus would confront him like he did the Pharisees. Except the Pharisees didn’t actually teach hate and intolerance. So Jesus would have a field day with teaching the president,And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.             Thank you Jesus for Trump and Pence.
Jennifer Smith let me guess u r proud of the ladies in white....baby killer club,You’re a Moran president Trump!!! YOU are the National emergency! Impeach Trump now! Stupid narcissist
Worley Michael, you are an idiot, we need to send fools like you to Mexico and South America with the rest of the ilegals and build our wall to keep you out.,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.

Hey moron you cant remove a president just because you don't like or agree with him, besides do you want illegals invading our country, if you do how about doing us all a favor and go to Mexico and support them. Its bad enough that Indians from India are taking over our hotels and convenient stores.. Build the wall Trump 2020...,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Terrorists aren’t coming through Mexico.  We do have people coming down from Canada, 95% by air or tunnels.   The wall at the Southern border makes little sense except to make it difficult for vehicles.  I live in NYC.  People climb 80 story buildings here so a 10 or 20 ft concrete wall would stop nothing.  Also right now more Americans are moving to Mexico than coming here.  You can live well in many areas for very little money.,Right now we need security at our airports where we are actually stopping thousands on our terror list. Agents aren’t being paid.  You sir are a fraud.   Do us a favor and crawl back into your reality tv hole    You make a piss poor human.
Uh...I don't think Italy will have to come up with the money.  Stay in your own lane. :-),It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
Paul Chiplock, got any facts?  Or just blubbering?,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don’t want this wall.

Sandra Nelson Ask the Chinese: Or the French. Trump wants to ignore the stats saying illegal immigration has been declining for two years, cause he just wants his wall. He's a freakin' xenophobe and frankly when he's gone THEN we can start being great again,Walls do not work
Not really.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Albert Kojo Kyekye me 2!! America should stand up for this brave man as he takes on the most corrupt warmongering political monsters on Earth.,Eric Wroblewski thank you

Tim Furey You are receiving this Message Because the Utterly Ridiculously Stupid Award is No longer Available So Quit Competing. Thank you,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Ruben Radar Rodriguez worried more about a wall than healthcare?,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
All the men that dont support the wall or the president sit down to pee. All the women who dont support him are hung like male orangutans. Thanks Obama for your roles reversing gender crisis,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Cindy Cripps-Prawak   What's mean spirited is the fact that democrats care more about the illegals than they do the voters that elected them.  Why do Democrats support and defend illegal immigration, even declaring "sanctuary cities and States", and also resist voter ID?  How does supporting illegal immigration and fraudulent voting benefit the average US citizen? Any citizen?  How could anyone vote for any Democrat and think themselves a patriot?,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Mike Donovan if thoughts and prayers keep the children safe it should keep the border safe to,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Kay Mike White LIBERAL males you mean, no but more people are murdered by illegals than white kids, and teh illegals can be dealt with only this way, I dont think there is a cure for liberalism sorry.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Lisa Vocelka No you libtard you need to build that wall and evivt the illegals, Bad the magic Kenyan done that as he promised this guy would noy have lost his daughter to an illegal scumbag.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Cindy Cripps-Prawak Just like Obama did! Maybe Trump should fine all the libtards who don’t support the wall... like Obama did!!!,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
James Kenney Dude stop trolling. The man has billions. I’m quite sure he has a better grasp on numbers then your petulant self will.,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Kathleen Scott their salary from Congress is nothing compared to the money they get from their corrupt doing with lobbyists.,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Trump does more in his sleep than Obama did in 8 years. 😄😆🤣,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Attention All Democrats: Trump IS still your President. COMRADES! 😄😆🤣,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
Dave Callender You’re an idiot. Of course Americans kill others in accidents. The point is that if these uneducated, illegals never came here those deaths they caused never would’ve happened. If the wall saves just one life it’s worth it.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
I don't pay much attention to Numbers.....I talk to People and Look at the way people are Living.....,Hey Dude.....Rebuild America's Middle Class......You're The Smartest Man that's Ever Lived......You Can Do It......!! You're a Big Boy.....!!!
He could have had his budget approved under the republicans.  This is just a tactic by him to entice fear into people,Didn’t you have 2 years to do this when republicans held all levels of government ?
Sacramento Mendoza,Ok now we get it, but there's people here who are born in this country and commit crimes too not just  illegal immigrants.   I feel bad for those who lost love ones to senseless acts of violence.
Sacramento Mendoza,Ok now we get it, but there's people here who are born in this country and commit crimes too not just  illegal immigrants.   I feel bad for those who lost love ones to senseless acts of violence.
And your point is? Every little bit helps.,Thank you Mr President! For listening to us Americans who care about our country and fellow Americans!
I think you're thinking of the last person to occupy the Oval Office.  He's the one who went around bowing and apologizing to everyone.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Technology would do more, for less, but a scalable, tunnelable wall is the best thing his simple mind could come up with.,democrats know they need the wall they have said it in the past many time about border security BUT they don't want to give into trump. If it saves one life, just 1 life, then it was worth it
Kelly Belden While I find your inability to provide any defense of Dumb Donald at all hilarious, your inability to do it without bringing up a party I didn’t vote for either makes laughing at you even more fun! Sad!,So since you want to defend the borders, you’ll drop the plan for a wall that will literally never perform as promised.   We need freedom more than anything else, and you are even more anti-freedom than the last 5 dingbats in chief
Presley Mark I think you're so stupid that you don't know what your own position is. Have fun with your liberal, socialized, anti-private property wall.,So since you want to defend the borders, you’ll drop the plan for a wall that will literally never perform as promised.   We need freedom more than anything else, and you are even more anti-freedom than the last 5 dingbats in chief
Presley Mark That’s because the average person who comes over the wall using a ladder has more to offer America than you, the supporter of a democrat who wants to build a socialized wall using eminent domain, stealing property from Americans to build a wall that will stop virtually zero illegal immigrants or drugs. Have fun with that, ya lib!,So since you want to defend the borders, you’ll drop the plan for a wall that will literally never perform as promised.   We need freedom more than anything else, and you are even more anti-freedom than the last 5 dingbats in chief
Presley Mark so he’s going to trigger himself and the fools who voted for him? That’s cute, cause they’re usually too dumb to see that they’re on the losing end of his policies. Dumb!,So since you want to defend the borders, you’ll drop the plan for a wall that will literally never perform as promised.   We need freedom more than anything else, and you are even more anti-freedom than the last 5 dingbats in chief
Kelly Belden I always enjoy when a snowflake who is unable to defend Dumb Donald on his own merits (as he has none) makes something up about the person they talk to and thinks they've done anything but make themselves and their candidate look like trash. Enjoy!,So since you want to defend the borders, you’ll drop the plan for a wall that will literally never perform as promised.   We need freedom more than anything else, and you are even more anti-freedom than the last 5 dingbats in chief
We have a fence to my backyard and someone went over it,Trump neglected to say when he described what a wall could do , he said they walk around it but forgot that they tunnel under

Beverly Hurst Smith wimpy a*# republicans wouldn’t do their job! WIMPS WIMPS WIMPS ..that’s why it didn’t get done! Repubs are Dems in disguise,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
I'm reporting John n Karen Morris on suspicion of being in the US illegally. Is that one or two of you?,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.
Dan Loeffler with you right there, along with the President,We are with you President Trump don't let these liberals stop you. The constitution says the President is responsible for security of our boarders.
He's been trying to open it everyday you goof but Pelosi and Shumer are playing games,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again

Drunk driving is already illegal. Police are given tools to stop it,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.
Charlesetta Brown the recession was in 2007 and 2008. He did nothing to end the recession. It was the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates to 0.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Sam Twal just stay in your own little world that the rest of us call California,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
No because the money set aside for Homeland Security in the future will only be raided by Democrats and used on welfare, abortion and the climate,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Further, none of us can change yesterday. It's today and tomorrow we must deal with. Build it now, and take away the magnets.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
All President has to do is call a national emergency, press the button (its his call) and this will shut down the Government a lot longer than the record of 28 days is now,I'm impressed President Trump that you haven't called a national emergency yet..

Lara Estes Climate change is a big hoax (nobody says climate never changes, BTW). But why change the subject, we're talking about the wall here.,I notice everyone who says a wall is useless, senseless or stupid has walls in their homes. Some even have giant walls or fences around their perimeters.
Latoryaira Schnell Peoples Also, something like 80% of the girls taking the journey from Central America to the US are raped along the way. Who knows how many died along the way. I guess you don't really care about them either. I also figured, you don't care much about the angel families who has members killed by illegals, just and Nancy and Chuck who would even meet with them.  That's surely very compassionate and putting America First (not).,I notice everyone who says a wall is useless, senseless or stupid has walls in their homes. Some even have giant walls or fences around their perimeters.
Latoryaira Schnell Peoples If you want to keep bury your head in the sand, sure. Here's just one study in Arizona:  "This data do not rely on self-reporting by criminals. Undocumented immigrants are at least 142% more likely to be convicted of a crime than other Arizonans. They also tend to commit more serious crimes and serve 10.5% longer sentences, more likely to be classified as dangerous, and 45% more likely to be gang members than U.S. citizens."  https://crimeresearch.org/2018/01/impact-illegal-aliens-crime-rates/,I notice everyone who says a wall is useless, senseless or stupid has walls in their homes. Some even have giant walls or fences around their perimeters.

Nola Combs "Everyone" implies a majority.  This is complete bullshit.  The majority do not want this, because they can read and understand facts.  It's a waste of money.,Working together requires you to actually give up the idea of a stupid, pointless wall no one wants.  Learn how to collaborate and work with people who have different views than you and learn how to separate fact from fiction.  There are already plenty of bills waiting to be passed that most people ACTUALLY approve of.  Stop acting like a spoiled child.

Brian Roy I personally am against abortion and think late term abortion should be illegal, but I'm not about to push my opinion on anyone so I support free choice .,Mass shootings kill hundreds in America, when do we institute meaningful gun reform.
Daniel Alexander Allen Please provide a link to back up that statement or do you just make stuff up as you go along?,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.
Does Canada have a wall? 🤔,No other country has open borders why should we
"As husband, the loyalty to my wife is at my highest and most important duty." -Not Trump  😂,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂
Cynthia Hill are you really defending Trump and his "sudden" dedication to his promises? 😂,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂

I voted for the guy, but I've worked construct for 25 years and every Hispanic I've talked to over two decades, all came over on a plane.   90% of the world's heroin originates in Afganistan,  a country we control with a very powerful military.  So if f16's, machine guns, an ocean or two cant stop the drugs, how the hell is a wall going to? 🤔,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂

As we know, there are already numerous tunnels under portions of our existing walls.  And there will be more.  Should we build motes around the walls?  I'm all for border patrols, drones, technology as well as sending more personal to the border to expedite the deportation process if the illegals don't qualify for asylum.  A wall would bring a false send of security.,As we know, there are already numerous tunnels under portions of our existing walls.  And there will be more.  Should we build motes around the walls?

Lisa Mann yes Americans kill Americans..... doesn’t mean we should import murder and other violence.  Ahhhh there it is.....  he’s rich, he can pay for it......   moron,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
You’re a fucking idiot. Or a paid trump poster.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Keith Webber Jr. not too bright are you???.....sad,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Anthony Clark wondering why Obama didn't fix it,Why isn’t mexico paying for it? 😂😂😂 damn y’all dumb 😂😂
Hal Eric Mitlitsky why wouldn't a wall work??? i want to hear your thought,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Build that wall. It'll do wonders for america,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.

Michael Mont Pas there is no god😂😂😂😂😂😂,#WALKAWAY
With you and your friends do you always put yourself first or are you kind to your friends so they will be there for you later on?,I feel so sad that you Mr. President have to take so much from the CORRUPT and EVIL Dems, but I THANK YOU for Putting Our Country FIRST !!!!
You know the pic is photoshopped, right? They fixed his hair, made him thinner, and elongated his fingers.,Wow you look great! Must feel good to lose all that weight! Congratulations
It's a distraction and a waste of money.,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Why? It's a waste of money and wont do anything more than border patrol is doing now. If there is a section of the wall not being supervised anyone can go over or under it.,Never give in, never surrender! Build the wall
He forgot to address the tunnels.,Your promise was Mexico was paying for the wall but taxpayers.
Michèle Biwer-Erpelding That was very, very different. The immigrants that came here at that time worked 24/7 to make this Country great. The ones coming here illegally now just want hand outs and don’t want to work. You live in Germany. Why do you care when your Country has been taken over by Islam??,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Chris Jordan G Baby Trump?  What’s your problem?,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Jeri Howard Askew Michele isn’t even from the USA. Not sure why she’s so opinionated about the affairs in the USA.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

Marj Mansley Calderwood and you insult without contradicting anything she said. The left have no answers, all they do is attack a person for speaking up.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Marvin Shneider now that's a typical left response, attacking their appearance and trying to put down people. Why do you do that? I believe your life is so bad, you want the rest of us to be as miserable as you are. Why don't you address her comment instead of hating on her?,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.

considering the fact that where it is already, it's effective 90%-95% kind of debunks your comment.,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Bob Segal since most of us haven't done polls, I perceive it's at least 20% higher than that.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down.

Larry Mitchell well, apparently it does by your comment. And you are wrong about them not being investigated. I read just yesterday killiary has to account for her deleted email, they want to question her again. Ohr just testified, a lot of people are nervous about that, esp. Mueller, who knew the dossier hadn't been verified yet still went ahead to obtain a warrant. Ignoring the facts as they are is typical of the left. The hatred for our President, doesn't allow anything else in those little brains of yours.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
James Ahssanipoor lies again? why? is it impossible for the truth from the left? seems not.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Stephen Pierson nope, He's ours for 6 more yrs.,Awesome good work we need someone like you in Australia to take a political stand like you 💯👌👍
Valerie Lynch rather you than him.,Awesome good work we need someone like you in Australia to take a political stand like you 💯👌👍
Jeremy Stephens wow, talk about delusion. Ohr testified a lot of things, some of them back to mueller. It's getting very interesting. Do you realize just how many investigations are ongoing at this time into the abuse of fisa court and abuse of power? Guess not.,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Mischeal Trala well duh. It's a crime. and is being investigation as you deny it. Try to research.,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Buck Strunk changed has to start somewhere right so build the wall it's a start on cleaning up the drugs. Unless you want the drug.,No other country has open borders why should we
Angel Neavin Im sorry to hear that and hope they are ok. When I was 14 years old a car load of illegals had been drinking and they ran into my cousin and her friend (in Texas) who were on a motorcycle. They were killed.,My mom was hit by an illegal immigrant and he tried to drive off. He pulled out in front of her and totaled her car. On another occasion my dad was hit by one going the wrong way and drunk on the highway. Totaled his car and hurt him pretty bad.

Estefania Torres Restrepo The southern border might as well be considered a port of entry. Cause they sure as heck enter through it. We cant just have open desert between the two countries where people are free to roam back and forth.,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Jordan Miller I think there is still outrage but personally I dont see or hear about as many Russians or Ukrainians walking or driving across the desert to illegally gain entry into our sovereign nation. We cant just have wide open deserts without any type of boundary. Its been open for years and our citizens have been having to deal with people illegally crossing borders, no Social Security number, not paying taxes, never go back to court to secure legal status and then get involved in crimes of which the wordt of course is murder whether its from drinking and driving or from gang violence. Either way, at some point we have to have a stopping point. Trump may not be a polished politician but he is the only POTUS so far who has had the balls to secure our borders,Wendi DelValle if a white guy would’ve done the same thing, would you be wanting to banish white dudes from the country? Sorry for the loss of your brother.
Joseph Nowik its not an overreach. Since the 1970s therr has been nearly 40 national emergencies declared. Its only because it Trump the snowflakes are crying.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Franco Corso trump republicans deplorable🙄,Donald J. Trump==>just make an announcement we don’t need the wall and be reassured the Dems will backfire You that we need the wall.
Richard McGrath They mayor of NY just announced free medical care for all illegals in NYC,,,,,,They will probably flock here so the rest of NY can again pay for NYC's stupid crap. ',BUILD THE WALL MAGA ALL THE WAY!!!!
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF WE THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS  DO NOT WANT A STUPID WALL  I CAN FLY OVER A WALL, CLIMB OVER A WALL OR TUNNEL UNDER   I CAN ALSO TAKE A BOAT,  OR I CAN COME IN THROUGH EUROPE AND CANADA.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Albert Kojo Kyekye Russian troll,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Kris Landers the point is that if you ignore one Law,  you probably think you're above any Laws.  My sister in Law came here legally, loves and respects this country and feels others ALSO need to wait in line and do it legally like she did!,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Robert Dahlquist very good point. And very true! That's why as Servers, we are trained and certified about these things since we can be held responsible.,Sad things happen all the time.

Betsy Hammond  I am a diabetic I pay for insurance and still have to pay for it!!! I still want the wall and back my President!  He is NOT to blame for the high insurance costs thank Obama the worthless one He did that to you NOT Trump!!! So jump on Obama’s page and let him k ow how you struggle. Trump works for FREE for Americans he can only fix things obama destroyed so fast,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.
Daniel Alexander Allen  well said,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.
Jeanie Railsback  sounds like the doctor was the issue! Not the world,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.

Keith Webber Jr.  ahh ha yet the Dems think they have a fight lol wow,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Kent Wojahn  well said!!,Thank you Mr Trump...Illegal Immigration costs us way more each year than building the wall.  Prior presidents have wanted to do this but never got it done.  Well sorry people, like him or not President Trump has been working for me, and you, and finally putting America first since he took office.  The economy is good, unemployed the lowest its even been, the military is getting stronger, and Trump is working to get all of the unfair deals and so on that the US has been getting screwed over on.  Yes there is alot of other things that need attention..prescription prices...veterans..elderly...homeless people, revamping the welfare system...but I think Trump has done a good job so far and glad he doesn't mind ruffling some feathers doing what he has to do to get things done..
Kimberly Mansfield  yep by crazy people that have mental health issues!! If their parents lost control what the hell can President Trump do? Most murders are from illegal guns the wall will cut down on that too! People with guns need to lock them up better! Not a lot can be done about crazy people!!,This is sad but shouldn't be America's main focus there was ANOTHER mass shooting yesterday done by an American! Many people killed many hurt!
Meren Tinu  let them i do believe President Trump is pulling out of there! Let China or Russia pay for them now I mean their own people are starving but hey I think it’s time America worried about America,American arms and armed forces kills families in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and probably Venezuela and Iran too. So all those mentioned countries will allied either China or Russia to protect their beloved families.
Nora Arevalo  he has and did address that also keep up,Mr President have you heard of Tunnels.
Pam Tigert  well said! The media will feel the bite it’s called karma!!! Ask the Grammy, and award shows they are at a record low Americans are making them pay simply by not watching I find it very amusing,We need more posts like this.  News only reports about not wanting the wall. Never about the American people wanting it. That's why trump was voted in.  I am sure if it was one of those loud mouth reporters on television that lost a loved one they would be singing a different tune.   Or the Democrats in office.  I was a Democrat,switched over to Republican when trump was  running.
Paul Packer  yep mentally ill! Problem is they are hard to find! So what the hell you expect the government to do?,Bull crap!  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/nation/2019/02/16/man-kills-five-warehouse-shooting-spree-shortly-after-being-fired-illinois-police-say/Man who kills five in warehouse shooting spree was being fired from his job, Illinois police saywashingtonpost.com
Sam North  mental heath issues! Can’t force crazy people to get help so what is it you think can be done?  That company had the obligation to protect its employees that is NOT the governments job!! We have security at my company with a locked fence only a badge can get you in and cameras right there if face don’t match you don’t get in and when someone is fired we are all notified!!! Companies need to step up,A legal citizen shot and killed 5 Americans yesterday.
Rose Mary O  nope they generally end up dead which is nice but if not the get life not one of the last 20 shootings did any of them get to plead insanity they either got life with no parole or were dead at the scene,A legal citizen shot and killed 5 Americans yesterday.
Valerie Siggson  yep because Trump can’t be bought!!,The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that
Wendi DelValle  so sorry for your loss! The people’s president has your back he WILL build the wall!!,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
...Cheryl Ostrow ...Please Do Not Breed...,Right now we need security at our airports where we are actually stopping thousands on our terror list. Agents aren’t being paid.  You sir are a fraud.   Do us a favor and crawl back into your reality tv hole    You make a piss poor human.
...Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin ...Please Do Not Breed...,I AGREE.... OBAMA WAS DOING WHAT HE WANTED WITH A PEN WITH OUT THE CONGRESS APPROVAL..   GO AHEAD AND STAMP THAT WALL MR, PRESIDENT THE WAY YOU WANT TO PROTECT  YOUR CITIZENS. !! GOD BLESS YOU!!

That's a fact. You can always have your opinion,This is way too sad. Americans need to fight for America and it's people not everyone else 1st
yes Ricky Wallace. We all want immigrants, but we want them to come in property and go through the proper channels. There’s a reason immigrants sneak into America illegally. It’s because they are criminals or they only want to abuse our Federal Welfare program. Legitimate immigrants will go through the proper process and become very welcome American citizens.,Eric Wroblewski thank you

I do love it there! But I’ll stay in Brooklyn thanks.,I don’t want the wall!
Jason Hicks so a wall makes no difference,How did that illegal get here?
Penny Terral  paid by Soros... you mean sponsored by Jews don’t you? Isn’t that what you are saying? At least be an honest bigot.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Rick Voss you are a special kind of stupid aren’t you,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
Tricia Ann Bakley-Kralik  if they could just photoshop his spelling...,We have more mass shootings than all other countries combined and you do nothing, but three people were killed by illegal immigrants last year and it’s a national emergency?
Dave Boyer  can’t, just like his Muslim ban,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Judy Conrad  the cartels are a multi billion dollars even trillion dollar industry ... why because Americans feed off their drugs ..... it’s a drug epidemic here. If we ask for drugs they will supply. Going beyond that they have submarine, airplanes , hundreds of tunnels already in place, boats, drones, catapults... you think a wall is going to stop them from making trillions of dollars. Ha!,Duh! We all want border security but a dumb wall is not the answer .
Anthony Lococo exactly. Do whatever it takes to get that thing built! The dirty libs would!,Enough talking about it. R u going to get it done or what?
Tommy Carpenter yea Tommy I know. I was what you might call being sarcastic,This is not ok. If President Obama has said this, it would be Ok.....but not you President Trump. Nothing is Ok if it come out of your mouth. The media and the liberal socialist in this country I’ll make sure of itz
Bob Long republicans cant read anything that long.  Well written though👍,Heidi Dudek you are delusional you need to chk facts you are literally talking outa your asss !! Show me sources that state such bullshit !! Do you even know who blocked women’s Equal rights amendment to our constitution? Republican conservatives! Dont be mislead by stupidity! Trump n his campaign managers and chosen cabinet members are literally either in prison or on their way to it for criminal activity on behalf of your cult leader !! Omg the stupidity on this feed ffs ! History has shown economy has always done better under dems national debt has been decreased by more dems !  Trump has increased it !  And just a fyi im not a dem ive been registered republican for yrs ! but after them backing this moronic  idiot in the house now ! Never again !
James McCaskill because the idiots that cause most crime statistically are already here. Mexicans can get through my fence as I gave them a key so they can rake my leaves and clean the pool.,Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets. But if you listen to mainstream media or the Democrats nothing wrong with our borders.
Victoria Hall Davids YES! INFRASTRUCTURE. It is crumbling all around us.  Roads suck. Bridges are badly in need of repairs and we want to waste money. Go visit Buffalo.  Half the roads feel like they were bombed.,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Get your dumb ass down to the border and look for yourself...idiot,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
I live in Brownsville, TX., front lines. We had a steel slat high fence built here in our area seems like 7-8 years ago now. Only problem I see that’s not being addressed, is that along the border here where the Rio Grande River the apparently we have EPA regulations blocking anything being built within a certain distance from the river... So in many cases the fence is several miles inland on the U.S. side, dividing private land and surface streets. There are gaps in the fence in these areas so people can drive through and access that part of Brownsville. Seems like it would do more good if we fixed the EPA regulation and built a gap-less fence on the border instead of hindering access to privately owned land. I used to drive patients to their appointments and frequently pass through the fence unchecked in a 13 passenger van.,Those who oppose a wall are obviously hoping to support illegal activities. Search your soul. The cost is a non-issue and pennies in the dollar compared to the outrageous waste of our government.
Robert Dahlquist in some cases it can be much more. My previous job was a medical biller for a pediatric rehab where they offered speech, physical and occupation therapy. We had many patients that lived in Mexico come across every day to receive treatment that was covered by Medicaid. Basically it seems parents are having kids on this side of the border with no intention of living here, only to qualify their children for benefits. We billed over 40k a week. This particular clinic is closed now due to budget cuts, but this is going on all over.,Those who oppose a wall are obviously hoping to support illegal activities. Search your soul. The cost is a non-issue and pennies in the dollar compared to the outrageous waste of our government.
Ask why Melanoma was flying around during the shutdown, too. Oh, you don't actually care.,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Sue Morton ok, Wisconsin,Borders are fine.
Christy Grubbs I guess not,so if walls dont work do inmates in prison stay voluntarily??
anyone?????,so if walls dont work do inmates in prison stay voluntarily??
Britney Joray you talk about his daughter and your so stupid you cant read,Donald Trump you will get the wall and a lot more.  And of course, Pelosi and Schumer will take credit for it.  Obama will say he orchestrated it back when he was just a freshman chimp.  But who cares, you're getting the wall.
Steve Hopson of course they did,Donald Trump you will get the wall and a lot more.  And of course, Pelosi and Schumer will take credit for it.  Obama will say he orchestrated it back when he was just a freshman chimp.  But who cares, you're getting the wall.
Bet you didn't feel that way when Obama shut down the government to get what only he wanted, Obamacare (more money for himself in the long run). Trump is trying to get something over half the American people had voted him in for.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Stephen Pierson, the majority of Americans voted Trump in for the Wall. Or did you forget that, or are you counting the millions of illegals as part of your "Americans",Agree need wall, but don't keep punishing the working class to get it.  If shutdown keeps going, the next thing we'll face is a major Recession.   No money to pay bills, let alone buy anything or even go out to eat.  Use your executive order and end the shutdown
Cindy Sak Nowak obviously your comprehensive skills are based on Fictional world's where the same cops that you idiots are calling oppressors and murderers all of a sudden become your protectors when law abiding citizens have no guns. Get a clue,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.
Cindy Sak Nowak so you believe that when the government has shootouts with people that refuse to give up their rights because the illegal firearms owners aren't going to obey the law then everything gets better. You are to damn dumb. You say Chicago laws aren't strict enough yet open carry cities are some of he safest in the country.,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.
Democrats care about the flag (keep it holy) guns (keep'em close by) God (use his name often) and acquiring money by any means. Oh yea I meant republicans,The wicked Democrats don't care about the victims of illegal immigration. They care about power.
Andrew Whitaker he's fighting the Dems man.,I'm truly sick of hearing about it. Live up to your word...😎
Sarah, that's because you have the most basic idea of life wrong.  You say on your FB page that you believe in the basic goodness of people. You are young and havent got a grip on reality yet.  All leftists look at the world this way.  People are not all good.  Unfortunately many are evil.  That's why we need conservatives to do the work of protecting.  Your effeminate leftist men can't protect anything while wearing a dress.  Don't worry tho.  You've got men down here in the US protecting that chunk of ice you call Canada.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
I can’t believe Carl Ostenderp is still peddling his leftist lunatic tripe.  LOL.  SO funny.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Tony Perez, your next crisis is trying to figure how to get over that wall.  LOL,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Jo Sechi , Still don’t want  Illegals here period. And don’t want more gun controls. You have to realize that good Americans don’t commit gun crimes. And according to the department of Justice more deaths are committed by hammers than rifles in the US, so pick your poison and believe what you want. Gun laws infringe on the 2nd Amendment. And ban Shaiah law Nationwide too.,Very sorry and ashamed that this happened. This shouid never happen to an American Citizen. Our Congress especially the Democrats are betraying Americans. Muslims should not be in America or holding any kind of Offices either . Many Red flags from Congress going off that American Citizens must be aware of and have strong awareness that betrayal is happening Big time. We need to fully support President Trump, because Congress is against us.
James Ellis gun control 🤷🏻‍♂️,I'm sure a wall would have prevented all the school shootings that happened last year
Amanda Marioni Hunt same as using drones or other security methods for border security. You have to apprehend the illegal immigrants. Common sense says catching them as the come through gates is much easier than mass groups coming over open land or insufficient fencing. Like wise apprehending a boat is easier than swimmers.,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Mention one mass shooting or school shooting by an immigrant?  The problem here is trump that is dividing USA with his hate on immigrants,When an immigrant kill 1 person white citizens have already killed 10, I guess whites never wanna lose,  always on the lead on everything specially when it means killing innocents.  Facts from history
Really? Do I need to remind you of Hittler and the millions massacred?,When an immigrant kill 1 person white citizens have already killed 10, I guess whites never wanna lose,  always on the lead on everything specially when it means killing innocents.  Facts from history

...lol...if ANYBODY wanted to stop the cheap labor coming over the border & working in America, they'd punish some businessmen...but NOBODY in Business or government really wants to stop the China-cheap workers coming over the border.  Get real...wake up!  Business love American peons and workers are supporting their workers while they've lowered their taxes, letting average Americans subsidize their workers!  They're laughing all the way to the bank. Trump hires undocumented and contract foreign laborers brought over by some slimy company...you're ridiculous and naive...,No other country has open borders why should we
Mike Maynard ask the local businesses who hire if they care...lol...they don't and won't unless you string a few up every day until they respect you...lol...that's NOT going to happen... Businessmen are toooo greedy...plus you are subsidizing their workers very nicely...and they have lowered their taxes so you pay even more...you're the fool for thinking gov isn't helping business...,No other country has open borders why should we

Jeremy Stephens I support the Presidents policies of standing against the slaughter of the unborn, traditional marriage as the Lord ordained it, protector and supporter of Israel ect.   I do not support his language or his behavior from time to time but I have no stones to throw because I’m not perfect either, ask me if I care what u think of me.,PRAISE THE LORD for POTUS, God Bless you dear Sir and THANK YOU, you are in my prayers. MAGA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Gary Kane seriously Gary, if you believe this you are then part of the problem. It’s time to pull your head out of the sand and see it for what it really is build the wall.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Gary Kane because you want open borders you can have all the illegal aliens at your home and you can provide for them if you don't see a problem with open borders you are part of the problem!!!!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Norene Boone you mean Barry when you are talking about THE BIGGEST TRAITOR!!!,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/have-undocumented-killed-63000-us-9-11/,This is way too sad. Americans need to fight for America and it's people not everyone else 1st
Frank Betty Page it appears she drinks alot,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP

Jesse McMurray no I have a damn brain it’s called obey the laws,Eric Wroblewski thank you
We need to start shooting,you mean a wall?
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin he’s better than all the other manure we’ve had in the last 20 years or so. And he’s doing it for free. So what the hell do you do.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Schumer and Pelosi don’t care about us. They need to be removed from offices.,Two more caravans on the way . Someone is funding them and need to be prosecuted. Millions estimated to arrive on open field this year according to Spanish media last year.
lol Chicago is my hometown. Although they have some of the strictest gun laws, they're not strict enough. Another problem is that so many of the guns come here illegally from Indiana.,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.
Chuck Brantley  You're the one lowering your standards by attacking and calling names. It's apparent that's all you got. Most adults would be embarrassed to act in such a childlike manner. Same with Lyle, maybe you'll mature enough some day to hold an adult conversation.,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.
No Chuck I didn't say that. Brush up on your comprehensive skills so you don't look so foolish. Maybe your lack of comprehensive skills are causing your confusion.,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.
However stats have proven over and over again that citizens commit way more crimes than illegals. I would think many of the illegals that do come here also get their guns here since it's so easy to do so. However I am against illegal immigration but the majority of our mass shootings are caused by white American citizens. President Obama deported more illegals than any other president. It's not the crisis that Trump's conning his base to believe. Stats show immigration from the southern border is the lowest in 50 years. Many of the suspected terrorist that have entered this country, came through Canada. Trump is conning his base lmao,If the illegal doesn’t get into this country, neither does his gun he carrys
Brian Nixon do your research...the country blows that amount taking care of others, not the hard working taxpaying citizens of the USA.,We’ll gladly defend them. But we won’t pay $21 billion just to build the damn thing, plus billions per year in maintenance.   The answer is “No”.  Your popularity is dropping pretty quick. You might want to go ahead and accept defeat on this one. That’s what you get for trying to tack regulatory bills onto spending bills.  “No”. - Nancy Pelosi
Yes. There are a lot of hateful trolls.  I’d personally go build that wall especially if it would save lives,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!

Jim Butkowsky I guess you won't be saying that if it was your family,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.

Point is, IAs are costing American taxpayers billions of dollars annually (again, $22 billion in Cal alone each year) that should be spent on American citizens. So taxpayers are paying. Out the ass. And it needs to stop.,WHY ARE LEGAL TAXPAYERS PAYING $4 BILLION A YEAR FOR ILLEGALS IRS REFUNDS???????

He has failed to do everything he promised he would so far.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

If he is such a joke then why do so many countries want to make a deal with him?  The joke is on the Democratic Party. This is the first time in a long time our country looks and feels strong. The weak spots in our country are in the Democratic Party.  They care more about their political party than they do this country. We are all seeing clearly each and every day. Schumer, Pelosi and Warren will hand the election to President Trump because they hate him so bad they get nothing done.  Voters are watching them and laughing. Like Warren drinking a beer is going to get the Southern vote... That was pretty lame.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...

Arev Neerg... Just the opposite. Trump is far from acting like a child !! The real children are Pelosi and Schumer, refusing to do the adult thing and negotiate a deal. They don't want to budge. Pelosi saying she would only give a dollar? They can't see past their bitterness and hatred to put something on the table. This is not Trump acting like a child, it's the left using the wall against Trump and holding Americans hostage with their refusal to work with our President because it would enterfere with their political agenda,  shame on them!!,President Trump, ask the Democrats Pelosi, Schumer, Clinton, Obama if they would be OK with illegals/migrants climbing over their walls and entering their houses illegally, if they would be OK with it?
Pelosi slurs and can't even talk right. So what diagnosis do you give her?,President Trump, ask the Democrats Pelosi, Schumer, Clinton, Obama if they would be OK with illegals/migrants climbing over their walls and entering their houses illegally, if they would be OK with it?
What he means is had he been given the money the State Of Emergency wouldn't have been necessary.,Declares a national emergency, also states it isn’t an emergency, “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.”  And goes to Mar-largo  I’m confused.   What is the emergency?  And how is your administration responding to it? By golfing?
Karen Cadden All LIES!!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Amie so true,Agree 101%
Maybe they could take a trip to the border,Loving the Dem flight cancellation.. take that!!
She’s worth almost 100 million so I’d say a lot.,makes me wonder  what kind of kick-back does she get??????
Bill couldn’t agree more I told myself I would never have more kids then what I could take care of so I only had 1.,This Mexican lady also had 7 kids.  Not sure if they were all hers.  But.  We only had 2 because that’s all we could afford.  They want to flood the world with takers.  Not good
You heard her Omar,But Nancy doesn't care about our country!
Elizabeth it’s true she’s from California and she does care more about illegals then citizens.,I agree with you, terry, the rich people only out for, themselves
Chiang isn’t that what the extra tax we’re paying is suppose to go to.,Before you build the wall, can you finish the I-5 Interstate here in Los Angeles first? A measly 10 mile expansion is being worked on for about 10 years.
Well we know Donald Trump is our President not Nancy Pelosi.,What are you waiting for? Who's running this country? You have the power to protect this country, without the approval of the Democrats. DECLARE AN EMERGENCY! GET THE JOB DONE!
California is bad also we have so many illegals and they are getting all kinds of benefits that Americans don’t,Praise God, don’t stop, don’t give in to protecting our citizens President Trump!! As a Texan, we’ve had this problem for way to long!! We as citizens should be as safe as we can!  You’ve came at this appointed time, and you’re doing the Right Thing here! God bless you!!
Trump better not sign the bill that Pelosi sent him with 12 billion extra dollars for foreign countries for abortions.,Eh Dipshit, Open the Government and pay them now ! Stop negotiating using the lives and livelihood of Federal employees  ! WORST POTUS EVER  !! #BLUEWALLOP2020
How about this Nancy Pelosi just added 12 billion extra dollars to Foreign countries for abortion, so why can’t we get the 5 billion from that money.,Jesse McMurray yes but they knocked first
The democrats are no longer the party of JFK.,It makes me sad as an older American that can see our great country drug down the tubes, and to See all The happy face emoticons!🇺🇸🙏♥️
Lenny so true,Haha most who supports the wall seem to be in late 50-60s with no actual understanding of how it works.
Ask California we have about 5 million that we take care of. We are in debt to and the stupid governor wants more.,How much does it cost tax payers for just one year to support the illegals we have now?
Maybe we should stop the money we give them every year.,Why is Mexico helping the migrants?  Why doesn’t  Mexico put up a wall at there most southern boarder?   This is an invasion !
We already have a we the people petition and have raised over 20 million and it’s going strong.,If the government wont help you build this wall plenty of hardworking American people will if you make a go fund me account and share it on Facebook I know plenty of people who would donate... just saying.
What about when Obama went on a apologizing campaign in the other countries? Look America doesn’t need anyone to apologize for the United States.,Heil Donald J. Trump!  i have never been so embarrassed for my country than now.  Drop the hatred and quit hiding behind a symbolic wall.
Lena I agree with you 100%,We true Americans are behind you 1000%, Mr. President!
Mike this President has done so much for this country, I stand with him no matter what.,U bend on wall u loose votes mine included
Patricia why? Nobody ever wanted to do that with Bill Clinton.,Lets meet with the  17 AMERICAN women ADULTEROUS 45 sexually molested!
Is this the same poll that said Hillary Clinton would be our next president that no way could Donald Trump wIn.,Serious, Real News: My Client Resigned From the White House. It's Time for Trump to Think About His Children and Do the Same  Impeachment should be far from the President's only concern By Martin London (VP Spiro T Agnew’s attorney, back in the day)  The BuzzFeed report that former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has told investigators that, after the election, President Trump instructed him to lie to Congress has raised new calls for impeachment. But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen’s testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions “internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents”) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family — specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. — knew the details of Cohen’s secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as “deep involvement” in the discussions with Russia — a subject they’ve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had “extensive discussions” with the family members. The outlet’s two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them “very detailed updates.” If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump’s firm support in the Senate — which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House — dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President’s immediate concern is Mueller. This is not like Trump firing of then–FBI Director James Comey, which lawyers can challenge because it was technically within the President’s constitutional power to do so for any reason, good or bad. This is conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony. There can be no argument that the President has the Constitutional authority to conspire to, say, cause somebody to rob a bank — or commit any other felony, such as giving perjurious testimony concerning the President’s conduct.  Don’t forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex–campaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President’s power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer — and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?  At some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment. The longer the President waits, the more evidence piles up, and the tougher it will be to get a deal. Mueller already has a federal grand jury hearing evidence that just received a six-month extension. The President should make his deal before that body completes its work. The Mueller report may accompany a clutch of Mueller indictments.
Can’t put them at Nancy’s place she has a wall and security guards.,Nancy is a old hag witch who is trying to look good all she is doing is getting uglier by the day. Not talking looks here talking attitude.
Ray  Love it,I cant read. Im a Hillbilly Country Redneck. Rebellion is my Blood. LIBERTY or DEATH
Rob that is what’s going on here, California is in bad shape but a lot of people are blind to it. What we have is 5 million illegals and lazy people on welfare.,I found this post from a California resident giving his version of what's happening in CA.. "It doesn't matter what color we vote, The Dems have rigged the elections in California.. An illegal gets a driver's license and is automatically registered to vote.. He then gives his absentee ballot to a ballot Harvester Who votes blue and turns in the ballot..Voter ID is not required in CA.."
That’s funny when rival gang members came into my back yard and had a shot out with the gang next door I had a wall put up and guess what no one has gotten back on to my property.,Well if they want to they can dig under it like boarder patrol has pictures of.

Can't you see that Trump is tearing us apart by the seams, he divides us, propelling our young to animalistic hate.  Does this make you feel good?

Cindy Cripps-Prawak, well, he's tried to negotiate twice but mean spirited Nancy simply said "no". Seems like that's where the shame lays. It's really sad that 800,000 Americans are without paychecks but 2 MILLION illegals got theirs. Exactly what do you have against LEGAL immigration and border security?,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Gary Kane, so you are pro drug smuggler and pro human traffickers and you like our tax money going to support illegals. What exactly do you have against LEGAL immigration and border security?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston, you really need to read the proposal from the US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY where they state that a barrier of some type is critical for border security. But what do they know right?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Hey Dave, I believe that might be the stupidest response I have ever seen on immigration. Thank you, now you may STFU...,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
And you are living in the stolen land, hey maybe you should start a new movement in the country, and help give it back, by leaving!!!,NO ONE IS ILLEGAL ON STOLEN LAND! 👌👌
How about, we regulate who is buying the firearm!!?? Makes more sense to me. Regulating the firearms, isn't going to solve the problem. Look at the UK, they took and regulated those guns, so evil is jumping into vehicles and running over people in mass numbers, folks are being stabbed with knives. Yeah, regulating firearms worked for them didnt it,A madman killed 50+ people at a concert in Las Vegas — we must regulate firearms.  Or do we only use anecdote to make policy when it suits you ...

And it's not just illegal immigration that its being built for.,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.
Decline or not it's still a problem and it would help continue the decline allowing for focus to be driven elsewhere to further decline illegal immigration.,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.
I don't feed into propaganda I have seen first hand. Walls do work they are built all the time for the purpose of stopping things.  if the wall is in place then we can focus towards what comes in through ports without the worry of it crossing over the border unprotected. I challenge u to take down one wall from the outside of your home apartment etc and you will see that walls work and that just because you don't see what can go in or out doesn't mean that it doesn't.,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.
None of those are good arguments however our underprotected border is a good argument and for all the reasons you just listed along with many others. Our gov is starting to deal with American problems yet we fight them....should be excited that we are trying to do something for America.and encourage it so that it may continue.,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.

I don't think he thought about the fall out that his shutdown would cause. It's not just 800,000 Federal Workers, but it extends to those that these workers owe money to. Local businesses are losing money because residents are not spending. This is very far reaching and is affecting millions. And then there are people who are rationing their medications because they can't afford to get more while they're not getting a pay check. And I would imagine that once the government does open it's going to take a bit of time to start to generate that load of paychecks for distribution.  trump creates messes and then offers to fix them. And his base can not see the obvious!,Stop holding  800,000 innocent Americans and their Families Hostage. Reopen the Goverment.
Chris Carr All federal employees keep their insurance during a shut down so your comment is irrelevant. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fedweek.com/issue-briefs/opm-issues-status-update-on-benefits-during-shutdown/amp/,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Joseph Nowik So read the constitution. Impeding the second amendment is a big no no. We've already made allowances. Now they should fund the laws in place.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Joseph Nowik There is big difference between building a wall on our border and trying to revoke our rights. If you cannot see that you're a moron.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Jason Morgan I agree🚧🚧🔨🔨,Build that wall!!!
Michelle Hagler true but let’s make it deeper and wider then and add sharks lol but in all seriousness people need to come together and figure this crap out!!!,Instead of a wall why can’t we build a canal stretching from Texas to California instead? Just a different idea idk!🤷🏻‍♀️

Statistically, you are more likely to be killed by an American than an illegal immigrant. That's a fact.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Ange Richmond ... No... The percentage of crime by immigrants is lower compared to percentage of Americans.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Keith Dorn , Thanks I had no idea what it meant. Again thanks,Curtis Rudisail not sure whether you really don't know or you are trying to be a smart ellic. I will accept it as the first one. It is someone who has a family member, most often child killed by an illegal immigrant. Most of the time it is not the first time the illegal immigrant has committed crimes before besides being here illegally.
Cathy Collins Huhn Yes we do!,Thank God for a true American President!  We stand behind you no matter what!  BUILD THE WALL! TRUMP 2020!

Bobby Wilson: Looks like having a government job is not so luxurious after all and has its drawbacks.  Government jobs are the #1 biggest expense this country has and is the very reason our country is in such a deficit.  Converting us from a 'Republic For Which It Stands", to a never ending bloating Democracy Big Government has proven to be a disaster of which I am saddened to see that your just beginning to experience.  Our Founding Forefathers gave us a Republic not a Democracy!  They warned us, "If You Can Keep It".,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
In the Illuminati Secret Order Of Society Satanic Worshiping Group Contract, it says Congress is the almighty powerful that they are so powerful, they will take every penny then can from the tax payers and vote themselves a raise for doing it.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
Derrick J Johnston: You obviously do not live in Upstate NYS.  We rarely get sunshine in the Winter Months.  The only place the sun always shines is in Cuomo's pockets that he lines more and more of our tax dollars, with no end in sight.,I came here for the comments. (Was not disappointed) I find it halarious that everyone needs a voice on social media instead of a hobby in real life... maybe everyone should go outside for a bit...  The government has been shut down for how long? And the sun still goes up and down every day. Something to think on there
Kathleen Scott: Now you see just what has happened since we were reverted from a Republic (small less restrictive form of government) to a Democracy (large restrictive more expensive form of government that chisels away at or freedoms), which was not the original intentions of our Founding Forefathers.  Our Founding Forefathers gave us a republic and warned us, "If We Can Keep It".,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Easy to maintain the Hill Of Corruption once they have gotten their feet in the door and dig deep roots.  Term Limits would possibly help, but not the total solution either.  All Secret ORDER OF SOCIETIES, should be banned from our government.  They have no place here.  Just as JFK had stated in his last speech, and then he was assassinated.  He knew full well the dangers of having "100% of the Senate and 90+% of Congress Illuminati Members", for the Illuminati Secret Order Of Society Satanic Worshiping Group is a very threat to our freedom and God Like Way Of Life.  They are the root of evil and corruption and must be drained from the SWAMP entirely.,Willard Swanke i want a wall built deep and tall.
People live from paycheck to paycheck thanks to people like Cuomo that insists he is taking everyone's savings accounts year by year.  I just can not understand why people insist they keep voting him in to get re-elected to do that.  Stupidity has to be put in our foods, or broadcast as subliminal messages in the frequencies filling the air.,I agree we need to have secure borders but get the government open so people get paid. Granted people should plan with emergency money put aside but the reality is people spend what they make.
Sarah Knutson: But it is alright in your eyes that your leader of Canada has allowed so many Terrorist affiliated and dangerous people into your country with open arms.  A government that has stripped you of your rights to bear arms in your homes to protect yourselves.  Thankfully here in the USA, we still have our 2nd Amendment Rights to bear arms.  Tune up your own country before you try to tune up ours.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Gary Kane dude are you high?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Buck Strunk no one wants that. But a lot of other countries have universal health care, so by your logic, we should too,No other country has open borders why should we
For what?,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
So trump is god then? Hmmm,Ryan Heather Sarah Eller becaus they too fill their greedy pockets with money and will stop at nothing to gain complete control of the nation.
Hes going to be kicked out. You are loosing,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Did you start the bonfire to burn the books yet?,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
And hes a trump supporter, hmmm,Un SOS   Im  a psychopath locked in the NHS mental health system currently in hospital knowing full well  that all health care is controlled by the secret service currently being injected against my will enforced by law  Thet put images of my father and uncle on the packaging  of imperial tobacco products and stole the money physcopathically directing their tumors
You mean like how the reds worked so well with obama?,Still waiting to see an impact on my taxes and you to "fix" health care, but you do what you do best and blame someone else for no progress.
Alex Dahlen source it yourself... look at the shared expensives of the EU,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Silvia Serra Lobo uhmmm maybe you should look into what he is saying...,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
its a globalist scam... allies wanting to defend each other shouldn't need to be coerced into doing so... either yah wanna help your homie ..or not,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Lynn Limauro Floyd A white guy drove drunk and killed my uncle. We need to deport white people too!,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Rod Novoa, first thing for someone when he gets somewhere, like you who gets in USA, is to know how to behave, how to be grateful because USA accepted you, your mom and dad... Don't be so rude to someone who believes different. By mocking Trumps presiding, you're mocking more than half of Americans who supports him.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dennis Brewer the police don’t protect they run... look at the school shooting in Florida,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
He needs to post it 57 more times.,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
That quote applies to Obama. This isn't about the president, it's about American sovereignty, human trafficking, drug trafficking and American lives.,"Ego is an anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."  Booker T. Washington.
You cowardly communist sellouts need to be met in the streets in a real stand up fight. Let's see how smart and brave you are then. Most are sick of your cowardly use of a weaponized leftwing media, minorities, border security and hate for Trump voters and the constitution. You go against everything that I took an oath to defend, clown. Frankly, I think you're a low life POS and a complete waste of oxygen. You want socialism and communism so much, move out. Because you're going to remove the constitution and inject socialism here over my dead carcass.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing.

Alicia Magee https://youtu.be/hxz7b58-mxc,Thank you Mr. President.   Pelosi's home district in San Francisco is in disorder.  Homeless people sleep in the street and use it for a toilet.  Men walk around nude trying to attract other men.  Now she is trying to turn the whole country into a wasteland.  We all must let her know that we want a Wall on the border.  Go to her website and get her addresses for her offices and send a letter there so she receives a huge volume of mail to let her know we don't want to be like San Francisco.

Lets see what you guys are for lets begin,  open boarders, free welfare checks for life, hatred of law enforcement and military, hated of the bill of rights and us constitution, unlawful judges, yup I said it. Hated of our history, and faith and embracing others. Oh yeah and you hate male masculinity , and love to smoke and legalize pot. Lets add to that, hmmm, socialism, distribution of wealth free  schooling, the teachers and unions will love you for that hahahaha. Oh and go put some mask on the cows for your so-called global cooling, warming, climate thing.
Kevin Couture I just looked at Kevin's profile pics lol. I have never seen a more unattractive family lol. Kevin you should have all been sterilized at birth. One is uglier than the next. Gross,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Lisa, the wall may not be a perfect solution, but it will take considerable effort to go over it or under it. There are areas of the border that allow anyone just to walk in. No resistance whatsoever.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Camille Ortiz Marroquin Calm down or can you not be civil your president Trump is more civil than you could ever wish to be at this rate if you are going to post statements or smack remember to include the proof please have a blessed day!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Kristy Rodencal Goettl my vote for the wall counters yours so your vote doesn't count. Easy to make Mexico pay out a 10% tax on all money sent to Mexico each year, as well as quite given them tax payers money each year until the Boarder is controlled.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Karen Henderson Typical liberal worries about a misspelling and turns to nastiness, because you cannot prove your point. Have a great day.,Lies, lies, lies.

Jerry Wilcox that's divisive,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Joy Z Cohen so what you're saying is God won't forgive him for things that he allegedly did in his past, but anyone else that did something in the past will be forgiven??? That makes no sense to me.,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
Rod Novoa just like your mama huh rod,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Brent Robinson keep up the great work. Your posts have been spot on and lay out the right positions we need. As for the false data offered from the Washington Post, that paper might as well say Communism on Display with Fat Liars across the front page. That paper is not worthy of the litter box.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
The Washington Post is the most left wing nut job paper in the country and the supposed data they have conjured up is not based in fact. Sorry for those who point to the Post as a source. Please grasp the truth of this. Any crime by an illegal is way way to many. To make it worse is the idea you would defend the idea that illegals have some right to murder American and get a pass from the rest of us. You are some kind of nut job all by yourself.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises.

What they poll 100 people. Texas is only one of 48 other states affected by this. Texas is now the voice of all America. What is Texas trying to be California and New York. I love when I hear about polls cause nobody asked me. Fake news!,You socialist communists prove how stupid half of America is
You socialist communists prove how stupid half of America is,You socialist communists prove how stupid half of America is
Cindy Cripps-Prawak I think you meant to say Pelosi/Schumer instead of President Trump. What you mentioned is exactly what they're doing. The dems don't care thing one about us. We are beyond disposable to them. The more of us who have our lives taken by illegals the more of those same illegals can come here. Its a win/win for them. Sadly Cindy...people like you won't get it until one of your loved ones is murdered by an illegal. No doubt if the dems get their way you won't have long to wait for that to happen.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Frankie Pazo  Yes. As long as they come in legally. Not storming the border!!,No other country has open borders why should we
I bet all them study's where by lying Democrats,Hope Lester Weston You really think those four CBP agent Trump put in front of a microphone speak for the entire CBP? They don’t.
Amber Maki did you complain when Obama shut the government down? The president has been trying to work with the democrats and has been met with opposition from day 1. It takes two sides to work together. What you’re really saying is bend over. Their priority is only to obstruct anything and everything the president proposes. Their goal is solely his failure and to hell with America. They’ve been crying impeachment for two years since Hillary lost. You’ve got Congress “women” blabbering about going to Washington to fight Trump and impeaching the MF. REALLY? Their “job” is to represent the people and they are using it instead to fulfill their own personal twisted agenda. Now you tell me how that is WORKING TOGETHER!!!!,During your campaign you said you were a negotiator and would work with both parties. In case you are unaware, negotiating is all about give and take. However, it is becoming clear that you are not able to work well with others and are nothing more than another politician dividing the country by political affiliation. Enough is enough with this government shut down! You are acting like a two year old who didn’t get his way. Meanwhile, there are American families who are wondering how they going to pay their bills and feed their children. Unfortunatlely, not all of us a rich like you Mr. Trump!
Carolyn Davis  you need to check your facts. Drug trafficking is a national crisis. Human trafficking. Is real. The illegals entering our country are costing us billions of dollars annually. 1.2 billion alone just to house the illegals currently in our PENAL system. This is not including the impact to healthcare and the cost to feed and house them in our population.,I hate labels but if we have to have them then I guess I’m a democrat. So let me tell you my answer to your question Mr Trump. You asked, so try listening. I would love for you to fulfill your promises!!! I keep trying to see good in what you’re doing. I want to be a fan of yours! But you never promised that we would pay for this wall. I don’t like the idea to begin with for a million reasons but I certainly don’t see our country funding it! We didn’t sign up for that. Your promise was that you’d build a wall and Mexico would pay for it. So do that. What’s more important to me? Working together to find a more reasonable solution which I’m sure is somewhere in the middle. Let’s take that money and apply it to actual crises. Border control let’s be honest is not a crisis.
Stefan Edlund AMERICA is important to our President. This isn’t about campaign promises. This is about national security.,No dear. Trust me. Our president don’t give a damn about America or its security. He ONLY cares about himself and his businesses.
Marie Smith this is the most sincere democrat post I have read. Thank you.,I am not a Trump fan. I am Democrat 💯 and will be voting that way in 2020. If someone can show me some data showing the walls effectiveness and that the 5.6/7 billion he is requesting will achieve that effectiveness I will support the wall. I do not want Trump to fail. I don’t care who is in office. I want our president to succeed and make this country better. I do not support open borders as a lot of Republicans have said. I am very aware that we cannot take everyone in and still be able to take care of ourselves. I know we need to have a limit. I do care about America despite what Republicans think. If Trump has a lasting positive impact for this country then I will be glad he represented America. It is very sad to see this country so divided. Democrats are just as much involved in this shut down as Republicans. Neither side is willing to compromise. I hope a compromise can come soon so Trump can prove me wrong and maybe change my mind in not voting for him in 2020.
Kory Sutherland you’re rude. But hey, I’m sure all the illegals you want to let in speak and write with perfect diction and punctuation in English. Right? No? Hmm.,Tim Gilbert . No crying here. Im satisfied with the results.
"Here's your sign"!,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Buck Strunk especially at the expense of TSA and and Air Traffic Controllers. WTF!?!?,No other country has open borders why should we
Illegal crossing on the southern border has been on the decline in the past 10 years, and a majority of illegal immigration is people over staying their visas. But yup believe the emotional driven propaganda all you want.,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.

Amen!,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly.

My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Timothy Coleman you are an idiot,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Hal Bannasch  beware of the bull when your inside the wall,Prison walls will keep us safe from you.
Would that all felt your way,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

Just how to attack with emotions.,Is Nancy Pelosi Afraid to let president Donald J.Trump address the nation from the Peoples House? Her safety has been guaranteed by the Homeland Security Director.
Gerry Visyons he said paid, not work,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Diane Miller hahaha you really think that?,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Dean A. Groetzinger humpty dumpty trump is the "greatest negotiator". That was a lie too, right?,But you also said Mexico would pay for the wall not the US citizens and not spuriously through savings from the replacement for NAFTA.
Jason Terruso simple concept:  open govt, then get TAX PAYER $ (not Mexican cash like he said!) to build wall $. What a great negotiator! Fake!,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
Kevin Marshall master negotiator with Mexico? Not even 2 cents! Lol,Defend them and do what you said and have Mexico write that check and stop asking us for a useless wall with 1,000 holes.
Lonny Watters humpty dumpty trumpty is filling the swamp,Willard Swanke i want a wall built deep and tall.
Carl Ostendarp yup thats what the idiot said! I think he self proclaimed being "the greatest negotiator". What a fake Lol,You are one in million and million in one. Love you Trump ❤❤
Nandan Shah waste of human skin,You are one in million and million in one. Love you Trump ❤❤
Arky James who's going to take your vote when gov't employees aren't paid and quit? Logical?,issue? like what?
Ray Welch he's scared of humpty DUMPty trumpty,impeach pelosi and schumer for malfeasance and obstruction
Shirley Terry Harrow you really don't expect humpty dumpty trumpty's family to be affected. Even though he relates to average Americans. What a fake,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Suiter Kaye makes sense right?,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that’s where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don’t see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That’s unacceptable.  Anyway, I’m done discussing it.  If 🇷🇺 doesn’t interfere,  😉 I’m sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
William Taylor waaa! Get over it and stand up to humpty dumpty trumpty,Declare a national emergency and #BuildTheWall Mr. President.  Pelosi and the Democrats don't care about us.
Kimberly Overen a wall doesn’t fix anything. Chapo used tunnels, most cartels use planes. Immigration is actually going down over the years. We should spend the money on educating our citizens and stopping the rising cost of health care. Maybe with more educated people, an orange faced reality show host conman wouldn’t get elected to the most important position in the world. Fox isn’t news,Then why isn’t it being done?
Kimberly Overen because immigration is going down. Don’t believe the bullshit Fox “news” videos they play on repeat. It’s called propaganda and it’s how a lot of very evil people got to power.,Then why isn’t it being done?
Carole Conaway wrong,Your promises, Mr. President,  do not make things better for Americans....only worse.  We have people lining up at food banks so their families get a decent meal, people have no money for gas for their cars, you have no idea how wrong you have been against our citizens....the pain and suffering they are experiencing is YOUR FAULT and not the Democrats. Own up to it and stop your vindictive behavior to all of us.  Your poor little rich guy attitude is disgusting and will be your downfall eventually, at the voting booth.
Janice Rose so you are happy that actual border security is going unpaid right now?,Border security all the way
Well, UK kind of does. It hasn't gone so well at all. Hahaha,No other country has open borders why should we
Aquaman for President in 2020,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?

Trump is the best president since Abraham Lincoln!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts.

We don't have open borders. The budget proposed by the house, which is the exact same one proposed by republicans in December, includes 21.5 BILLION for border security. I'll tell you what if trump will tax the top 5% at 70% to cover costs and bring down the deficit he can have the wall even though we know walls don't work. https://www.usatoday.com/border-wall/story/drug-trafficking-smuggling-cartels-tunnels/559814001/,No other country has open borders why should we

Or was that just fake moral outrage?,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Don Jared they didn't vote for a wall,they voted for strategic barriers moron.

Laurie Dunco since you brought it up since trump refused to fund the ACA which actually benefits millions of Americans and works  and is cheaper than a wall that doesn't work, how can anyone claim this is for our safety.

Paula Zuckerman Marshall Hillary didn't have anything to do with the uranium one deal. That was a republican house committee that approved it.

Charles Knapp yet she hasn't had a single indictment. Could it be because that required the approval of a republican house committee?,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Darlene Donnelly yes it's so funny when our government is being destroy by an insolent man child I can't stop laughing in the faces of my furloughed friends. 🙄,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dodd Gross that would be unconstitutional and fully illegal and the actions of a tyrant for which the constitution was explicitly written.

And when you are wondering why you can't write off your interest on your mortgage, or healthcare, or why you can barely itemize anything on your taxes this year. You'll backpedal as he does.,I love when he posts stuff. Because then all the dumbocrats come running to say how hes a liar and stupid and blah blah blah. But what they should do is actually look through the comments and look at the likes and see what it really shows. It shows that trump will enjoy another 4 years because they are vastly outnumbered. And the reason they should look at that and accept the reality coming their way is so they can just do the world a favor now and remove themselves from it immediately.
So we should put in an ideot like killery in there right u r as dumb as they come don't like it here leave I will pack for u I no ur too stupid to pack ur own bags,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bruh your like 400 years old. There was no wall when u were born.,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Brent Robinson. What high approval rating? He only has high approval among racists and idiots. Out here in the real world he's at about 30%.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
JM McCormack. Were you born this stupid or is it a residual effect of being a trumpanzee?   Democrats aren't nearly as stupid as Trump's base. We know how bad of a deal that is.   Your "leader" is trapped in a situation he created. Enjoy.,If the democrats do not take the offer over DACA they are going to lose another large portion of their voting base...
Sharon Samuels. Really? Hate crime is up 75% since Trump took office. His followers have shot up newspapers, churches, concerts and synagogues. They've been caught planning terrorist acts and some have actually bombed a Mosque or two. There was the inept MAGABOMBER endangering the lives of postal workers, secret service and elected officials. There was and still are nazis freely walking the streets and terrorizing innocent Americans not to mention the nazis in Charlottesville that killed an American. But, your leader called them fine people.   Maybe if you keep to Nazi rallies and klan meetings, you'll feel safer.,Mary Hillgrove thank you.    have a good day
Sharon Samuels. You're not safe because of Trump. Ironic, isn't it?,Mary Hillgrove thank you.    have a good day
Great Britain.  Enough said.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Great British culture. I'm a Brit. The EU hate us. End of. So I'd rather we gave the USA 5 billion as a gift for the wall rather than give 39 billion a year to the EU ...,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

The RUMP is an imbecile, cares nothing about the US, but I do have a question for you, Are you tone death to the truth or just plain stupid ..,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down.

GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!
TROLL FACTORY,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Omar Martinez polosi doesn't care about Americans or immigration , she only appears to care about immigrants now because that stance will give her more power .,Can tell when pulosi is lying she moves her lips .

Rich Williams , youre a MSM puppet . They program you sheep,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
John Tanksley better yet give me your address ill stop by you don't have a fence do you ? Or a gun. I have some friends that can swing by and chat as well ok deary,Well, well, well...remember the 2010 Southwest Border Security Bill that obama signed?...                                                                            "The President signed into law a comprehensive plan to secure the Southwest border, including $600 million in supplemental funds for enhanced border protection and law enforcement activities, offset by cancelling $100 million from the SBInet program within DHS. Though not specifically provided in this bill, the President has also authorized the deployment of up to an additional, requirements-based 1,200 National Guard troops to the border, a deployment that has already begun."    I guess the Dims just sat on their thumbs and did nothing once again to secure our safety.
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin so you realize almost every President before him has said the same thing. You realize there is wall and fence started all over down there right. You know that right. Barrack Clinton all of them have said this. He must be great he made all that appear out of thin air I guess... Wow but I'm the brainwashed one. I've never cursed a sitting president . but I feel bad for your next one now....,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin when the wall gets built I hope someone throws you over it.. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Keith Eberlein She did have Allstate took her full $100,000 and more. I am still in pain and probably will be for life. That is not the point, most illegal immigrants came here legally and then did not leave. It is sad that their child was killed but to blame all for the actions of some is not right.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed.

Kanthar Balanathan check the history books. The great wall of China did not work.,Yes must be a border wall. There is a reason for China building the great wall of China. How about the wall in Germany after the second WW. There must be a wall on the Mexican border to protect worms crawling into USA. Mexicans have there own standard of living and behaviour.

with a key that opens the door, inside the door is 6 or so children sleeping in the floor, disgusting abuse,I’m currently watching a tv show called  border force America’s gate keepers. You should be ashamed as you are locking up unaccompanied children crossing the border from Mexico, I understand that you don’t want or need drugs and weapons crossing the border, but these are innocent children, and you decide to lock them up. Shame on you trump 😡  You are the most corrupt person currently on this planet, you need to be taken out of your position, and very soon
You're disgusting for not having normal compassion for a man who lost a child. Hatefulness is the new normal for liberals it appears.,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain

Nhanha Yhaa Bankkz not today.,“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”

SO Sorry.. but paying the 9-11 bombers $$$ for a stupid senseless wall is not going to fix anything..,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border

First off.. they are Americans..,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels’ hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy’s and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
They are the mulattos from the great abysmal swamp in North Carolina and Virginia that we freed in 1865.  This is their country.,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels’ hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy’s and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.

And just for the record you brain-dead liberal moron here's a little fat for you to shove up your ass Republicans have given amnesty to illegal aliens six times since 1986 with the promise from lying liberal lowlights that they would secure the Border here we are over 30 years later and it still hasn't been done and we're listening to the same lies from these low-life liberal scumbags,You snivelling con man!

Brandon Turner it won't  bring her brother back but it will save someone else's brother. BUILD THE WALL,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Norene Boone He didn’t really have a majority. He didn’t have all the Republicans either. It takes 60 % in the Senate to pass bills. He is fighting a group in Congress who want and like the way things are. They don’t want change like some people want. They want power and money. Even term limits may not stop it and most if not all of them would never vote for term limits. Call it what you want, but we have a stalemate. And we are getting nothing of value to us and or the country.  The only things we have gotten in the last two years came from Executive Order. I for one do not want a dictatorship where one person rules. I like what we should have and I think it’s worth fighting for.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Elizabeth Burton Steere thoughts and prayers never was intended to be the solution. Thoughts and prayers are how people cope with tragedy. President Trump has proposed a wide range of security measures for our nation schools, but it's up to the individual School District to implement those measures including building walls around the campus.,Build the Kate Steinle memorial wall "NOW!"
Ashley Archer it works at other schools. They have to go through security checkpoints. Israel has never had a school shooting and they implement the same security measures that we want here.,Build the Kate Steinle memorial wall "NOW!"
Nigel Leitch that's right boy. Build it and even idiots like you might be safe!,Build the Kate Steinle memorial wall "NOW!"
Mike Donovan , actually he wants to implement a whole range of security measures and if you had one tenth of a brain you would know that.,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.

Jason Parkerson they will pay later. It's just a loan. Time to close the border.,One of your promises was that Mexico will pay for the wall now theres a shutdown cus they arent paying for the wall cus you want is to pay for it now so thats already a promise unfulfilled and im a Trump supporter but this is getting ridiculous
Gary Kane shut up dumb ass,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
What about them? It has nothing to do with the fact that we can act in a responsible way, and slow down the illegals. No one ever said this would stop homegrown evil. The point is to stop or reduce  what we can control.,Valerie Siggson idiot
That's not the point ass clown. Can't stop it all but we can protect our border as a preventative measure. Get a clue puppet,An American with a Bump Stock killed 58 other Americans in Las Vegas.  Would a wall have stopped THAT???
Daniel Alexander Allen this is the dumbest comparison on earth. Can't fix stupid is the real problem.,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.
Correct. So why wouldn't we slow down the invaders. You want to immigrate here do it the legal way. Real simple.,sorry to say the wall will slow them down but not stop them.
You're a special kind of dumb.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
John Baron  that's really getting old man. The wall pays for itself by keeping illegals off our welfare system.,Eric Wroblewski thank you

As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Ruben Radar Rodriguez, thank you for your support. May God bless you and your family.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

More Americans pessimistic about Trump's presidency than any presidency in last 25 years  His strongly disapprove rating in the Marist poll, at 45% this week, tied his previous all-time high for that pollster. By the Quinnipiac University poll's reading, his strongly disapprove rating stands at 50%. These are very high strong disapproval ratings. Trump is as strongly disliked now as President Richard Nixon was when he resigned in 1974.  CNN,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Trump’s Slippage in Support is Real  The slippage is the worst kind—the slow erosion of support from key blocs: swing voters (independents and suburbanites) and those who put Trump over the top (blue collar white men and Republicans over 60).  It’s been registering in a cross section of polling data, not just one poll. Trump’s job approval rating is down to 31 percent among independents in Gallup. His approval ratings in Rasmussen are down from the 48-49 percent range of late last year to the 43-44 percent level of the past week or so. The Marist data for PBS shows a drop of 10 percent in job approval among Republicans and a decline of 11 percent among white evangelicals and 17% among suburban men.  And Trump continues to enrage the Dem base while this erosion in his base continues to progress. Blue collar white men being turned off from Trump shouldn’t surprise anyone, for they know the difficulty of living paycheck to paycheck. This, plus the skew of the tax cut package, spells political trouble for Trump long term, especially if a slow down, much less a recession, looms in 2020.  Bulwark,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Peter Daou @peterdaou  The FBI opened an investigation into whether Trump is a Russian asset.   And people still talk about his 2020 campaign. What is wrong with America?  #SundayThoughts #Mueller #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.

Trump Organization’s Use of Foreign-Worker Visas Reaches 10-Year High: TPM  Despite President Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric, it appears that the Trump Organization has been using foreign workers at a higher rate than ever before, Talking Points Memo reports. The organization requested and received at least 192 visas for foreign workers in 2018—the highest for the company going back to at least 2008, according to Department of Labor data. The Trump Organization received an average of 116 visas per year in the decade prior to 2018, according to American Bridge, a Democratic research group. Review of the data revealed that the visas were almost entirely for the type of low-skilled foreign workers that Trump has claimed drive down American wages. Cooks, servers, housekeepers, and farmworkers make up a large chunk of the Trump Organization’s requests, most of them making between $10 and $15 hourly. The largest number of the Trump Organization’s foreign-worker visas in 2018 went to his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Florida. Last year, the resort received 78 temporary foreign-worker visas last year for waiters, cooks, and maids.  DailyBeast,Amen! Thank you for all you do.  Hang in there. We are counting on you.
Rudy Giuliani says Trump didn't collude with Russia but can't say if campaign aides did  (CNN) Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday that he never denied President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign, only that the President himself was not involved in collusion.  In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on "Cuomo Prime Time," Giuliani, a former New York mayor and Trump's attorney, said he doesn't know if other people in the campaign, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, were working with the Kremlin during the 2016 presidential race.  "I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign," Giuliani said.  He added, "I said the President of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the President of the United States committed the only crime you can commit here, conspiring with the Russians to hack the DNC.",Thank you, thank you!

Imagine, 4 years ago the thought of building a wall along the southern border never entered your minds. Now it is all you talk and think about. Why? Could it be your thought process is being manipulated? You will say no, but think long and hard about why this has become a point of contention. If this can be made something you argue about with anyone who disagrees, what else have you been duped into believing? Think about it. Project MKUltra,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Judy Bennett Solverson, I wasn't talking about past Presidents, I was talking about you and the "belivers" in Trump. Think back to when you thought for yourself. Did you think there was a national emergency on the border 4 years ago? Now, think about the rest of what you belive currently. You and many like you are being manipulated.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Danny Jones AMEN,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
and to respond to Jay Lytle! you are illegal!!! you live on stolen lands from true americans that are struggling on reservations now! Wake up!,oh please! americans are killing americans by the thousands every day!!!! look at the news! Man having an affair with co-worker kills pregnant wife an 2 children! i guess thats ok because he was white and a cheater! go pound sand!!!
so is killing people. its not a national emergency! use common sense please!,oh please! americans are killing americans by the thousands every day!!!! look at the news! Man having an affair with co-worker kills pregnant wife an 2 children! i guess thats ok because he was white and a cheater! go pound sand!!!
Faye Cbsbl Tucker amen!,BUILD THE WALL!!
Shirley Swallow amen!,Build that wall!!!!
Levi Colón illeagal Mexicans should contribute 0% percent of the total crime in this Country. They should recieve 0% of this Countries budget.  If a Tangible representation of the Land we protect discourages even a small percent of those entering to file the paperwork,it will in fact pay for itself. While it might be difficult to see the big picture,the economic loss to this Country is staggering! Time for change.,"Borders" a.k.a the Mexican border.  Because there are so many Mexicans committing atrocious acts like mass shootings every other week *cough* that's all you white folks *cough*, illegal Mexicans don't even contribute to 1% of the total crime in the US, that 99% is done by Americans. Soooo why the need for a border wall??
Susan Casto He can't force Mexico to pay for it. Unfortunate,if he choose to stop the annual welfare this Country gives to Mexico,the liberals would melt down! They would block his attempts to stop the money given to Mexico,everyone knows this. But,if he stops even a small percent ofthe illegal  entries, the wall would pay for itself with nothing more then the costs we absorb per entry.,Dawn Phelps way to be a coward and block yourself so I can't respond to whatever drivel you wrote. Typical trumptard.
The amount of money we spend on illeagal immigrants,could definitely be spent to improve our Country! We can agree on something......,No one is talking about free anything 😂 I just mentioned there are immaculate flaws with all.of these and you assume it means free. Amazing.
you wish Rod Nova,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rod Novoa how about you move to another country that would help.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Danny I wasn’t aware that being trash was an actual culture. The more you know 🤷‍♀️,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Sorry bro both are a joke.,Stricter gun laws will protect Americans walls will not help the crime problem
Look it up the judge said that because he came from a privaledged family he would not have to go to jail....for killing an ENTIRE family in a drunk driving incident. Im not gonna do ur research for u.,This is HORRIBLE that our President would share something like this. Smh from a drunk driving accident? Come on now...this is SO DIRTY! That white kid in TX that killed a whole family didnt even get any jail time because of his privilege. But u wanna use this as a platform for billions of dollars for a wall??? GTFOH!
Shooting? Lol damn Trumpbots,This is HORRIBLE that our President would share something like this. Smh from a drunk driving accident? Come on now...this is SO DIRTY!

Trump. Just because you were able to ask your parents for money or have the Saudi Government bail you out of your bankruptcies do most hardworking Americans have that luxury. They were not born with a silver spoon in their mouth....,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Janey Renteria you need to review the law. Commander in Chief means exactly that. He is responsible for protecting this country, not the House or the Senate. Children are wrongly being used by the migrants to gain entry into this country. Our laws are outdated, and this requires action to secure our borders.,What are you waiting for? Who's running this country? You have the power to protect this country, without the approval of the Democrats. DECLARE AN EMERGENCY! GET THE JOB DONE!
Steve Tash lmao, what an argument. Obama increased national deficit $10 trillion, more than every other president combined. And Russian spy? That will remain the most ignorant crap being spewed by democrats until Trump is done. When I have thousands extra back on tax returns, I don’t give a crap if CEOs are getting tax breaks. Newsflash by the way, when large companies get tax breaks they invest more in workers, create new products, open new facilities, etc. That’s good for Americans. Stop spouting crap from the left wing media.,Nancy and Chuck don’t care what the majority of their constituents want, they just want to keep you from succeeding!
When it is made an ultimatum to get votes for Pelosi, that’s a bit different.,Nancy and Chuck don’t care what the majority of their constituents want, they just want to keep you from succeeding!
You’re a bit out of touch with majority apparently. Hell, majority of democrats didn’t even want Nancy as Speaker! She had to agree to term limit as speaker for them to vote for her.,Nancy and Chuck don’t care what the majority of their constituents want, they just want to keep you from succeeding!
Kevin Couture Russian bots are easy to spot. Nice try pos,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Kim Well when you don’t know how mafia works then you are just making a fool of yourself!Do you have an example of socialist country anywhere  with ressources that is prosperous? The wall is going to bring a lot of savings once built but the point why some people don’t want it to be built? Keeping chaos fit the agenda of mafia organisations in any part of the world,Kim Well when you don’t know how mafia works then you are just making a fool of yourself!Do you have an example of socialist country anywhere  with ressources that is prosperous?

Justin Fox oh but the money could be used in so many other places.  Let’s start in Flint for water for the people. Shall we?,Drugs still get into prisons  Prisons have walls   🤷🏼‍♀️
Justin Fox so we don’t need a wall   Feds bring drugs into this country too 🤫,Drugs still get into prisons  Prisons have walls   🤷🏼‍♀️
Beverly Hurst Smith hey ignorant one the dumbasses from both parties have been fighting him but NOW WE Have. Two thousand people pushing at our border thinking they have a right here and another couple thousand heading our way.  If that's not an immediate crisis. I don't know what is.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Sally Gillespie Bailey mm. Tell that to  all the Angel Moms who  no longer have their children....I DARE YOU,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!
Webster Lynn Vi yep!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

Arturo I appreciate and respect your opinion but please think about border patrol agents at that border with no protection against hundreds of people rushing to cross! It is impossible and dangerous to not have any barrier or protection for them. You NEED some sort of deterrent and protection for those on the job,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Lisa Palmer Fleming.   YOU WANT PESOS ???  AMERICA NEEDS TO QUIT PAYING AND GIVING A FREE RIDE TO EVERY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.  PERIOD !!!!   IT'S A SHAME AMERICAN CITIZENS INCLUDING ELDERLY, WOMEN, CHILDREN & VETERANS ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS OR TURNED DOWN FOR SERVICES, BUT A ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT GETS A FREE RIDE AND EVERYTHING ON OUR TAX DOLLARS.    IF THEY CAN'T DO IT LEGALLY THEY DON'T DESERVE TO BE HERE.  SO YES, STOP LETTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BLEED THE SYSTEM DRY AND THERE WILL BE MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THE WALL.   AND ANOTHER ANSWER.  WHY WAS OTHER COUNTRY'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM ???   RULES, REGULATIONS AND HAVE TO EARN THEIR OWN WAY.,Eddie Sturgis scared of the success .. your party better grasp what is happening to the heartland and entire running of our nation.
Deb Lilred Arrowood illegals verses what $$$ towards helping our own citizens first.  And the Democrats have the nerve to request more $$$ for foreign aid than what is already being allocated but no concern towards the safety and security of the citizens they took a oath to serve and protect.  Whatever,  some sheep keep their blinders on.,Tim Gilbert . No crying here. Im satisfied with the results.
Timothy Mueller.   Well when certain states let ANY ONE VOTE LEGALLY  OR ILLEGALLY AND DON'T REGULATE, CARE AND COVER IT UP WHAT DO YOU EXPECT !!!!   You are so "good" at math take a look at how much $$$ are spent on illegal,Tim Gilbert . No crying here. Im satisfied with the results.
There has been more than 1 illegal that is responsible for the death of innocent Americans.  And just yesterday there was a fentanyl bust that could be responsible for 4,000,000 deaths in this country.  Its a combination of problems, criminals, drugs, diseases, burden on our medical and educational systems.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Norene Boone Funny, the Dems don't play that way.  Remember Obamacare bill Pelosi said you have to pass a bill to see what's in it as they rammed another mandatory tax down our throats. That's how the Dems legislate! Bunch of corrupt crooks!,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Allyson Stuhlmiller Everyday I miss him, his face, his eyes he had the most amazing dark brown eyes. His voice telling me to calm down Dee. Only would he call.me mom when something serious happened. You are right half of me died the day he died and the other half wishes for him. He had his life planned out from the age of 6 years old.. he was like an old soul in a beautiful body. My heartbreak is sometimes too much....i miss his beautiful heart. He was very uniquely special...hes not here so every year that goes by is harder because I see his friends living out their lives and he is not here to do that. He was so full of love and life,I'm so sorry for the loss of your lovely daughter. We lost a daughter three and a half years ago. She was 25. I am so sorry for you.
Me too, loss my son almost 8 years ago.....😪,I'm so sorry for the loss of your lovely daughter. We lost a daughter three and a half years ago. She was 25. I am so sorry for you.

Devin Diamond my heart breaks for you, I am so sorry, you don't know how sorry..Build the wall!!!!,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
All they have to do is get a boat and go around it into California and Gulf!,I am all for the Wall...but, we also need to keep our ocean fronts protected after it’s built. 😢
BUILDING WALL and watched the snowflakes melt.,Mitchell James lol didn’t bother looking did you
Gary Kane you better not be locking your doors at night,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
ROD NOVOA... I voted for him and I for one support him... If you don't like the fact he is President that is fine. Get the facts straight though. Don't use such big words like FRAUD obviously you don't know the meaning.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Camille Ortiz Marroquin no WE DON"T sweetheart!!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Anne Coughlan very true, these people are believing all the lies Trump is telling...smh...i just can't believe how they just blindly believe him. So frustrating!  There are more important things to spend that money on, especially with the rich getting those ridiculous tax cuts!! Has to be made up somehow!,I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can’t fool everyone. Open the government !
Kevin Collins stop believing everything you hear!!,Dems want a Muslim pres and sharia law !!!!!
Karen Harvey he never said that on the campaign trail. NOT ONE TIME. So, he is a liar.,So we will save $12B in trade from Mexico in just this year? I don't think so.
So we will save $12B in trade from Mexico in just this year? I don't think so.,So we will save $12B in trade from Mexico in just this year? I don't think so.
John Wild there is no strategy with Congress.  They have play with peoples lives for years.  Trump is one president who they can't make  a puppet out off. Now I ask you what is your solution to border security?,No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.   STOP hurting our own citizens - it is IMMORAL.
The US has been a laughing stock Trump is trying to fix it.  He is the first President  that isn't a puppet to all the bureaucrats.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
John Wheeler how about thinking about the millions of American citizens who are disabled, seniors and vets who get little to no help over illegals?,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Scott Pennington you clearly don’t understand much about the EU.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Rod Novoa How is this a fraud?,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wayne Denny  Absolutely,Really good question..... Build the wall ❤️❤️❤️
Marilyn Carter there you go again. I rest my case.,Why do the Trump cultists always call people names? Are they 5 years old?
It will cost us American taxpayers way more money than this dang wall will cost to build!! Unbelievable!!,These Democrats are unbelievable!! They do not care about your safety!! I can hardly believe this BS they are telling and to belittle the president !! His main campaign was to secure our borders and we voted for him to do what he promised he said he would ... now the Dems want to say that , that is not what the American people want? WHAT?  Are you kidding me .... we would only want Legal immigrants to this country not ones who think they can just push and free load off us and expect us to change our laws.  Do you taxpayers want to pay for these illegals . The healthcare and housing , food etc that we would have to supply to them gives them handout that we Americans don’t even get!!  You either come her legally or stay out !!   BUILD THE WALL
Jeanie Railsback sorry about your husband but if he was an illegal he wouldn’t have to have insurance and his health care would be free in California!,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak it’s the Democrats that are holding the employees of the government for ransom! President Trump is trying to negotiate while Democrats do nothing! They are the bullies!! The president is trying to protect our great nation!! I stand behind the President #Buildthewall #Trump2020,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Gary Kane Troll,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston Another Troll,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Alberto Weisz you can’t take your door down but not because of illegal immigrants because of American citizens,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Dante Noel   A liberal loon not supporting this "POLICY!"  Perhaps you should have studied something that would have given you a career and at the same time taught you how to properly construct a sentence!   Perhaps you could move to the Hague and sit on the UN's International Court of Justice!!! You know, the Court that caters to dictatorships and terrorist regimes, while degrading and finding fault with  democracies, especially Israel and the United States!!!  I'm sure you'd fit right in!!!!,America first! Trump 2020!
Chris Weiss   You Fool!!!!  You may know the skin color because that's the first thing LIBERALS notice! But you have no IDEA whether they were Christian or not!!! Of course, unless you're writing a book and have researched and talked to the families, friends, churches they've attended, basically gathering evidence, facts, quotes from family members, friends, pastors of the churches these White males attended in order to write a book dealing with the mass shootings that occurred in 2017!!!   I know you're not a writer! I know you haven't researched this claim you've made of their religious background!  So why don't you SHUT UP and quit using this asinine claim to bash CHRISTIANITY!!  We have enough of that going on in our country today!!!!!,Every mass shooting in 2017 was carried out by American born Christian males!
Dan Griffin   Neither do I!!!  It's facts versus feelings!!!!,You will notice on these threads that conservatives engage in logic based, constructive dialogue, while most of the emotion, and misinformation comes from the left? What does this say about the people being voted in by the dems? I just don't meet very many smart liberals out here in the real world
Silvia Serra Lobo   You need to understand what Danny means by the EU destroying his culture!!!  It's what President Trump and us Trump supporters want to stop from happening here!!!!   FACT CHECK THAT!!!!!,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Justin Fields   Sorry, Justin!!!   PRESIDENT TRUMP, THANK YOU FOR PUTTING AMERICA FIRST ON EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE!!!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,Best president ever! #maga
Worley Michael   Haven't you heard???  Russian collusion and the Trump campaign, ZILCH, ZERO, NADA, NOTHING!!!! NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION!!!!

Sarah Knutson finally have a president that cares about the security of the American people.  Democrats are a disgrace to this country!,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Cindy Cripps-Prawak your a jack ass.  He’s the only one working on deals they say know.  Clump Out of the rock your under.  It’s pelosi fault. Taking vacations. Not trump. And we need a wall.  I’m American.  And I want to hear English in my country. I’m sick of no hablo English.  Learn our language,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Diane Ohlzen You are entitled to your opinion as I am to mine. Shall we just agree to disagree?,Terry Tarver I so agree!!!
Norene Boone Give the federal people back their pay. Instead hold all of Senators and Reps, they are the ones that are holding up the pay of USA Citizens.

Terry Tarver I so agree!!!,Todd Schroeder shame on you
Dave Callender When it becomes illegal to be named "Ann" fine but it isn't. However, have you gone to our federal immigration site? It is ILLEGAL TO ENTER HERE WITHOUT GOING THRU THE IMMIGRANTION PROCESS. You liberals just like to pick and choose what laws you want people to obey. Plus you have no problem murdering unborn humans!,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Dave David Let's get rid of every brain dead liberal, starting with you!,Get rid of the white male gun toting Christians and we’ll all be much safer.
That's because he wasn't a pregnant illegal alien. They can get free Medicaid along with their anchor babies!,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.
Bill Miller Your fake account has reported coward scum! Don’t you FAKE accounts realize you’re just helping our side unite even further? Ha, thanks!!,Man you fake trolls are out there in full force but you are not the voice of the people, you are scum cowards hiding behind phony accounts! How’s the weather in Russia or is it China or in your Mom’s basement? Build the wall! BTW, your irreverent comments just unifies us even more and makes us stronger so knock yourselves out!
Austin Wheeler I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.,What about all the civilians, that were born here, killing each other?   There’s larger issues than what you bring to the table don.
Bill Hoeler  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.,More Americans are killed by Americans than come over the boarder
Dave Sienknecht really, over 1100 came through an open area the other day.  That's one day.  Over 52,000 captured in December,  and those are the ones they caught.  Thousands more are in our country.  Illegal aliens come through open borders, and that is a fact.,The question is, would a wall have stopped this guy from coming here? No, because the vast majority come across ports of entry, not the desert.
Emily Neal I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.

You must have skipped government classes.,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.

Larry Martin our farmers love Trump!  I'm farm community here!,We support you and fully agree with you!!! Build that wall because Congress and the Democrats don't know how the rest of us live and go through. The rest of us don't have a security detail or the money to invest in high quality security systems.

While 3 people in my community were killed by natural born citizens. But I only care about what directly affects me. So let's focus on the immigrant".  Conservative logic behind the wall. 🤔
Kerry Gay this family spoke about needing a wall.  So, he isn't using anyone.  You're very ignorant.  The cities who have the strictest gun control has the highest gun violence.  Crime in your state is up to your state, this is a federal government problem of protecting its borders. Please, try researching before speaking, because you definitely are ignorant in many areas, and ignorance is unbecoming!,Following this logic, shouldn’t you be focusing on common sense gun laws, affordable healthcare for all including prescription medications,  the opioid crisis, and livable wages for all? The family you’re using to politicize this issue have suffered an unspeakable and horrific tragedy - just like all of the families in the mass shootings have along with all of the families that lost loved ones due to being priced out of medical treatment.
Krista Meyer they do put out warnings, at least in Ohio.  I post many of them in my crime group.,As we protect our country from people entering illegally,could we also raise the danger level of Mexico?   Our son was murdered there on vacation 3 months  ago.  The murder statistics are outrageous.   Statistics are higher each year.  There were 30,000 murders there in 2017 and 17,000 in US.  Mexico is 1/3 the size of US.   We need to investigate murders of our citizens in Mexico!
Laura Anglin Peterson  I'm so sick of liberal stupidity.  Crime is a state issue.  This is a federal issue since it has to do with illegal immigration.   Stop voting Democrat, and your state will fair better.  Also, go back to school and educate yourself on state and federal issues.  You must have skipped government classes.  You can't use national security crises on guns, because it's a protected right in the Constitution.   Obama used national emergency for Obamacare, and the courts said its unconstitutional.   Quit feeding your mind with liberal poison.,Yes, Protect all Americans!! 5 killed yesterday from US citizen. The national emergency is gun control and affordable healthcare!! Not wasting money on a wall, Years in the courts!!
Lisa Mann no, it will be difficult to go over, and it will have cement footers.  Since you will be able to see through it, border patrol will see digging or other things that could show other avenues around the wall.  The slats make it difficult to go through.  So, with other things that Trump asked for, like more agents and technology (which was in his package they denied, and then passed with 1.4 billion for a wall) the wall will slow down any potential illegals.  If by chance they could make it across, they will be apprehended immediately,  which doesn't happen now in areas without barriers.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Maureen Hersey Brown I can't believe the lack of compassion and empathy by these liberals.  They say, "who cares?!"  Wow!  And, the other lame garbage they put up is so mental.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Mike Mandel that was in his initial package that Nancy said no to.  Geeze, dont you people ever pay attention?,I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.
Buck Strunk no body wants open borders. Not even Democrats.,No other country has open borders why should we

Marie Garcia the dems need to fund the wall!,Please open the government. My husband has been protecting the public from dangerous inmates and   is working for free. We have two children that we need to feed and provide shelter to! Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak it is the demoncrats that are keeping the government shut down. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS FUND THE WALL TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE!,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited

Kevin Couture the wall will stop caravans of illegals from walking across the border. You think,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Josh Gr Russia is hoax perpetrated by the far left and fueled by the msm,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Diane Gippetti Those came by plane, months and months earlier,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
You really need moron meds,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Laura Johnson so I guess I’m not a real American,Stay The Course, Mr. President.  Real Americans have your back.
Baron Von Brztekkenburg He's not a Russian 🤦‍♀️,Eric Wroblewski thank you
hate much ?  so sad.  We should always put Americans before illegals. We are 20 trillion in debt, come here legally,Stan Piznarski Moron, total moron!!! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=291263014920132&id=350410435343749
SO TRUE !,Sarah Knutson: But it is alright in your eyes that your leader of Canada has allowed so many Terrorist affiliated and dangerous people into your country with open arms.  A government that has stripped you of your rights to bear arms in your homes to protect yourselves.  Thankfully here in the USA, we still have our 2nd Amendment Rights to bear arms.  Tune up your own country before you try to tune up ours.
Come LEGALLY !!!,Mr.Trump u r ancisters are from Europe...u r ancisters  distroyed Red Indians  cammunity..U.S is country of Imigrates...
WHAT.... Ck GDP & Economy#'s.   How is that failing?,It's incredible to see someone fail so miserably...
dumbass,   you believe everything you're told obviously,Then maybe you shouldn’t have conspired with Putin.
LEGALLY !!!  Not all at once.,If we are a good nation we work with other nations and not shut them out
At least he cares about American citizens more than illegals !!!,Trump needs to resign. He is a disgrace to the office. He needs to stop with all the lies and be truthful to the American people.
i love USA & the President of our Country.   He did not to go through all of this crap you guys put him through bc he is wealthy yet he still does it, why ?   bc he loves our country !!!,Then u shold start telling the truth. Almost half this nation believe your lies and turning on the half of the nation. Was that your objective, to divide a nation? U certainly have done that!!!!!!!!!
dumb,What nation, Russia? You’re making Putin proud.
Norene Boone not true. But CNN will keep telling you it is.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Brent Congdon Probably any USA airport! Good luck!,Trump's Resident Troll. SAD
Trump's Resident Troll. SAD,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Jess Castrejón yeah it’s honestly sad that he’s allowing his daughters death to be used in propaganda like this.,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
Joseph Roy  it had to be Fox News 😂. Realistically tho are you stupid to the point where you believe rape will end in the us after all the illegals are gone? Will there still be innocent people getting shot by police, and more innocent people getting shot by crazy Caucasians? That walls not gonna solve all these issues in America, and I’m sorry if you’re stupid enough to believe something like that.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Chip Hauenstein agree,BUILD IT NOW...I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHERE THE MONEY HAS TO COME FROM...GET IT AND USE IT ON THE WALL!!! PEOPLE CAN COME IN THE "OLD FASHION" WAY...LEGALLY!!!
Kimberly Mansfield  there is NO gun problem, it is a people problem. People have no respect for others, authority or human life.,This is sad but shouldn't be America's main focus there was ANOTHER mass shooting yesterday done by an American! Many people killed many hurt!
Kimberly Mansfield  get rid of illegals and hey there a whole lot of extra money for mental health,This is sad but shouldn't be America's main focus there was ANOTHER mass shooting yesterday done by an American! Many people killed many hurt!
Heather Hegge,Keep on fighting, Mr. President!!
Linda Silver Trumps IQ is quite high . What's yours!?,Trump this is total Bullshit! What a Propaganda post ! We will be a Nation and "STUPID Trump" isn't gonna fly in with his tights and cape to save the day ! Trump you are so PATHETIC! Trump,your first and only priority is to open up the Government NOW, so these people can get paid ! Trump, you think that by NOT paying the Border Patrol that there won't be the cartels to swoop in with butt loads of money to tempt these people! Wow, that sounds a might bit CRAZY! There had already been CORRUPTION on the Southern Border !Trump, you are complete imbecile,pay the Coast Guard ASAP, they keep our borders "SAFE" ! If this is Not some kinda of "SiCK " game and a Political ploy to "USE" your CRAZY base,then prove it ! OPEN UP THE GOVERNMENT! I still am interested in where all the 1.6 Billion Dollars that you got in March went ? Why are you asking for an additional 5.7 Billion dollars ? Why hold these Feberal workers "Hostages" just so you can say "I won " ? It should demonstrate to the American people that you don't "Care" about the citizens of this Nation and that you are a "Greedy ,INCOMPETENT,EGOTISTICAL,,LIAR "! Trump your tweet about Schumer is very PATHETIC,you Fired Comey because of the "Russia Thing"! What Trump are you grasping at straws? Trump ,you could go today and TESTIFY to Mueller Face to Face and put it all behind you ,since all of this is just more Distraction from the Meuller investigation! Dude,you still have the option to RESIGN before you are in PRISON! Why don't you just to that,save the country money and time in your IMPEACHMENT hearings !

He is sucking people in like you.,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.

,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Joani Pakula you are a fool believing what Trump said.,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Joani Pakula you should provide some data which demonstrates that there is a security crisis at our southern border. After you realize that the evidence doesn't support that crisis rhetoric,  you should think critically about the true nature of this demand for a wall (campaign gimmick) and the fact that there was bipartisan legislation passed by the Republican Congress that Trump refused to sign - after he said he would,  which shut down the government.    Is it rational to support and believe a well known liar?  Is it rational to blame Democrats for a shutdown that Trump promised if he didn't get what he wanted?,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.

Is it because you lied and are now trying to stick American tax payers with the $25 billion dollar wall. Your stupid wall idea only covers a small percentage of the country and does absolutely nothing to stop the 40% of immigrants that fly in. Your $25 billion dollar wall will do nothing to stop illegal immigration. Why dont you just be honest and admit you know how to embezel and extort a ton of money from this wall project.

Emily Neal, so you are obviously for alcohol to be completely banned, because tens of thousands Americans have been killed by people that should have not had alcohol in the first place.

Laws against drunk driving are already in place and are enforced.  Immigration laws have become relaxed and people try to protect those who come here illegally.  Big difference in how the 2 are addressed.  Did my friend deserve to die when he was walking down the sidewalk and was struck by a female illegal immigrant and thrown 50 feet through the air and spending the next 2 weeks in the hospital before he died. The driver was sober and had no insurance and because of her status as an illegal the state's DA decided not to press charges she lives a happy life in Rockford illinois while an American family weeps.  So how will you defend something like this.  Even more so when the person that killed my friend had no legal right to even be in the country that my friend fought and served for.,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
Obama? Lol,No one but this great man could withstand the abuse and the lack of support and still accomplish the unthinkable. You’re a warrior, sir. We thank you and we love you. God is with you🙏💙. In my 74 years, no one even comes close🇺🇸
Has Mexico changed their name to Democrat's? Then yeah Mexico is apparently playing haha,If Democrats are smart they would just give him the money he wants. Now that he's moved on this and the fact this is such a polarizing subject, if this trickles to the next election good luck winning.
They probably gonna call border patrol on you 😂😂,Build the WALL. BUILD the WALL.  Keep us and the country safe please. God's your guie and protector.
So you're telling me that after all the bullshit about Obama bringing Sharia Law to America, you'd be okay with Trump declaring martial law over something as pointless as a border wall?,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Yesssssss, get this over with, start prosecuting, now, killary first & all else will fall with her 😡Start peeling the corrupt onion of all time , NOW !,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp!

No it won't, if they're carting them in vehicles, they're coming in at a border point.  That would require more staff to check more vehicles.  If they are coming by sea, no wall will stop that,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Exactly,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Nor do we,No other country has open borders why should we
He needs the budget,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Lonnie McAfee but we will get that WALL,No other country has open borders why should we
Stephen DeVoy and you are so democrat,No other country has open borders why should we
Adam Smith yes, you sure as hell are not AMERICAN, STAY IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY WHEREVER THAT IS!,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
it's the demo RATS fault at this that these people are not getting paid (but eventually will get paid), dems are stupid and ignorant, we need this wall, walls work, they work in all the other countries that WE actually paid for!  I know these demo RATS got ants in their pants, but they need to let go now and work w/ our president and get this wall up now.  no more pussy footing around here you dems, you need to wise up and see what you dems are doing to this country, you are all (demo RATS) destroying our country by letting illegals thru our border and eating up our money and OUR PEOPLE are the ones that are hurting and suffering, doesn't Pelosi know many of these illegals have killed our people?  what is wrong with her?  OH, yes, she has dementia or much more a mental problem and does not know what she is doing.  what would she do if an illegal killed one of her kids (if she has any) or grandchildren or a loved one?  I guess she would just ignore it, thats her.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
What does that have to do with the illegals who commit murder in our country? Do you actually see a similarity between the 2? WOW,President Trump should invite the Covington Catholic High School students to the White House.
Nick Nevels the "now" is that illegal immigrants are a problem that needs to be solved.  It's been brought up many times by many past presidents and then ignored.  This President promised to deal with the problem and is trying to do what he promised.  Elected Democrats are doing everything they can to oppose him at every turn.  They think if this lasts long enough that people who once supported Trump will get frustrated and won't support him in the next election.  Plain and simple.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Carl Ostendarp he did take responsibility for shutting it down.  But Democrats are responsible for keeping it down for this long.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Cindy Cripps-Prawak like Obama did during the shutdown during his presidency?,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Kelly Anders hopefully you realize that not all illegal immigrants are brown.  Also, what does being gay have to do with your fear of white men?  I probably don't understand the issues you face because #1 I'm straight and #2 a person's life choices, sexuality, political affiliation, skin color, etc aren't really things I think about when I meet someone or pass them on the street.  My first impression of people is usually based on whether they are polite and pleasant or have a chip on their shoulder and a crappy attitude.  Other than that, I personally don't go throughout my daily life in fear of much.  I do believe that illegal immigration is a problem in the United States.,As a gay woman I worry more about white men than brown men
Thanks you for your sacrifice,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Nancy Pelosi doesn't care. Keep the Shutdown in force Build the wall,Terry Clark what's Hillary got to do with anything. That shipped sailed long ago. You guys need a new tune....lol
Albert Kojo Kyekye agree,Eric Wroblewski thank you
And yet the haters and hecklers remain stupid assholes. 😔,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Dave Callender   Regardles of any crimes commitef by them after they get here,It is illegal  to sneak into the country,. When an american citizens break any laws we are held accountable.  They shouldn't be an exception. They  are criminals because they brpke  the law.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Emily Neal The only way to prevent the government from becoming  too powerful is our guns. TYRANNY. Protection,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
Maybe you are on drugs ,then make sense your comment.,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don’t want this wall.
Lenny Anders yes, and it was not even read by her or the others.humm. We see the hypocrisy here daily.,Pelosi has Alcoholic Dementia, she needs to go to rehab!!!! That's a start to securing our borders.
Drew Mullen , tell that to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who don’t care about anyone but themselves! Living in their mansions behind gates with bodyguards. They have more than enough room to house illegals. Immigration laws have been in effect a long time, only the liberals have chosen to ignore them.,Exactly!

Catherine D'Amore- Piazza why are you so afraid 😱 ?  We’re you this scared before trump told you to be? Did you ever even think about a southern border wall before trump told you to?,Stay strong President Trump, no one has ever protected us like you are.... Unfortunately Nancy is more concerned about winning a battle, she has no clue what’s going on 🤦‍♀️
Debi Choate trump doesn’t care about anything but money - it is his only god- What happened to love your neighbor? There is no crisis- we do not need a wall,Terry Tarver I so agree!!!
Don Cosner I would like to add today’s lesson: On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!,Thank you President Trump! I admire you for holding your ground and keeping your promises.

Jason Terruso On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
Jim Crowell because he doesn’t care about us,You know and I  know that as soon as government workers go back to work they will get BACK PAY for all the money that is due.....Why not get the Treasury Dept to give all of the employees short term loans at no interest until the shut down is fixed....Why NOT????
John DiGaetano 🤦‍♀️the only reason trump changed his mind about signing the agreement was because Coulter yelled at him- How can you possibly believe that trump would fight for anything?,I believe that TRUMP will be the last American president who will fight as hard for America as he does, all future republican presidents will fold because of their fear of the democraps calling them names like they always do.
John R. Harvey there is no crisis- donald is lying as usual  - On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  “There is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace...

Leatha Gross why? Did you ever even think about a southern border wall before trump told you to?,We The People stand with you!
Linda Doiron Bailey oh sweetie I do believe she is third in the line of succession... Why are you so hateful?  Do you have any idea why trump didn’t get the funding for his stupid wall in the last two years when he had full control over congress?   Because they refused to fund it- so why did he wait until he lost the house- proudly proclaim on national Television that he would own the shutdown then the next day blame the Democrats?,Republican Congressmen and Republican Senators, all Republicans, need to forget Nancy and hound all the other democratic Congressmen and Senators.  Work on them and they'll do something about Nancy Pelosi.  Pelosi needs to be reminded of who it is she works for and that she is NOT the president....not even close.

Trump knows how ridiculous this wall is..he knew democrats wouldn't go for it because of how ridiculous the amount of money he wants..he knew this would happend..and he let it because he knew you guys would fall for the "this is the democrats fault" and you guys are really biting rhe bait. At least we can see people true colors now. Smh,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?

Shane Randle  but words do produce do they not? The intent with words are very powerful. GOD UTTERED WORDS AND CREATED A UNIVERSE! What have you created  today or in your life that's actually your own intellectual property?  Words are energy. They hold vibration  They hold power They hold good or bad!!! Postitive Words hold Life! Negative Words are Anti life!! Words are energy!!!🤔 Have an Awesome Day!!,You crossed the border from the spiritual realm to the physical realm!!! You did it Solo without any help from the government. You developed the awareness of thoughts and consciousness!! And because you are a divine being you have Sovereignty and Freewill and most valuable currency:Time!!! You created your own Reality!!!! No borders just space and time!!! Maybe a lesson to all who is interested in following the wealthy elite lifestyle? Its the ignorance of masses that's makes the 1 percent wealthy?
Kyle Sakamoto God had a wall build check it out it's in the bible ,keep reading you might learn more than that stupid.,Meanwhile, you clearly don't listen to the voice of thevmany faith leaders and loving Christians in the United Church of Christ, Methodists, Presbyterians, Mennonites, Quakers and others who speak out against the wall. Even some of the Amish who are informed of current events speak out against the wall. It is not Christian to build walls.
Christopher Brandon Voight then move to Mexico,I don’t want the wall!
Julia Woofter Rife call the democrats in DC and tell them it’s their fault!!,Agree need wall, but don't keep punishing the working class to get it.

Norene Boone how did that work out for Obamacare the biggest fraud on the American people? You can keep your Dr. we have to pass it to read it Pelosi!!!! Democrats are despicable people!!!!are you one too?,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Vickie Gevert because he is a hater!,I'm a huge Trump supporter but he made it appear that he had closed the deal on the wall.  Instead he comes out with this whimpy proposal lol

🤣😂🤣,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
James Novotny hate to break it to you there sparky, but it was Hillary and Obama who colluded with Russia and Iran, and it's looking more and more like agents of the UK as well to try to take down Trump. if you getting your news from CNN you got to know by now they're lying to you how much more proof do you need?,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak my God woman can't you think for yourself those are Nancy's talking points lol,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
John Howard exactly President Trump should just push through the wall and sign an executive order that fines everyone who didn't support the wall, just like Obama fined everyone who didn't sign up for his  unaffordable Care act that he shoved down our throat after shutting down the government for 17 days.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off.

Easy fix for all those in favor of making the term illegal immigration, sponsor a family into your homes no background check welcome them into your homes making it a legal immigration, so basically put your money where your mouthes are, with all the free stuff they get or drug money or human trafficking money they can pay you rent,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
Ottavio Esquivel if the wall is built Billions of tax dollars that are spent yearly will be on the decline, the ileagals get wealfare, bring in high amounts of drug dollars, work for cash and send your tax dollars in the Billions back to their country. In a big way Mexico would be paying for the wall in the way of spending less tax dollars on them,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
MJ  Stark, yes I do have a job! I have a job because of President Trump! Before all the deregulation I was unemployed for a little over a year! My last employer let 130 employees go and sent our jobs straight to Mexico. President Trump addresses everything most of us were concerned about. To top things off, my wife and I make more money than we ever have. Our standard of living has improved greatly and I am 57 years old!,Thank you President Trump! I admire you for holding your ground and keeping your promises.

Marcia Losee who are you talking to?,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.

We need protection from morons like this ^^^^^ >:(,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another

David Lovell because of so called republicans like flakey flake, mr thumbs down McCain, Corky Corker and other Democrats acting like Republicans and technically we never had the Senate it takes 60,I don't understand why we didn't vote to secure our borders when the Repubs had the majority !!
Michael Pearson Lying Trump supporter?  I am a Proud Iowa Trump Supporter who, like Ruben, does not lie.  Mike Gruenfeld, your figures are far from the truth.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

TROLL ALERT!!!,Day 719 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency) - Jesus Weeps! Mike Pence, a “man” who states he is a devoted follower of Jesus Christ LIES to his fellow Americans concerning Southern Border & defends the LIES of Donald J Trump. HE IS NOT A MAN OF GOD!   https://www.google.com/amp/s/thinkprogress.org/pence-defends-trumps-lie-presidents-dont-support-border-wall-f71c1ad56e10/amp/Pence was asked about Trump’s blatant border wall lie during interview. It didn’t go well.thinkprogress.org
TROLL ALERT!!!,Where is his taxes.
Ron O'Hearn  Whipping is cheap and effective, you can even train animals with a whip.  It's actually the way I was trained to have respect for the rules.,I believe legislation would be way more effective than a wall.  If there were no benefits, no work, no way to even move around the country and commit crimes, and there was immediate punishment (whipping) and deportation, then we wouldn't have a problem with illegals wanting to be here in the first place.
Estefania Torres Restrepo Exactly!,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Keith Vaz  Aw jealous because your not getting any!  Best President Ever! Vote Trump 2020! We the people back you 100%!,Course it is when there is no more pussy to grab.
Marley Dee  you keep telling yourself that! Trump is the best President Ever! Build that wall and secure our country! Vote Trump 2020! Do you realize Nancy is what’s wrong with our country! She wanted the wall once until Trump promised the people the wall! Now she doesn’t because she doesn’t want Trump to make good on this promise to build the Wall! Problem solved if Nancy was dismissed! She’s going to far! Government could open if she cared about the people! Hey Nancy open your doors and fence your friends are coming! OH wait your afraid of them! What a wacko! ❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️,Trump hates Powerful women.  In fact he despises them.  - Pelosi Has denied him his State of the Union Address  - Pelosi arguably has more power than he does right now  -  Pelosi will ultimately lead the Impeachment of this alleged Russian Asset  This Powerful woman Wins!
George Mendes  lol all you proved with that made up list , is that you know the months of the year in order! Lol Good for you! I have a gold star sticker for you!!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Vince Belardino you aren't really going to wait for little Miss Wendy to message you with facts, are you! 😄,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Teresa Pagniano where did he get his first dose?,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.
Patrick Dixon they arent running here from Tijuana 😂,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
oh, it's there..Joan..the love for our president..from all the people who want to live in freedom...that is a vast majority of the citizens..!,Note your poll numbers are tanking and even suburban white men show an 18% drop in approval....You make all this love for you up so you feel OK about yourself....It isn’t working...
hope you are talking to Nancy, because she is the one keeping the gov't closed..she will not negotiate in any way...stays hidden or on vacation..the president is ready to listen to whatever she purposes...,Terry Clark what's Hillary got to do with anything. That shipped sailed long ago. You guys need a new tune....lol
Paul Nix So agree!,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dave Mosley Jr. And he did at first but now at this point the continued shutdown is 100% because of Dems.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Roy Meston then every President in the last 40 years has been weak.  Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Obama all shut it down.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Mike Donovan remove them from being gun free zones & they will be much safer.,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Norene Boone except Obama shutdown the government until Obamacare was passed.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Vicki Zamow good was the best thank god,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Carolyn Alexander she thinks she’s better than everybody else,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
https://www.facebook.com/realCharlieKirk/videos/388989571873719/,Pelosi, Schumer and other Democrats #1 goal is to obstruct, indict and impeach President Trump at the cost of the American people, they do NOT care about us! Democrats in powerful positions only know how to lie, cheat, steal, obstruct, spread hate/violence, corrupt, cover for each other, make everything about race, attack religion, play on our emotions, and get away with all types of crimes on their way to getting what they want. They support open borders and abortion. They are NOT above the law even though they think they are untouchable. Progressives/Socialists/Communists ALL think the same, just at different levels of insanity.
Andrew Webster House has approved budgets, the Senate has the authority to approve the budget as well - they just won't without trump's "permission" (which is not how it works BTW) Trump is holding our citizen's pay hostage while you act like a butthurt child.,Say's the man who won't pay 800,000 of his government employees
Eddie Almeyda my act of kindness today is not to respond to your misunderstanding.,Thank you for speaking out. Prayers of peace for you and your family.
actually I think there is only one brain cell left.,Small hands. Small brain.
Emil Dörr no message received???,Go,go Don, build that wall mate. Wish we could in the UK.

Georgia Wass haha. So you’re such an expert, how much more is the right number😂,Georgia Wass my career was in healthcare. $5.6B doesn’t touch what is invested in healthcare. You just like to hear yourself talk.

Buck Strunk we don't Buck! Quit listening to the liars saying we do.,No other country has open borders why should we
Dump. Ass,Democrats and Republicans have passed funding for border security. You want only your nonsensical campaign promise version. And today, you Tweet that you never meant for Mexico to literally pay for it? You are a very bad joke. Not laughing.
No other country has guns either and they have socialist healthcare. You still think "other countries" is the example you want to use?,Rod Novoa so is your portfolio

Cynthia Hill says a lot that you think not cheating on your spouse is "living on a pedestal",As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂
Wow the lengths these people go. I'm legit sorry for your husbands,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂
Cynthia Hill yes we can certainly cast the first stone.  We have never cheated on our spouses, so yea.  Maybe it's not the case with you so you find it surprising, but a lot of us live our lives with honesty. You're sounding very suspicious at this point though,  trying to normalize adulterous behavior and all,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂
Let's see your husbands cheat on you,  then turn around and say "well you're not perfect either". Lol let's see how much sense that makes then,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂
Lol these people:  "Cheating on your wife is bad and says a lot about your character" isn't a statement that requires a perfect person to acknowledge, just a *moral* person to acknowledge,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂
So how many friends *do* you have that are cheating on their spouses Elisabeth Temple?,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂

That white kid in TX that killed a whole family didnt even get any jail time because of his privilege. But u wanna use this as a platform for billions of dollars for a wall??? GTFOH!
Thaddeus Mountain yep we know:), yet democrats are keeping it shutdown for not taking the security and safety of the American people seriously.,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage

Carrie Stewart careful You might offend it,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage
Diana Morris not having the FDA protecting food, TSA quitting and an unpaid Coast Guard protects our country how ?,Exactly! The role of government is to protect its people!
Kristen Schmitz put it on his Deplorable supporters and Republican in Congress.,The borders ARE secure. We spend billions every year to make sure of that. Good luck with that.
Paul Hogan National Parks are trash heeps, TSA agents quit, government employees on SNAP.  What a disgrace!,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!

Anne Miller GFY troll no friends on its fakebook page STFU troll,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Craig Mace Is that all you have really StFU already you sound so fricking ignorant,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down.

Hope Lester Weston You really think those four CBP agent Trump put in front of a microphone speak for the entire CBP? They don’t.,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Sources?,The KKK kills people everyday.   Where's the wall
You're missing the point. Its called a deterent. It will make them have no choice but to use those methods and will likely be shot down or sunk if so.  Why do you have locks on your doors at home if someone can just ram a car through it or break in a window? Thats your logic,Nikki Graham How do you know this? Did you read the bill? Who is your source?
I can see why you arent a politician,By that logic, an illegal immigrant saved my life. We need to tear down any type of border.
Roberta Hayes apparently it works for Democrats.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Kevin Peevey that's not how any of this works 😂😂😂,The wall will fix drinking and driving?.........
Kevin Peevey 😂 no... that won't stop natural US citizens from drinking and driving and causing fatal accidents... it's only a news story because he was an illegal immigrant... if it was a white guy it would have been a completely normal occurrence 😄,The wall will fix drinking and driving?.........
Amedeo Corey make it easier? My god you're an idiot,you mean a wall?
The overwhelming majority come in legally, overstaying visas, and through legal ports of entry other then Mexico.  A wall would prevent none of that - proper legislation, which lobbyists to both sides oppose, would.,20% of illegal immigration comes in through Mexico, and a wall won't stop half of that.  Logical legislation is need, not a stupid wall.
I am Canadian he is a great President and you should all proud of him!,Ron Wissler Now that’s intelligent ..
Arturo Rosales I don't know if it does or not but I do know this is what you sound and look like when you stop your TDS treatments! https://youtu.be/wDYNVH0U3cs,Do they also work for mass shootings???? 🤔🤔🤔
Brent Robinson I think alot of Dems will be changing their party for 2020 after this BULLSHIT!,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp!

Christopher John I got it! Some don't get humor Christopher?,This is not ok. If President Obama has said this, it would be Ok.....but not you President Trump. Nothing is Ok if it come out of your mouth. The media and the liberal socialist in this country I’ll make sure of itz
Cindy Cripps-Prawak Shameless is what Dems are?,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited

Gary Kane Snowflakes melting on a Trump fireeeeee,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
George Brakey They can't compete with what he's done in alittle over 2 years with jobs,Korea,taxes oil production lowest unemployment! All Dems can do is try to stop him from winning at his promise of border security  as a win for themselves!,When are the Democrats going to wake up and back Trump. Build the Wall.
George Brakey Why do you think that most of these mass shotters go to no gun zones such as schools and work sweetie!,When are the Democrats going to wake up and back Trump. Build the Wall.
Kim Miller  lol lol I love when you idiot say this! I do! So your cure is to take guns away from non criminals so that when criminals Illegally get a gun theLaw abiding citizens can't protect themselves! You definitely are a Dem! Lol No better then Obama care or the new universal health care that your demoRATs want to try AGAIN????,When are the Democrats going to wake up and back Trump. Build the Wall.
Joe Jimenez And a black guy killed how many yester at his job? Just trying to point out what a total idiot you truly are in life! You don't have any friends at all huh?I wonder why? Freaking loser!,....and a white person killed how many innocent people in Las Vegas...how many innocent kids got killed by a white kid while at school..how many innocent people got killed while watching a movie at a movie theater by a white person..how many people got killed while attending church services by a white person..just asking for an illegal immigrant who only comes to do a job a white person doesnt want to do..
DemoRATS are the new Anti American movement! With their Abortion till full term ,open borders, guilty till proven innocent, getting rid of the so called KKK Ice agents , Universal health care AGAIN !!!!!! Meaning let's try Obama care again????lol Illegals over Americans? I could go on and on ????,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
John Garrison TDS blinds most people of common sense is why! Example,,,who in there right mind would be against border security? Isn't it funny how all these Dems today that say a border barrier or wall is immoral voted for such barriers just a few short years ago but now are against it? Dems don't have a plan to beat Trump's accomplishments  is why there( ALL IN) on not seeing him secure our border! A loss to Trump is a win for them! It's fucking sad too because we the people get hurt in Dems quest for power back going into 2020 elections! Dems are their own worst enemy! They have also brought out the worst in AMERICANS too !,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
John Garrison I was agreeing with you idiot? Geeze?,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
Sue Carol How long have guns been around in this country Sue! People are get desensitized in this world today with death ! If they want to kill and don't have a gun they will use a car or a knife,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
Kris Landers Obviously Kris here has stopped going to her TDS treatments folks? It's not here fault!,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Kris Landers This is so you here idiot! https://youtu.be/wDYNVH0U3cs,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

Sam North Obviously we can keep out our own citizens idiot but we can keep out Illegals! Did you even read how stupid your post sounded before you posted it? Did you mom tell you as she put you on the little yellow bus every morning that it was for the smarter kids at your school Sam? Like wow?,A legal citizen shot and killed 5 Americans yesterday.
Shirley Terry Harrow She's overwhelmed with power? Did you literally see her face when they handed her the power hammer? My God? She had the most evil fucking grin I've ever seen?,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Tina Sonego Says the girl that sleeps,eats,and shits with CNN on??? The difference is sweetie that none of those were preventable!!! Illegal deaths are??? Did you take the little bus to school? Just asking???,more people died in the Vegas massacre then all this angel victims put together..let's see why dont we start a group for people who were killed from hunting accidents..people killed in church massacres from a crazy gunman..why give these people special recognition. especially since trump has been using them as his poster women for the wall
Many, one could say it's the addicts fault but I wouldn't. The facts are 90% of herion come across the southern border.,The Stable Genius was so correct when calling those who appose a wall liars. The Angel families must be heard, the 70,000 overdoses a year must be taken into account.  We must have a wall as part of Border security.
Rod Novoa go back to slobbing on knobs you're just another snowflake we don't care what you say thank you don't like it leave the country,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Arturo Elroy Mañana : The Border Agents say the walls work.  Considering that they put their lives on the line everyday, I will believe them over the liberal hypothetical opinions.,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.

Anne Tourjee how about we don't give South America 10.6 billion in aid. How about you pay 70% of your pay. You don't penalize someone for success and reward others who don't have success. Wake up,your promise was that taxpayers would not pay for the wall. We're among you to hold to your promise. Also, find a way to pay for it. Maybe a 70% tax on income over $10 million?
Anne Tourjee to ask any person to pay 70% for their success is wrong. I get it. You're ok giving South   America 10.6 billion?,your promise was that taxpayers would not pay for the wall.

You are so clueless you don't understand how government works....53 Republicans control the Senate but they need 7 Democrats to vote yes...it takes 60 votes to pass a bill to fund government and a wall.,Yvonne Webber we elected democrats to the house to stop his tyranny and impeach him. GET OVER IT!
Are you so clueless that you are not aware Trump refused to accept the $400,000 presidential salary Obama got? His salary is $1 per year to comply with the Constitution.,Dear Mr. President, since you, the senate, and the house of representatives have chosen not to work with each other I suppose that none of you  been denied you salaries in regard to the shutdown...what a surprise.  Does that mean I don't owe taxes for the weeks or months that this shutdown is in effect?  Afterall if I'm not receiving services why should I pay for it?
Keep it shut Mr. President...the millions she talked about can get a real job in the private sector....surely they are not that incompetent that only government can offer them a job?,Just please reopen the government. Millions are in need of food stamps, military retirement pay and many more of pay checks. Please mr. President
Ha Ha...thanks for the laugh....yep, all you can do is resort to name calling....you know I am right.,Just please reopen the government. Millions are in need of food stamps, military retirement pay and many more of pay checks. Please mr. President
Joe, can you please do something about the people you know who voted for Clinton / Obama? (Such as friends, family members, coworkers, neighbors, etc) Please make sure they do not screw up again and support another communist Democrat again.,How can these libtards go on national tv..and lie..they offer no facts..no numbers..none!! Then they call our president a liar.. he is inducing panic and manufacturing   fear...??? How are they allowed to just flat out lie like that to the people!!!??
Do more please....the friendly waitress at your local restaurant for example...make sure she does not vote Democrat....what about your neighbors, the mailman who comes to your home every day, etc.,How can these libtards go on national tv..and lie..they offer no facts..no numbers..none!! Then they call our president a liar.. he is inducing panic and manufacturing   fear...??? How are they allowed to just flat out lie like that to the people!!!??
The Israel wall has been very effective at keeping bad people out.,We all want security but the wall isn't going to fix anything. This isn't the Ming Dynasty. We don't have hordes of Mongols pillaging our towns. It didn't work then or now.
Just not a stupid wall!,Democrats want border security!
Buck Strunk NO ONE wants open borders doofus! Quit drinking the faux koolaid,No other country has open borders why should we
Poor little monkeys....it's all about Russia. This immigration talk is all BS, all a distraction. Morons.,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them. We see this in the recent drama from Buzzfeed. Absolutely amazing the reaction they had before they knew the truth and now after they know the truth. It’s a COMPLETE MELT DOWN.  WHAT A F——D up way to live!!!
"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor".    We currently have a potus who lies way more than he tells the truth, this is a new experience.,Last I checked, Mexican border has remained the same since the 1850s, and we've seemed to get by. Illegal border crossings have steadily declined since the 1970s.  I'm trying to understand why now we have an "emergency", or "crisis"..  I thought healthcare was a crisis, that was going to be "so easy" to fix, and was going to be fixed on your first day, what happened??  Seems the great negotiator,  you're NOT!!!   You have said many, many times over the years, that a government shutdown is the president's fault, it shows their lack of ability to negotiate.   WELL?????
Mike, if you think it takes heat stroke to tell the truth, ok.  Please prove any of my points to be wrong.

No doubt.  It shows what kind of person you are.    Do you realize how many people around Trump have been charge, indicted, and plead guilty to a plethora or crimes, many leading back to 'individual 1' ?   Do you just ignore all of that, and somehow reason it all out?,Last I checked, Mexican border has remained the same since the 1850s, and we've seemed to get by.

Curtis Rice 2020 !!!!!,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Obama had/has his own social media. Get off your high horse,OMG, how insanely ridiculous is it that a US president would create his own media network to spread his foul propaganda? Worse, how incredibly gullible and stupid do you have to be to fall for this crap? Good thing less than a third of the population is this ignorant. Still, that's too many.
John Baron you do,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Gary Kane your so liberal, so far to the left, so full of hate.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Erika:  I don't know WHERE you took such a poll as to arrive at:  "most hated president ever!!"...but, girl, are you ever so WRONG!!!  Must have been from the same source as the poll that had Killery winning the election!!  So, get out your coloring book, girl, 'cause we're putting THIS president back into office come 2020!!,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
Pelosi is only a small part of the problem, but she reflects on what the Democratic Party has become over the years.  It is now fully infiltrated and being run by socialists and communists....she is just one of its minions!!! https://patch.com/michigan/royaloak/democratic-party-has-morphed-communist-party-socialist-party-0,Pelosi has something going on mentally.

And they didn’t have time to pass legislation in TWO YEARS to secure our borders? That’s was one of his first promises.  Think about it,  TWO YEARS and nothing standing in his way.  He could have had a slam dunk, a done deal. I just don’t think it’s that important to him.,Tim Finch no the entire Party is responsible. They could have had it but they waited ( for what?) Now they have a great excuse Not to, Don’t have the votes anymore.  They are playing us.
It’s called governing and part of that is compromising for the Greater Good. The Left wanted DACA, the Right wanted the Wall.  Time for them to go to work. Listen to the other side they’re not ALL crazy and they just may have valid points. Listen to Learn not Argue.  We all want the same outcome, a safe country, why would  we not?,Tim Finch no the entire Party is responsible. They could have had it but they waited ( for what?)

Sorry about your son 😥,My son was killed by a drunk driver also. That man was from Long Island New York. Should we put a wall there too? Odds are in the years both of us lost our kids to drunk drivers the majority of them were born & raised in the USA. Does one death matter less because of the who or where they were from?  Yes laws need to be enforced all the way around but especially on the employers that hire undocumented workers.Something so many neglect to mention or enforce. Seems even Trump branded businesses like to hire the undocumented.  Not sure a wall in the middle of the desert would make much of a difference. Ports of entry, towns, cities is different.  Everyone agrees something needs to be done just some of us see the wall as a waste of money from a man that promised Mexico would pay for it. Maybe use fines imposed on businesses that use undocumented labor illegally to pay for a wall where it would be most effective.
Danny Jones I hope May makes no deal with the EU! You will prosper that way! Stay strong!,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
I could see dad tearing them a new one trying to cross 😂😂,MR President, I would be honored to serve as security for our country on the border.
Abby Schmidt  I don’t think Mexican pay for the wall ..we need to pay 😞 taxes,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!

Oh yes very proud 🤥🤥🤥,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Darla Maria Grippa-Pietrangolare  If the dems would stop obstructing the same thing they wanted before Trump was elected we could end this nonsense,Why don’t you just take the money you need for your “230 miles” of wall from all of the corrupt congressmen, senators, lobbyist, pharmaceutical companies and monopolized businesses???? I bet you could fund your wall REALLY FAST if you did that!! And I bet you’d gain some brownie points along the way with the average Americans who are suffering from this unnecessary shut down. Just saying.... 🤷🏻‍♀️ It’s time to “put your money where your mouth is”
John Baron absolutely. He said he could feel for them 😂😂😂. He never had to work I mean real work In His life , so how could he feel for them. He was a millionaire by age 8 thanks to his corrupt daddy. The whole family was and is corrupt.,Eric Wroblewski thank you

If the Russians controlled the President of the United States— what are things they would want him to do:  - shut down the U.S. Government   - ease sanctions, particularly key Putin associates   - undermine and propose pulling out of NATO  - disrupt U.S. allied relationships  - start disruptive trade wars   - discredit U.S. intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial systems   - fill the Government leadership with people who have no relevant experience, give them a mandate of dismantle and neglect, and throw in a healthy dash of graft and corruption  - pull out of Syria  - pull out of Afghanistan   - turn our back on the Ukraine   - turn our back on the Kurds   - support extreme white supremacy groups   - support Brexit and disrupt the EU  - undermine the free press  - undermine the U.S. electoral process  - destroy all records and keep secret the content of discussions from 5 in person meetings with trump since being elected   What else??,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all

Why is Lindsay Graham in Turkey? 🤔,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.

,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Betsy Hammond  Yep so many more REAL emergencies than the stupid wall. What a Con,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.

Rod Novoa  Kinda like Obama ! At least trump is doing what he promised I can’t say the same for any other president.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sharon Et Trina Bratley  American drunk drivers get let off too !,I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
Where’s the data for this? I don’t believe your statement.   Let me tell you a story. Someone wants to shoot a big bunch of kids, so they walk into a gun shop, get an semi-automatic gun straight away and goes and shoots up a school. This is the problem.   The solution: the same person wants to shoot a big bunch of kids, they go into a gun shop, background checks are required and then a waiting period. Background check finds the person with multiple mental health/violence issues and are not allowed a gun. Person can not shoot up a school and overtime thousands of lives are saved.,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
Dave Tuttle he will not get his wall, he will get money for border security.

meanwhile, climate change, election security, record National debt, the opioid epidemic, North Korea, Russia, Iran, disappearing middle-class, crumbling infrastructure, healtcare costs, etc.  just aren't as important as this wall idea.  abFUCKINGsurd.,and, Americans DON'T want an expansive border wall.  but when the POTUS chooses his favorite approval poll (Rassmusen at the time) and lies about 1% point (49% approval NOT 50%) in order to convince people he's doing great, is it any wonder that we believe that ~4,000 terrorist aliens were apprehended at the southern border when the number was ACTUALLY 6?
next he'll suggest a northern border wall because 41 were apprehended there (more than 6).  and you guessed it, next it will be a giant dome encompassing the entire US.,and, Americans DON'T want an expansive border wall.  but when the POTUS chooses his favorite approval poll (Rassmusen at the time) and lies about 1% point (49% approval NOT 50%) in order to convince people he's doing great, is it any wonder that we believe that ~4,000 terrorist aliens were apprehended at the southern border when the number was ACTUALLY 6?
How about those people being killed by citizens. Should the build a wall around the whole United States? Stupid ass pendejo!!!,Theres a system and should be to get in any country our safety/ health should be upmost at the top of the list go do it trump

Mark Smart that's not how that works.  A company leased a truck from enterprise, a rental company.  The rental company has no liability of their vehicle in the possession of a subcontractor. Unless it was negligent maintenance that caused the wreck.,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, “Daniel Zuniga” who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didn’t take responsibility because they said they didn’t contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found. Find all underground tunnels coming into the US.  #BUILDtheWALL President Trump 🇺🇸
A wall will force those seeking refuge to come through a legal port of entry,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Darrell Dunn my guns have never hurt anyone.  Not sure how my guns are an emergency?,Was that an illegal immigrant that gunned down five coworkers and wounded five police the other day? The REAL emergency in the United States - gun violence.
Trump hasnt done anything illegal or fraudulent at all. You're basically trying to overturn democracy.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kim Miller haha.....great rebuttal.  Please explain how illegal immigration helps Americans?  * crickets, crickets.  😂😂😂,Kim Miller haha.....great rebuttal.  Please explain how illegal immigration helps Americans?  * crickets, crickets.  😂😂😂
Ken Arrington same place every millionaire are moron.dont like it change the law,Where is his taxes.
Rob Novoa which rock have you been under??  Citing on a February 2017 CIS analysis that used methods of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) Camarota begins diving into the numbers — and they are jarring. “(Based on the 2017 analysis) we estimate that each crosser creates a net cost of $74,722 (taxes paid minus costs) during his or her lifetime, excluding costs for their U.S.-born children. The figures from the NAS study are in 2012 dollars; converting them to 2018 dollars would raise them to $82,191. This estimate means that for every 100,000 illegal immigrants prevented from crossing illegally, it would save taxpayers $8.2 billion over the illegal immigrants’ lifetimes,” Camarota writes. That figure, $8.2 billion, seems a lot more costly than $5 billion. But surely, there can’t possible be 100,000 illegal immigrants crossing, right? “(Border Patrol data) implies that the number of successful crossers in 2018 was between 173,731 and 203,476, which we round to 170,000 and 200,000 in this report for convenience,” Camarota adds. Based on those numbers, that $5 billion wall would only have to stop about 3 to 4 percent of illegal immigrants in the next decade to pay for itself.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tony Connelly I agree with you. Between medical issues, underinsured/uninsured people not being able to afford medication and medial attention they need and gun violence due to untreated mental illness we have a real crisis.   If we want to stop most illegal immigration we just need to start putting the people who hire them in jail. it doesn't even have to be long, it could be as short as 30 days. however this would put a concrete consequences behind hiring an illegal.,Eric Helmes  Yes, put Trump in jail for knowingly hiring illegals first.   But it’s not even an issue. Historically illegal migration ebbs and flows according to economic need.  Right now it’s in deep decline and has been due to low unemployment.  This isn’t even in the top 100 issues we should be focusing on.   But, you know, campaign promises an all.
Yeah, good luck with that 😂,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hi, Dan! https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1967719046596858&set=a.106243116077803&type=3&theater,then you are a fool
Competition is key to competitive prices and work. When the people working don't care about their quality of work, they give out what they put into their work. Would you go to Walmart for all of your primary vehicle work to be done? Sure you will get a good job here and there but when you spend more at a different shop you will definitely have much better work done.,I'm tired of illegals taking jobs from Americans for absolutely dirt cheap pay... The electrical field is hard work but people like my self are willing to work them. But we are tired of fixing their horrible work and not just bad, but dangerous work, not meeting the proper city codes...
Oh I can yes. But if we're an illegal who starts his own business and hires other illegals.... Or if you are a home owner looking for cheap labor because your don't make the most money in the the world. Then you hire a guy of Mexican decent but he speaks good English. Only to find his "work" is shabby at best and that that man is not even legally here....,I'm tired of illegals taking jobs from Americans for absolutely dirt cheap pay... The electrical field is hard work but people like my self are willing to work them.

You can't tell me other wise that illegals aren't part of the problem when I personally have experienced the issue first hand.,I'm tired of illegals taking jobs from Americans for absolutely dirt cheap pay... The electrical field is hard work but people like my self are willing to work them. But we are tired of fixing their horrible work and not just bad, but dangerous work, not meeting the proper city codes...
Angel Roy walls are built to keep people/animals inside.,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
Matt Smith Did you know that almost ALL illegals get here via Airplane? Literally NONE get through the southern border.,Actual American here. WE DO NOT WANT THE WALL.   There’s thousands of things that 5 billion could be better spend on then a half ass wall.   Also, why are there so many Non-Americans saying “Best President Ever?”...... Trumps vocal fan base is a bunch of fake accounts. Trump’s cabinet is guilty.   Real Americans value human life. This isn’t Russia
If THAT WAS TRue, Why didn’t you promise to make lying, bearing false witness, and evil propaganda illegal and unlawful.  Especially when it comes to lying to masses. That’s should be a capital offense.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/02/kerns-obama-clinton/,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Louis Scherfig 🖕,I support you... in fucking yourself!
Walter Merritt I don't remember voting on a wall. And I vote in every election. And yes I want the wall.,Trump ran on the wall. The American People didn’t vote for him. In 2018 the GOP again ran on the damn wall. Once again the American People didn’t vote for them.
Werner Evans got news for you. It doesn't matter who won the popular vote. That is not how we vote on presidents. Trump is your president.,Eric S Siegel i don't dispute he is the president russian meddling notwithstanding.I dispute arguments using incorrect facts. When he gets impeached, i'll consider him my ex-president.
Many people would cry if it was laid out that blunt and direct, but somebody probably gonna have to do it sooner or later. Wow, this is crazy..........,Common sense says ya gotta protect your perimeter just like you naturally do or wanna do at your home. Maybe need to let them know that they are straight up missing some chromosomes and don't need to be involved with making decisions in regards to security period, ya know.
Ryan Heather Sarah Eller 🤡,Sue Howie stay in New Zealand and stay out of American politics funny how foriegners want a say in our President fu
Sueli Rossi  - you can't trust the Dems, but you believe every word that comes out if 45's mouth when almost everything he says can be be easily proven to be a lie? Now that's a special kind of stupid.,Sorry. Mr. President. You shouldn’t sign the bill and accepted what the democrats wanted on immigration. U can’t trust dems. Now It’s going to get worse the southern border problems
Dianna Adams Ewen  yes I have thank you,Border emergency what a hoax
Jeff Lucier Actually I do and they make $15 an hour just I’m just saying remember how you felt when you didn’t have a job this person feels the same way,You stated Mexico 🇲🇽 was gonna pay for the wall ?! Did you forget
Jeff Lucier Furthermore why would you even say Mexico was going to pay for it when he knew they weren’t and then you’re going to layoff all your government Employees honest people who didn’t do anything wrong doesn’t make any sense to me and I’m sorry you have a difference of opinion,You stated Mexico 🇲🇽 was gonna pay for the wall ?!

Brent Gordon Occupational risk what kind of bullshit is that dude you need to go on somebody else’s post,You stated Mexico 🇲🇽 was gonna pay for the wall ?! Did you forget
In the 40 years I’ve been alive I’ve only been laid off from one job government jobs should be secure in our presidents should not be playing with people’s jobs may be Obama or Trump for some reason you’re coming on this post and trying to pick a fight I don’t know you you need to go somewhere else,You stated Mexico 🇲🇽 was gonna pay for the wall ?! Did you forget
Michael Angell 5.7B isnt the whole cost of it, and Trump's methods of justifying (the ways he says it will get paid for) are ridiculous.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Buck Strunk Vatican has the biggest wall in the world?  In what fantasy land are you seeing this?  You can walk right into St. Peter's Square, and the whole Vatican is not surrounded by a wall.  Sorry.,No other country has open borders why should we
Stan Pierce How does Israel have anything to do with anything that I said?,No other country has open borders why should we
John Hamrick Yet two things of note ... 1) illegals apprehended at the border are at the lowest point in nearly 40 years and 2) less than half of our illegals come across that border.,No other country has open borders why should we
Tonja Tyree In the interest of accuracy ... Pelosi was not in Puerto Rico.  It was members of the Hispanic Caucus.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Lois Stawitcke Obama actually had no part of the approval process.  The President has an ability to rubber stamp a no on the deal, but the approval for it comes from the CFIUS.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing.

Webster Lynn Vi I promise I will not spend a dime on it. I will personally see to that.  He promised he would have Mexico pay for it and you voted for him...you pay for it ! If you really think a wall will keep them out you are part of the problem. Mexicans are not carrying millions of drugs on their back.  They are coming in planes, car and boats. How is a freaking wall gonna stop that.  A waste of your MONEY,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
Your idiot president will not make 2020. People would rather vote for a dog than him....maybe you should do some research and you can see for yourself he is the  MOST HATED  PRESIDENT EVER! But I know that's not gonna happen because people like you only believe what they want and not FACTS.,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth

Joe Calabrese I've gone many months without pay. I have a lot of empathy for the victims of illegal immigrants. I also realize that our arguing here on Facebook won't change either of our minds, so don't bother.,Please open the government.

Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.

Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.
Of  Course we need a Wall ,We need to do everything possible to stop the Criminal element from coming into our country  ,  Right now it's very bad for our country.  Guns in the wrong hands will always be a  fact ...Are you saying Guns shouldn't, be allowed ? Americans need protection from Drugs , and , all the politicians making it a reality .. I see a Country  that is being controlled by  people like Soros , I see Our Great President Trump  trying his best to go forward with a Wall and ,security for Our America  to protect Our great Nation  .. Its time to  be proud of our country again. ( Taking  Guns from the honest man will not remove the  Guns  from the depraved  segment of society ),I feel so very hurt for you.  The Wall will lessen the chances of such  a criminal to be on our streets .. Words can not comfort  you with such pain in your heart. But a Wall will prevent this in the future ...
Jo Sechi We must have a Wall  and we Must Stop illegal immigrants from killing    Us ..,I feel so very hurt for you.  The Wall will lessen the chances of such  a criminal to be on our streets .. Words can not comfort  you with such pain in your heart. But a Wall will prevent this in the future ...

Mike Charles , another treason supporter.,So, parading victims’ families? Looking for ratings, right?   An illegal made your bed thousands of times and you were fine with that bexause you and your ilk saved $$ in wages. So GTFOH with your parade, #hypocrite.
Lee Judy you don't like to hear you get out of United States,Liar, con man, Russian asset
Linda Mckenzie yeah see how fast it changes when it's one of their family members,I guess not enough people have died from heroin or from illegals for Schumer and Pelosi. You know President Trump you have a heart and it showed tonight. You love the American people.
If all is said and done and the political arguments are passed again and again, more fluently each time, like a complicated classic dance, the Potus has the ultimate responsibility for US security: "Buck stops here". That said, a compromise is always to be advocated if both parties want that. (some guarantees for "Dreamers" in exchange for funding the Wall. That wasn't perhaps a bad idea.Like in the Agent Starling/ Hannibal Lector scene: "Quid quo pro Doctor".),No other country has open borders why should we
cnn said that "Cohen was the President's lawyer". I have to look that up if that is strictly correct. Was Cohen the lawyer of the Potus when he took Office? The word "lawyer" also seems not really correct: Cohen was in fact more of a fixer. Nobody sees him as "a learned legal mind" at all.,No other country has open borders why should we
The "Nation State" cannot be taken lightly. Main worry for Brexit and the British Government is "the falling apart of the United Kingdom". We already heard lots of Brits politicians talking about "the Scottish Nation".. "The Welsh..the Irish.. do not accept this".,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
how does it feel, Charles, to live your life being a disrespectful little punk?,Wait wasn't mexico paying for the wall?
Interesting you talk about research because you haven’t posted a link to any article. Can you post a link to the article you received these statistics?  Here is an LA Times article posted Last week saying that there isn’t a crisis at the border.   https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trump-speech-immigration-border-crisis-20190206-story.html  Also I’m not sure how the history of the country I was born in should have any say in who I am as a person? What if I judged you on the history of America? Last I checked, white people today should have no burden placed on them for the atrocities of slavery in America. Let me know since that’s what I’ve been reading.,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
James Brubaker  Okay just did, here are all the articles that showed up about BORDER AGENTS in Texas and their views on Trump’s imaginary crisis.  You resorting to insults of me and my heritage display your complete inability to participate in any informed discussion and any further attempts on my part will clearly fall on your deaf ears.

Austin Baker he’s using the death to push for his border wall which he INCLUDES in the headline.   EXCEPT a wall will do nothing for illegal immigration.

Please feel free to post the information you guys have backing up your understanding of illegal immigration.  Also I’m not sure how this has anything to do with Republicans or Democrats.

It’s easier to tell Trump to end shutdown than to stand up to Tyranny and Tyrants. Get a backbone people.

Jay Boogie Boogie Woogie Roogsky?????,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that’s where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don’t see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That’s unacceptable.  Anyway, I’m done discussing it.  If 🇷🇺 doesn’t interfere,  😉 I’m sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.

Roy Meston If you thought that then you have not been listening at all.."Our proposal is not intended to solve all of our immigration challenges. This plan solves the immediate crisis -- and it is a horrible crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis like we rarely see in our country. And it provides humanitarian relief, delivers real border security, and immediately reopens our federal government. If we are successful in this effort, then we can start the border [broader] project of remaking our immigration system for the 21st century. Once the government is open and we have made a down payment on border security, and immigration reform starts to happen, I plan to convene weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House so we can do a finished product, a great product -- a product that we can all be proud of, having to do with that elusive immigration problem."

Total BS. 40 years and politicians don't do a thing.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Beverly Hurst Smith you are either funny or stupid!  The Democrats in the Senate vowed to oppose and block anything this Administration puts forth and they had enough votes to do it!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Majestica Arlene that's the most illogical and uninformed spew I've read in days!,You want to blame immigrants 🤔💭  🚨Rally me this 🚨 what if trumps grandfather 👴 were the immigrant who killed his daughter   Is that the solution for an unnecessary wall❓❓❓  We have more shootings of backyard corn bread 🥖 American’s killing more than any other race in the United States 🇺🇸   🚨The statistics are proof🚨  You can’t blame one immigrant When last year alone you have 50-1  50-Americans  1- immigrant  Responsible for the murders of innocent people ‼️  🚨We have a Gun problem 🚨 Not an immigrant issue ‼️🤨☝🏼
SirKeenan Burgess go back where YOU belong!!,Frank Johnson, good luck with that, I don’t waste energy on y’all brainwashed Cult45 Worshippers 🤷🏿‍♂️
Roy Meston because it causes a domino effect of wage increases, also, it puts many small businesses out of business, as they often don't have much of a profit margin, their only option is to lay off workers, or incorporate jobs, which would prevent them hiring in many cases, the economy would start to tank within a short time, federal employees would probably be the first to lose their jobs, budgets would not be able to cope with such an increase!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
America doesn't have open borders either. BTW the UK doesn't have a wall. Neither do many European countries. Canada doesn't have one but they are considering because of the influx of Americans running away from America.,No other country has open borders why should we

I have heard many Democrats say "Oh Trump is a billionaire Tycoon trying to use the government to get rich"--> Sorry but Trump is not the owner of a steel factory or oil company or drug company-- this is not how I understand Trump made his mark --> instead he made his mark in the toughest real estate market in the world: NY.  Now if you ask me, Trump is trying to help the economy FOR REAL because wealthy Americans PAY THEIR RENT ON TIME! this is a win-win.  This is super easy to see.. and by the way, IF YOU DONT LIKE LIVING THERE: MOVE!,This meme pretty much says it all if you think about it.

also the new Driver License rules are kind of "Draconian" the levels of proof of residence that you have to go through or else you can't take a commercial flight or set foot on federal land.. As a US Citizen who is a direct descendant of the original founders, I can tell you that I am having to face a massive headache for the first time JUST to have a compliant ID card on my drivers license.  This is draconian and it is caused by the fact that we probably have a large double digit percentage of non-citizens roaming around within our borders.

btw : MAGA.  President Trump puts together an honest effort to cooperate and end the shut-down amid an environment of absolutely tragic immaturity and lies.. the scary thing is : time is still ticking and running out.

the law of supply and demand.  wages are a price.  scarcity of workers affects the demand (price) / (WAGE)!!!!  this hurts minorities the most.  a lot of people are aware of this.  not only that but every year public sector gives itself raises but private sector is held down by mass immigration.  This is a problem even for Democrats because ultimately, even if you tax the private sector 100% you will not be able to fund the public sector.  As it is, there is talk of removing private property and every other scheme we conquered at the dawn of America and the forces driving these motives are caused by mass migration which drives down wages via the LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND!!!!  we are screwed if we don't fix this and it really is national security.

Mollie Cox you should stfu,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Daniel Alexander Allen are you mentally defective? We have sovereign countries for a reason. Illegal alien means you are not supposed to be here and don't just get to waltz your way in here.,A drunk driver killed my friend, we must ban all alcohol. Vaccines hurt my loved one, we must ban all vaccines. A gun man killed my child we must ban all guns. See how none of these are good arguments.
Jeff Abramowitz yes they do dumb ass.,Walls don’t stop murders. Walls don’t keep illegals out. Walls don’t do anything but satisfy a mentally defective old man’s base of support and those people are screwballs and failures.
And I  glad people aren't making their money.  I am glad the social security, welfare checks and all are coming to a screeching halt.  I look forward to the rioting in the streets because the newly elected Congress would rather support illegals than do their damn jobs.,Lots of people are going without pay because of YOU!!!!!!

And not building the wall?  IF YOU DON'T BUILD THE WALL THEN YOU CLEARY DONT LOVE THE US!
Kim Miller The reason why you have a problem right now is because you got a whole lot of bad people into your country that use those weapons in a bad way.

De Bolden What privilege?,This is HORRIBLE that our President would share something like this. Smh from a drunk driving accident? Come on now...this is SO DIRTY! That white kid in TX that killed a whole family didnt even get any jail time because of his privilege. But u wanna use this as a platform for billions of dollars for a wall??? GTFOH!
Listen, Santa....,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Sam North why are people not seeing through the idiot?,How about the parents from Parkland shooting!?!?
Angela Wilson very well said.   I agree,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Jonathan Schremp  do you think it’s strange that Trump didn’t get the wall funded over the last two years when the GOP controlled all 3 branches of the government? Now that he lost the House, now it’s a crisis. Don’t you think that is strange?,God Bless you President Trump! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸

Henry Durban  you have a great day too!,God Bless you President Trump! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
Brent...you're correct..I agree with you.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Anthony Clark they send billions to other countries, I believe they should do more here but, it does not mean we shouldn’t have a wall!,Why isn’t mexico paying for it? 😂😂😂 damn y’all dumb 😂😂

For the love of God we don't have it open border! We have security we had the lowest illegal immigration of all time! The wall is useless as it was a selling point for the simple-minded! And that's the reason why he is sticking with it because if he does not make this happen even the simple-minded won't back him!,No other country has open borders why should we

Bill Ajello, you certainly do not reflect any Christian values yourself.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Stan Piznarski, not every American loves Trump and I believe that there are more who dislike him. Trump doesn't care about building America, all he wants to do is build a wall. In the meantime my nighborhood is being ransacked by dangerous criminals who are actually legal American citizens. None of us are really safe and especially our schools. Our factories are not coming(roaring)back, many have moved to Mexico. Imagine that! No, not every American loves Trump and he is the one who is impossible, especially his promises which he cannot keep.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Yadira Bornacelli, aren't you being exclusively discrimnatory?  What is an American? And so if I don't agree with Trump I'm not an American or I'm actually a communist? So we all must think like you and believe what you believe, or else?,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Yadira Bornacelli, so if I think differently than you, I'm a Liberal, or if I'm not a follower of Trump, I'm liberal. Is it either your way or nothing at all? Until the mid election didn't the Republicans have control. Your semantics lack genuine truth and reasoning.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Return fire.,How do you compromise with someone that is taking shots at you?
Americans buy the drugs. Who is the problem? Lol,What about the Americans killing Americans? Never mention anything about that!! 🤔🤔🤔
Luke Wade, killing and beheading teachers?  In Mexico?  Are you sure you aren’t confusing Mexico with Afghanistan?  Even if it was actually Mexico that you speak of, its a Mexican problem.  Not ours.    I don’t care if 333,000 people are “rushing” to change citizenship when Canadians are the greater share of illegal immigrants.    I’ve also never met a lazy Mexican.  On top of the fact that I thought they were “stealing our jobs”,  or was that a lie?  You can’t have it both ways.  They cannot both be stealing our jobs and simultaneously refusing to work.  They do jobs that you or I would only do as a last-ditch effort to stave if homelessness at best.    They also DO pay taxes!  Just not federal income taxes.  They pay sales taxes on everything they buy.  Where’s the outrage over major employers choosing to knowingly employ these people anyway?  There is a creation of an attractive nuisanice in ignoring that kind of illegal employment.  But, again, why waste that kind of money on a wall that won’t stop drugs or gangs?  Especially when we are facing a record budget deficit.,This is the Netherlands and Belgium border.  I don’t see any wall, built during a time of record budget deficit. They are still very much independent nations.  https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Baarle-Nassau_frontière_café.jpg#mw-jump-to-licenseFile:Baarle-Nassau frontière café.jpg - Wikimedia Commonscommons.wikimedia.org
Vicki Zamow like ........,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Costing us $3.2 Billion,What the Government should learn from this shutdown is that people “do not” have 6 months savings for an emergency!  That needs to be addressed!!
Ruben Radar Rodriguez, thank you for your sacrifice!,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Dear Trumpanzees,  Please don't conflate hate with patriotism.,"Ego is an anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."  Booker T. Washington.
Open your eyes and minds to this traitorous blow hard who has betrayed his country and the office of the President.  God has nothing to do with this lying , manipulative drone of Vladimir Putin!,"Ego is an anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."  Booker T. Washington.
Boris Nikolayev Well said comrade!  😵,"Ego is an anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."  Booker T. Washington.
Boris Nikolayev:  Do your work for the GRU?,"Ego is an anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."  Booker T. Washington.
Dan Barrios:  News flash!  Obama is no longer president.  🤪,"Ego is an anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."  Booker T. Washington.
Phyllis Haberkamp:  As it concerns hate wagons:  "Patriotism means to stand by the country. I does not mean to stand by the president."   Theodore Roosevelt.   We've had an immigration problem for decades.  It has been ongoing since before Reagan pardoned all illegals during his administration.  One is naïve to think that building an ineffective wall across our southern border will be a solution to a long festering problem.  Are you able to recognize when your being played?,"Ego is an anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."  Booker T. Washington.
Yes genius,. continue to love and pray for your blasphemous, unwitting, inept bungling goofus as he single handedly dismantles the organizations that have protected the free world from aggression since 1945.  Hooray for his restocking the swamp with anti environmentalists sucked up from the bowels of corporate America.  Most importantly thank the Buffoon and Chief for attempting to create a space force that already exists and finally, for attempting to build a wall constructed from hate and unmitigated bullshit on our southern border.😵,We know role of any real man and leader is to protect family, community and country.  We love you..❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸❤❤
Eva Graham bella fucking Pelosi,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.

Lillian Weisberg Conway: Sarah Sanders made 'unfortunate misstatement' about terror suspects at border  ￼BY BRETT SAMUELSTWEET SHARE EMAIL  White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday downplayed the Trump administration's misrepresentation of the number of suspected terrorists apprehended at the southern border, arguing press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made "an unfortunate misstatement" a day earlier. Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked Conway if the White House's inability to get its facts right on immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border hurts its credibility after Sanders said on "Fox News Sunday" that "nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border." Anchor Chris Wallace challenged Sanders on her comments, noting that the State Department had said there haven't been any terrorists found coming across the border and that most were captured at airports. Conway on Monday acknowledged that most of the nearly 4,000 terrorists apprehended in fiscal 2017 were found at airports, citing a report from the Department of Homeland Security.  "It got unfortunately conflated by a colleague," she said. Ingraham went on to criticize the media for "cherry-picking" statistics and argued that "we all kind of make mistakes." "That was an unfortunate misstatement and everybody makes mistakes, all of us," Conway said. "The fact is, it's corrected here and anybody who turns a blind eye to the actual numbers of human trafficking, the increase in the drugs, we are concerned about your children here in the United States not being subject to all these drugs and we're concerned about their children."  Trump administration officials, including the president and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, have in recent months stated that thousands of terrorists attempt to enter the country, but have generally not elaborated on where those individuals are apprehended. NBC News on Monday obtained data showing that, in the first half of 2018, Customs and Border Protection stopped a total of six immigrants at the southern border who are now in the terrorism database. President Trump is set to deliver a prime-time address on Tuesday discussing the situation at the border, which he has referred to a crisis. The president has pushed for more than $5 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border, which has precipitated a partial government shutdown that has lasted 18 days and counting.,Eric Wroblewski thank you

rising share of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade. About two-thirds (66%) of unauthorized immigrant adults in 2016 had been in the U.S. more than 10 years, compared with 41% in 2007. A declining share of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. for less than five years – 18% of adults in 2016, compared with 30% in 2007. In 2016, unauthorized immigrant adults had lived in the U.S. for a median of 14.8 years, meaning that half had been in the country at least that long.

Curtis Rice Your stats are fake. We have the worst gangs from central America now because we are to free with our immigration polices.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Lisa Mann No all the surveillance won't be as effective. And no they won't find a way to get over or under with the right wall. Ex.. Isreal has a wall that is 99.9% effective. We need that.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Why not put the army at the bordee that money can be spend much better or wiser,What is justified doesnt need to be justified....

Tim Masters he didn’t veto it.  Yesterday you said it shouldn’t be an emergency order.  Now the government will spend millions more in court fights.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.
Tim Masters or the Dems could have approved barrier $ like they did for all previous presidents.  All politics.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.
Tim Masters right and Congress over the years handing power to the executive branch is the problem too.  They have to take back what they got lazy about and handed off.  Executive branch can now create laws and regulations all on their own in different departments,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.

Doug Reiselt Um or you could save heaps of lives (real ones, not hypothetical ones) by investing the money in something useful, like healthcare.,Georgia Wass my career was in healthcare. $5.6B doesn’t touch what is invested in healthcare. You just like to hear yourself talk.
Doug Reiselt Did I say it 'touched it'? Not exactly relevant is it. You surely can't be saying that the current expenditure is the absolute perfect maximum required.,Georgia Wass my career was in healthcare. $5.6B doesn’t touch what is invested in healthcare. You just like to hear yourself talk.
This conversation is going nowhere. Let me know when you can comment without including an insult 👋,Georgia Wass my career was in healthcare. $5.6B doesn’t touch what is invested in healthcare. You just like to hear yourself talk.
Diana Acosta ABSOLUTELY....THE WALL IS NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION....PEOPLE WILL ESCAPE INTO US WHEN THEY REALLY WANT TO,..SECURE BORDERS..,PERIOD!!!!,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don’t support it. Don’t say we.
Elizabeth Navarrete Ponte then you and the 22,7% of the voters that's left of the people who still want the wall can start emptying your piggy banks and pay for it yourselves So that means from the 135.7M voters just 30.8M people still want the wall... if you all collect 185 each then you can start building the wall... for now, but in the coming years you must pay that again because the wall is going to cost more than 50B + maintainance,Edward Odine well we’ll
Empathy is not your greatest gift eh ? Just like Trump. Apparently you've got as many brain cells as you've got pesos.,Trump is a POOR negotiator.  He tweets responses to tv host Ann Coulter over her criticism of him. He’s terrified of her .  Trump is a WIMP.   Trump works for Ann Coulter.  Not the American people.  Trump chooses to use the financial hardship of 800,000 Federal workers as PAWNS.   It’s like negotiating with a gun to their heads.
Victoria A. Deobald help us do what?,We want security, but no new wall
You can call it whatever you want. We need  border security.  The left does not care about it citizens they only want power. They can give money toward this as they waste billions on other things that is good for them,President Trump: Please end the government shutdown.  I'm for better border security but does it have to be a Wall?
William Bush Trump Train 🚂 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Logan Jeffers What “empty” campaign promise? Trump is trying to fulfill a very important campaign promise, probably THE most important promise of his campaign, but the Dems are trying to thwart his efforts. Why? Not because they don’t believe in it, but because he is Trump. Period!,Mike Hine there was bipartisan support to open the government, and Donald denied it because it wasn't the right number for him. You know my views about Donald more than probably anyone else Mike.
Curtis Rice are you trying toget an award for the dumbest post of the day?,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.

Shawn Caulder they are both the same thing in principle. the government functions like the rules of a household on a bigger scale. people who live in a home are governed by those rules, and walls of a home are meant to allow authorized people to enter just as the walls of a country are meant to only allow authorized people to enter. its interesting how you do not seem to be able to internalize such an easily understood idea,do people live in houses without walls? lol, nope. so, why should the collective home of every american not have them?
yes there should be a southern and northern border by 2030,do people live in houses without walls? lol, nope. so, why should the collective home of every american not have them?
Allen,  was not talking to you... you're no hero... quit trying to pretend you are, you're gutless like your orange hero.....pathetic.,No spelling mistakes, couple big words......who typed this for you  Donald you douche?
How many money do you need to build the wall lady??   😂🤣,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Yes, and why do US citizens have to pay for passports to visit OTHER countries, but Democrats allow and welcome anyone to cross the border regardless. Insane.,No other country has open borders why should we
Climate change? On what do you base your fears on? Al Gore’s so called Science? The same science that can’t predict what the weather is going to be tomorrow? Or the same science that doesn’t acknowledge humans begin life at conception?,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
Stewart Schaniel guns are not being taken away just laws to make sure they are in the right hands. Because remember guns do not kill people but people kill people. We need mental health checks, and training and awareness. These are the laws that need to be in place. It is called common sense gun laws.,So do guns but the government is slowly taking them away.
It should all be a concern.,38 er cent approval rating.

And I am not your comrade or your friend, in fact you are part of the evil trying to turn our country into a communist state.,It's us against those that hate America, build the wall and to Hell with the democrats.
Yes you bet I am, it's the only thing standing in the way of tyrants and idiots like you that think they have a right to the services and wages of others.,It's us against those that hate America, build the wall and to Hell with the democrats.
Kevin, you're just plain ignorant.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
And who are you?,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Buck Strunk totally agree. Trump however urged his base to vote for him in the simplest terms: rapists and murderers are coming across the border—vote for me, I’ll build a big wall. Try and get some perspective. 30,000 Americans are injured or killed by gun violence committed by other Americans in this country every year. A $20,000,000,000 wall will not protect you from people who want to pick fruit and vegetables.,No other country has open borders why should we
Sebastian Rodriguez  I agree and have said that all along - pelosi and schumer would rather ruin the country......,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Brent Congdon again I'm not against the wall, just think there are numberous other ways to pay for it. Instead of being a"whiner" all the time.,Not opposed to building the wall but part of your promise was that Mexico would pay for it. Who will pay for it?? Us the poor. And if this shutdown continues it only hurts the poor more and more. I'm on the fence with this since you Mr. President have changed your game and plans so many times.
Brent Congdon if the shutdown continues it could mean no wic programs for babies, no paychecks for the real disabled folks, no I.R.S. checks that I paid into the system all year, and possibly eventually could affect social security checks just to name a few. And most folks on social security are on fixed incomes.,Not opposed to building the wall but part of your promise was that Mexico would pay for it. Who will pay for it?? Us the poor. And if this shutdown continues it only hurts the poor more and more. I'm on the fence with this since you Mr. President have changed your game and plans so many times.

Bill Miller Trump legally can build a wall all you have to do is declare martial law or a state of emergency and he is in charge of the defense department he is the commander and chief of all military branches in the United States. The money you ask he already has for the defense department from Congress last year. So he legally has the authority to build the wall without Congress.,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Ruth Mosley actually President Trump has the legal authority to build the wall all he hase  to do is to clear a state of emergency. Which he does not need Congress for and use the money from the defense department who do you think is in charge of the United States defense department? the president of the United States is the Commander in Chief of all our Armed Forces he already has the money in for the National Defense from last year. So legally he doesn't even need the Democratic party or congress once he declares martial law in a state of emergency down at the border which he legally can because it is a threat to all Americans the military will build the wall.,Executive order. Just do it Mr President

Learie Jordan The opiate problem in this country was caused by our own drug companies, it's the reason for the demand for heroin. I have no problem with people owning guns, it's the perversion of the laws by the NRA lobby that prevent common sense guns laws that would help keep guns out of the hands of people that should not own them. This emergency declared by the idiot in chief is a manufactured lie. Someone show me that statistics that say that illegal immigrants kill more people than assholes with guns, over 300 mass shootings already this year. WTF! Moe-rons!,How about all the daughters killed by Americans with guns, people that shouldn't have guns, what about that moeron?

If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
How true.  But with the exception of the Legislation.  The rest of it is happening.  Its just a post to help people see a broader picture.,***Legislate clear Comprehensive Immigration and Naturalization Reform.*** Close Sanctuary districts and municipalities. *** Fully fund ICE..*** Prosecute Visa Overstays, *** Finish the Fence where it is needed. .
Greg Pyles if you put value on American lives you would actually know that gun control is your biggest issue.   You get out of the country.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Obamacare did NOT pass like that .https://www.dailysignal.com/2010/03/16/obamacare-slaughter-rule-is-without-precedent/,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Todd Schroeder It's amusing when a dickhead calls someone a dickhead...,Victoria A. Deobald how you know this
Another troll,So many of us are with you.  Two more caravans are coming.  Declare an emergency and get it done.  Lets the courts battle it out.

Neither do we. Just because he says it doesn't make it true.,No other country has open borders why should we
Joel Bernardini, who freaking cares! I could care less if he looked like Chris Christy or weighed 90 lbs. What I care about is agenda and that we have a stronger economy! So, please go ahead and attack MY cognitive dissonance! 🙄,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Yes, that is the biggest concern in America today! 🙄 #liberalthoughtprocess,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Stupid lol....,No other country has open borders why should we
Putting our country first????,I feel so sad that you Mr. President have to take so much from the CORRUPT and EVIL Dems, but I THANK YOU for Putting Our Country FIRST !!!!
Albert Kojo Kyekye you can have his ass!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Rodney Martin because that is basically like taking 5 BILLION dollars and catching it on fire. We have homeless vets, hungry children, crumbling infrastructure.....this is not a time to waste that kind of money. Also, I appreciate you having a civil conversation about it with me. I enjoy speaking with adults who act like adults.,Wayne Denny absolutely
Rodney Martin we are not against better than we currently have. Walls are proven not to work, it's a fact, it would be a waste of billions of dollars then we would still have to enact other saftey precautions later. No need to waste that money! We have and will give funds to basically any other form of border security.....just not a giant wasteful ineffective wall.  I have been a democrat all my adult life and have only met ONE democrat who actually wanted open borders. To say we want open borders is false and used to create division and fear.,Wayne Denny absolutely
Etta Ejg Moss then why didn't he do it at any point over the last two YEARS when Republicans had FULL control?,Wayne Denny absolutely
Jason Gardner would you like to answer the question then? Why wasn't it don't while Republicans had control of literally EVERYTHING? Why wait to fight Dems over it and shutdown the government?,Wayne Denny absolutely
Jill Travassos I am a 38 year old woman with two kids AND a mortgage so maybe get your facts together before you open your mouth.,Wayne Denny absolutely
Michelle Breen then why didn't it happen when Republicans had full control?  Why wait until Dems take over KNOWING we aren't going to sign off on wasting 5 BILLION dollars on a ineffective wall?  Please explain,Wayne Denny absolutely
Republicans could have passed it the first week Trump took office......or anytime over the past two years without needing Dem support.,Wayne Denny absolutely
Wayne Denny absolutely,Wayne Denny absolutely
Ummm....I don't think drywall is going to keep out "the brownies".,If I was Trump I'd set up a scheduled meeting for Nancy Pelsoi in the oval office. But I'd lock the door and laugh and laugh and laugh when she stood on the other side saying "I can't get in!" Teach a man to fish. Walls do work. That's why we have walls.
Harry Leon Hann you must be on drugs.  SMH,My total opinion about Nancy Pelosi and why she does not want the wall is because behind the scenes I believe she's working with the drug cartels just like the other Democrats that are involved and not wanting the wall because if a wall goes up that's less money they will be receiving from the drug cartel from bringing in the drugs into our country I think she's also my opinion a part of the human trafficking that's going on in this country they don't want to give up all the illegal money blood money that they're getting off these drug cartels the people involved in the human trafficking so we'll never see the wall cuz they will fight to the end because they will be losing millions and millions of dollars every year just my opinion
William Bieke some people are complete idiots and you can't argue with stupid,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Matt Bachugan difference is apparently you are counting on yours.. for some of us it's just a bonus, some of us don't count on money that isn't in our hands.,Ryan Wasajewski 1. A large trampoline is around 500 to 600 dollars 2. Itd make trump a criminal to not pay taxes 3. Damn son wered you get that diss almost hurt my feelings
Hey asshat you are getting your refund jerk off.. stop crying,Ryan Wasajewski 1. A large trampoline is around 500 to 600 dollars 2. Itd make trump a criminal to not pay taxes 3. Damn son wered you get that diss almost hurt my feelings
Mary Kay Gaffney why don't you go live on the other side of the wall if you don't think it is an issue and see how safe you are,No we just want YOU  on the other side of the border. Permanently. Go live with your boyfriend Vlad.
TreSa Sanfilippo you need to have your head examined,There is no crisis, you damn moron. What's more important? OUR country, not yours! You don't own us! You work for us! What's more important. Families wondering if they will still have a roof over their heads? Afford to pay for needed meds? All because of your damn wall. Special place in hell for you and your followers.Open up the government! We are getting well tired of your negativity, and damn tired of all your damn lies and fantasy world.

Show me sources that state such bullshit !! Do you even know who blocked women’s Equal rights amendment to our constitution? Republican conservatives! Dont be mislead by stupidity!

Greg collusion is not illegal remember obama 2012 russia favor to putin in his election oops obama colluded,with russia election 2012,in asia,William Parker Jr. That Mexico will pay for the wall?
Karen Bailey Yost yep they are traitors to americans time for a gallow democrats hung like we did saddam,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you sound like a stupid dumb record playing over and over....
Russians are in mexico and so is the chinese tanks look it up on youtube,TRUMP : "I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great great wall on our southern border and I'LL HAVE MEXICO PAY FOR IT"
Tiffany Davis yep i agree back in the day it would mean war,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin when the wall gets built I hope someone throws you over it.. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Janece McClain amen!,Trump 2020!!!!❤️🙏our prayers are with you as you MAGA!
Stan Piznarski Amen,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Danielle Moore   dufus....,No other country has open borders why should we
Eolo Nizzi II trump has actually surpassed our expectations for employment.  I don’t care if a wall gets built or not.,You noticed
Jacquelyn Scherer that’s my problem no one is telling us how we will secure our border just saying no to a wall for spite isn’t going to help.  I would like the benefits they get for seeking asylum cut off,“Working together to secure the border” does NOT require a wall.  Get over yourself!
Tyrone Brummeyer to long.,Helen Selgren Lyman,   Yeah, I suppose most Trumpets won't be able to concentrate long enough to finish it.  Oh well.
Martha Pickens here we go again. Just have to mention Clinton and Obama. Nothing better to come up with I guess! The defense of our nation should not be dependent on a lying, draft dodging con man. He would not know how to defend our nation nor does he have the mental capacity or intelligence to learn. You can‘t say that about Clinton or Obama. Funny how we are always less safe when it is a Republican President with the scare mongering! Last time I checked 9/11 happened under a Republican. Oh and Clinton and Obama were not in bed with the Russians!,I guess that is why you are a draft dodger! How are those Bone Spurs? ROFL!
How many LIES will President Hoax be delivering in his FARCE delivered tonight from the headquarters of CENTRAL FAKE NEWS AGENCY operated out of the Oval Office???,you mean a wall?
The same thing happened to me from a man that was a US Citizen and serving in the military. The point is these things happen and the people doing so will be legal and illegal at a proportion relative to their portion of the population. Just as my situation does not mean that men in the military are bad your situation does not mean illegals are bad........only that the individuals that perpetrated this on us were bad.,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, “Daniel Zuniga” who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didn’t take responsibility because they said they didn’t contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found. Find all underground tunnels coming into the US.  #BUILDtheWALL President Trump 🇺🇸

She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

James Chapman Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin fake crisis is your opinion you got from media opinion. Truth is the voters, the president & Federal border agents disagree. What one would you choose, media bias or the source of people who are on the boarder, the president who has access to info no one else does, the voters who put someone in office to do a job that has gone unchecked for years? Why are the Trump Zealots alway making False Claims and False Accusations??? Sorry unlike the Trump Cult I think for myself though my observations are often later repeated on various media. I have know President hoax for decades and he has always been a very FAKE MAN and Pathological Liar that has no credibility. His whole life is built around lies. He is nothing more than a very successful snake oil and elixir salesman. I lived on the border when many more people were crossing the border at the busiest part of the border and there was no crisis or emergency.It is not true that moist people that live or work on the border want a Useless Wall that can be easily circumvented. What most people want including people that live and work there is smart border security. That is what we need. Trump has created a completely fictitious emergency so that he and his cult can get what they want which is completely wasting billions of dollars in taxpayers money. But you ain't gonna get it as We The People, and that is the great majority of American's, oppose the Wall. Trump and his Cult will not get their BOONDOGGLE WALL!!! Get over your obsession and move on!!!!,Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens! 🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️

The number of white ppl who make derogatory comments proves my point.  Especially the coward who try to laugh but have nothing to say...because THEY ARE WHITE and the only ppl they know who support this president.,Please don't build a wall....ONLY WHITE PPL who don't want more POC in the USA want that.
Betty Jo Lollis thank you! I only shared so this way people know that MOST if not ALL illegals won't accept the word "NO" I have learned from this experience and I only hope that my story will entice others to break their silence too. It's ok to talk about it. It's a BIG problem amongst other things as well.,I was working for an employer who had hired illegal immigrants and didn't notify the staff that had been working there. One of the younger a_ _ holes invited me out to his place for a beverage, the boss's son even said he'd be there so I thought nothing of it (we both were young and he wasn't bad looking) so I kindly accepted the offer (2nd mistake) 1st was even talking to him in the 1st place. We planned a time and he gave me the address, now keep in mind I was currently residing in a smaller town where at this younger age it didn't seem to be an issue to go to someone's place.  Upon arriving I had to go through a cattle gate, house was out in the country, upon arriving to the house, there were more guys out there than I had originally thought there would be. I then decided that MAYBE this just wasn't a good idea and I was trying to leave in my car, never had gotten outside of it. I found out that there were a couple of men outside and they had chain locked the gate closed and I NOT wanting to destruct property, demanded they open the gate. No one would open the gate, one other guy had made his way into my car and forced me over and drove me back to the house where there were 7 maybe 8 illegal immigrants and a 50+ yr old Male who MIGHT have been a U.S. resident. They dragged me into the home where they forced themselves on me, forced liquor down my throat and then proceeded to take me into a bedroom where I continued to fight them off of me, one by one they all took turns, they all were all over me and it then became a group thing, I fought and fought what seemed like hours, once everyone had their fun, I managed to crawl myself into the bathroom, near the bedroom I was in and in there the 50 yr old man put me into the shower, by know the liquor had kicked in and I was pretty much a lump on a log. So I was finished off in a shower with this horrible 50+ yr old and left alone once all were done having there fun. I yelled and screamed I kicked and clawed I threw punches I even tried to bite, by the time I came too I was naked in a cold shower and even though I was still pretty well lit, I was able to get just enough on to get myself out of the house and my keys and get in my car where I was able to then escape any future sexual assaults. I wasn't even sure if I was going to be held longer or released. I tried to file charges, but after that night all men were on the run including the older man himself. So nothing had ever come of it other than me getting counseling. BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD THIS WALL TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.  I would NEVER wish a gang bang on even my worst enemy. I have gone through counseling and I have over come my situation. I have a daughter now, and I fear that she NEVER EVER endures such a HORRIBLE HORROR.  This happened about 12 years ago, but it has only gotten worse  since then with the population of illegals.  Let's protect our future!
Don Darby so forget the hard working people in America that won't receive a paycheck for their family huh smh,Honey Jar how many people lost love ones from drugs from open boarders save your smh .

If democrats cared so much about Americans not working then the government would be open! TRUMP wants 5 billion we spend 150 billion on illegal  immigration a year ! That sounds LIKE a good reason to build the WALL and democrats couldn't care less about the American people . It's ALL about political power! Shame on u people,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Kevin Rodriguez isreal mexico , if you look they a lot more ,,No other country has open borders why should we
Worley Michael , say that up close, not behind a pc,,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
we will to, ,,American arms and armed forces kills families in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and probably Venezuela and Iran too. So all those mentioned countries will allied either China or Russia to protect their beloved families.
James Domitrovich , he’s deid,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Dave Mosley Jr.  The dynamics of that changed when Democrats refuse to negotiate anything. Congress has one main job. Pass a budget. That hasn’t been done in decades. No business can operate without a budget.   Who has gone on vacations during the shutdown. Democrats. Who was planning on another trip with friends and family during the shutdown? Nancy. Who was planning on being out of the country and not being there to negotiate? Nancy. Who was going to be gone when yet another payroll period ended on Tuesday for the workers she claimed to care about? Nancy. Who lied about concerns for security for the SOTU address without asking Secret Service or Homeland Security first? Nancy. Who HID from Angel Families who were right outside her office? Nancy.  Who got her plane snatched out from under her? Nancy.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited

Bob Segal - 40% does not make for a high approval rating.. No matter how you spin it..,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

Amedeo Corey  tear down the wall you say..........we all can put signs with arrows pointing the way to your house. You deal with them. Feed them, care for them for the rest of their lives. Let all the criminals go see you and your family instead. Put your loved ones at risk.  That's how you want it?  If a wall is mideval how come Obama has a wall around his house? Hmmmmmmmm🤔,you mean a wall?
Hazel Ramey 😂,you mean a wall?
Mary Christine King 😂,you mean a wall?
Time to care about our homeless Vets first!,you mean a wall?
United States can't take care of the whole world. People staying on food stamps and welfare for the rest of their lives.,you mean a wall?
Medea Helsel here in San Diego also. You can always tell who hasn't been effected by illegals or don't live in a border town. RIGHT?,Patti Vargas I have both, but thank you for your concern. In addition to those, I have beliefs, morals and resolve. But thanks again.
Scott Williams Umm. . .say it loud: " Americans want A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT.",You lie.

Danny Jones-thank you for your faith and support for President Trump and our country. Hope things will get better for your country.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Linda Gurtz Hildreth probably fake ones like the Obama birth certificate.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Hello dear,The way I see it is the Democratic Party is putting the American people in danger.  They aren’t agreeing on the border because Trump wants it.  They are just making themselves look really bad.  Yea, but their homes are surrounded by a wall.
,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
Mitch Haynie ....its called the military for these types of issues not a wall buddy....,41 year low.....
Amren Dugan  Typical Hillary follower.,No other country has open borders why should we

Don't ask it, you have already know it that d bitter truth 😂😂😂😂,Yes my man keep up the good work
,Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens! 🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️
Linda Durbin  he only works three hours a day,Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens! 🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️
and Allah is a false God where he should not be associated with nor should these dumb muslims assocuate themselves with such a false maggot,they say believe in Jesus but Jesus is a man and any man who makes another man a husband is Gay and what will theoutside countries do to a bunch of gay men!
Linda Silver hahaha are u mad lol,Trump this is total Bullshit! What a Propaganda post ! We will be a Nation and "STUPID Trump" isn't gonna fly in with his tights and cape to save the day ! Trump you are so PATHETIC! Trump,your first and only priority is to open up the Government NOW, so these people can get paid ! Trump, you think that by NOT paying the Border Patrol that there won't be the cartels to swoop in with butt loads of money to tempt these people! Wow, that sounds a might bit CRAZY! There had already been CORRUPTION on the Southern Border !Trump, you are complete imbecile,pay the Coast Guard ASAP, they keep our borders "SAFE" ! If this is Not some kinda of "SiCK " game and a Political ploy to "USE" your CRAZY base,then prove it ! OPEN UP THE GOVERNMENT! I still am interested in where all the 1.6 Billion Dollars that you got in March went ? Why are you asking for an additional 5.7 Billion dollars ? Why hold these Feberal workers "Hostages" just so you can say "I won " ? It should demonstrate to the American people that you don't "Care" about the citizens of this Nation and that you are a "Greedy ,INCOMPETENT,EGOTISTICAL,,LIAR "! Trump your tweet about Schumer is very PATHETIC,you Fired Comey because of the "Russia Thing"! What Trump are you grasping at straws? Trump ,you could go today and TESTIFY to Mueller Face to Face and put it all behind you ,since all of this is just more Distraction from the Meuller investigation! Dude,you still have the option to RESIGN before you are in PRISON! Why don't you just to that,save the country money and time in your IMPEACHMENT hearings !
Renee Duckworth Milliken ummmmmmmmmmmmmm.... what?,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Brett White Do you believe all of Trump's lies?,Trump needs to resign. He is a disgrace to the office. He needs to stop with all the lies and be truthful to the American people.
Angel David Hernandez esta gente la neta ke si es pendeja pero ke le ase uno seguir aguantando al elote mal parido 😂,The borders are secured, you're just desperate for 2020
Buck Strunk yes, there are many other countries in Europe for example.. Had you ever been out of the United States?,No other country has open borders why should we
The Coast Guard, you know the ones who STOP all the drugs he's got you upset about....They are NOT. The welders who fix their boats? ARE NOT.  TSA, who actually stop the terrorists...are NOT. He has sacrificed EVERY US border to get a political win. Screw him and his support for it.  Don't tell me this is about border security. It's about trump's tiny penis size and slipping popularity and impending indictments.,So PAY THE F*CKING COAST GUARD. You're putting us all at risk.
The prefect metaphor for Trump supporters is a person who finds a piece of garbage on the ground and thinks it's a $100 bill. When you point it out the the person, that it's, actually, trash; instead of throwing the garbage away and saying, "thanks, " They point to another piece of garbage and SCREAM at you, "WHAT ABOUT THAT TRASH, THOUGH?!  THAT'S GARBAGE, TOO RIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT TRASH"  Sure - but I'm talking about the piece of garbage in your hand, that, still, isn't a $100 bill.,So PAY THE F*CKING COAST GUARD. You're putting us all at risk.
Punch line: I'm not a Democrat. I like Ike and Lincoln - they are ROLLING IN THEIR GRAVES AT THIS MONSTER.,So PAY THE F*CKING COAST GUARD. You're putting us all at risk.
We are less safe than we were for this. That's on the Trumper-tantrum.,So PAY THE F*CKING COAST GUARD. You're putting us all at risk.
Christine M Terry   I’ll Second that. !,No one but this great man could withstand the abuse and the lack of support and still accomplish the unthinkable. You’re a warrior, sir. We thank you and we love you. God is with you🙏💙. In my 74 years, no one even comes close🇺🇸
Rod Novoa and I’m assuming you got you information from democrat leaders or watching CNN because it’s obvious trump is the best thing for this country in 70 yrs numbers don’t lie best economy in 50 years lowest unemployment in 40 yrs more African Americans working in history more Hispanics working in history highest wages for women in history set the record high stock market in HISTORY! Created more jobs in 2 yrs then obama did in 8 in fact created more jobs than the last 3 presidents have! But still he is the worst president ever in the eyes of socialist democrats!! So I’m assuming your information has come in the form of manipulation from your democrat leaders along with CNN (FAKENEWS)! It’s ok to think for yourself! And if you ever come across a little common sense please don’t let it get away from you shame you can’t buy some!! Good luck with your recovery,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dwight Haddix History Books,The KKK kills people everyday.   Where's the wall
Exactly,The KKK kills people everyday.   Where's the wall
Beverly Hurst Smith oh I don't know he didn't do much. Just turned the economy around big time, created best unemployment in over 50 yrs. Got North Korea to the table, the first President ever to do that, got the GDP up to double what Obama ever achieved, got over 500,000 manufacturing jobs back from Mexico and China, got new and better trade deals with South Korea, Canada, Mexico and others. Etc etc etc. No didn't do much in the last 2 yrs. 😂 😂 😂,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
I need a remedy,I guess it’s up to you mr president   Keeping Americans save  way the dems are slicing baby’s throats it no wonder their position on the border
It’s funny how they shut up about Virginia,I guess it’s up to you mr president   Keeping Americans save  way the dems are slicing baby’s throats it no wonder their position on the border
Lynn Limauro Floyd  sorry to another broken heart 💔,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Jereica Renea Kirby  thousands are killed by guns and the Republicans do nothing,Thousands  killed  by  guns  and  trump  Does  nothing
Jereica Renea Kirby  thousands died from no health insurance and the GOP do nothing,Thousands  killed  by  guns  and  trump  Does  nothing
Ricky Wallace that's a lie.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Victor Manuel that may be but until you've visited the border you have no idea what it's like.  I'm sorry but it depends on who you ask as to which story you will get,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Dave Callender get your head out of the sand,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Chris Cjkodaharianna made me laugh outloud! Well said!!,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Ruben Radar Rodriguez  more people like u need to speak out!!! People need to stop being quiet because they are scared,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Marj Mansley Calderwood Stan is just telling the Truth.As a democrat that was not a Trump supporter, Trump has done more for our country and Gods will than any president since Kennedy who drafted me in 1963. I thank God for all those christians in those vast red states to elect president Trump.I did not like what Trump had done in his life before he bacame president either. I also would not have liked Paul, David, or Moses those awful  sinners God used to do his will.If God put Trump there, God will keep him there, even if you an I didn't like him Marj.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Mitch Haynie just like if Ted Bundy wasn't here right? Just like if Rudolph wasn't here right? The facts are the criminals are a dime a dozen like always. The majority of us are law abiding, and just fucking work to pay bills. You've all got some lazy ass, shitty no good criminals, in all your families as well. Should that label your entire family as criminals, or just the asshat who committed the crime? So entitled you are 🤣👍,And a US citizen shot up Columbine, Shot up Parkland, don't get me started on Eric Robert Rudolph, or Ted Bundy. American Terrorist attack at the 96 Olympics in Atl.

Brandon Sikes It’s already being done.  There are cameras, patrols, armed guards.  Illegal immigration is at its lowest point in 18 years.,“Working together to secure the border” does NOT require a wall.  Get over yourself!

Althought when Rep had both the majority in the House and in Senate, it requires 61/100 approving votes to pass a bill to fund the wall in the Senate, (which did not happened.) So no, he still couldn't do anything without Dems support. But I'm sure you knew that, right?,Best president ever! In parallel, most insulted president ever! Thank you Fakenews for ruining (with your lies and nothing burgers) the image of this great man.
He could use executive order or his "humanitarian crisis" yet he seems to want to have the parties unifying and agreeing for it. The Democrat party members used to want that wall, Obama, Schumacher ,Pelo etc, did.  Why the change of mind? Why ?,Best president ever! In parallel, most insulted president ever!

Estefania Torres Restrepo California  LARGEST INSANE ASYLUM IN THE WORLD  Interesting that the LA Times did this. All the others are staying away from it. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this should be of great interest to you!  Just One State - be sure and read the last part...  try for 3 times.  This is only one State... If this doesn't open your eyes, nothing will!  From the LA. Times:  1. 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right)  2. 95 %of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.  3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.  4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.  5. Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.  6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.  7.

In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.

Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin this does not even take into account the NAFTA deal he negotiated..The part media fails to inform you of is what the NAFTA deal means and how Mexico IS going to pay.... I'll explane...  ~It forces USA metal to be used *(HUGE for American jobs and American steel sales generating billions) and it will keep automobile manufactures in the USA (worth billions).  ~Americans bought $71 billion more imports YEARLY from Mexico than vice versa. That's about to change in Americans favor.   ~At least 30% of the cars must be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour to keep American car manufactures in the USA (That increases to 40% in 2023:) Autos that don't meet these requirements will be subject to hefty tariffs.   ~Canada must open up its dairy market to U.S. farmers. It will eliminate its complex pricing scheme for Class 7 products. That includes milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder, and infant formula etc.   ~It opens the wine market in British Columbia to American wine. (Billions to America).  ~Mexican trucks must meet U.S. safety standards before crossing the border.   ~Provides more protection for patents and trademarks. Saving tons to American's who have been ripped off of their ideas & costs Americans billions and also helps reduce black market.   ~U.S. drug companies can sell products in Canada for 10 years before facing generic competition. Extending it by 2 years. (Billions generated)  ~Companies can no longer use Chapter 11 to resolve disputes with governments, they will now have to pay up instead. The only exceptions are U.S. oil companies.   ~We no longer fund Mexican abortion clinics. Exports drastically reduced, for one example sugar from Mexico cut nearly in half, creating more jobs and revenue, tourism industry hit hard, federal employees banned from traveling to certain main areas.  *Of course, Trump didn't really expect Mexico to just write the US a check as some ignorantly say as "fact" :),Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens! 🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️

Belinda Price   Agree , call National Emergency, Shut down folks go back to work , Build The Wall,Dear Sir: I agree with you wholeheartedly, however, it is the people you serve to protect that are being penalized. Call off the shut down. Call a National Emergency, if you must. But get this resolved QUICK!
Denise Jacks   Next time pay all government employees but do not pay Congress since they collectively cause the problems.,What the Government should learn from this shutdown is that people “do not” have 6 months savings for an emergency!  That needs to be addressed!!
Derrick J Johnston   It’s winter and cold outside, nothing to do but have some fun  replying. Hopefully spring comes soon.,I came here for the comments. (Was not disappointed) I find it halarious that everyone needs a voice on social media instead of a hobby in real life... maybe everyone should go outside for a bit...  The government has been shut down for how long? And the sun still goes up and down every day. Something to think on there
Ross Jones   If you weren’t already locked up , I hope you would be on the other side of the border locked out.,Un SOS   Im  a psychopath locked in the NHS mental health system currently in hospital knowing full well  that all health care is controlled by the secret service currently being injected against my will enforced by law  Thet put images of my father and uncle on the packaging  of imperial tobacco products and stole the money physcopathically directing their tumors
James Kenney   Wind Bag,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Danny Jones I feel for our British allies Elect a real leader thank Goodness President Trump was victorious or our culture be in the toilet also where’s Churchill when ya need him,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Carl Ostendarp guns again are not the problem people kill people not guns snowflake,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Patti Cullen stfu go chase cars ugly,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
why are you so stupid,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Eddy Coulson, why are you such a shithead? I suppose you want to open up the border and abort babies "you people" should be aborted starting with your mother after all she had defective children. I bet you are Gay..........🖕💩here a picture of your mother and your brain.........🤣,Still,  using children's deaths to make political points.  Trump is one sad lowlife.  Your gun deaths are your national emergency
ok mr know it all what would,I'm sure a wall would have prevented all the school shootings that happened last year
Go to school learn to spell you are a subhuman species.,Great. Waste beelions on a wall that the illegal immigrant probably flew over.
you are dog ass stupid,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Why don't you stay focused, to damn stupid,James Ellis great response, keyboard warrior.
Their kids are already brain dead,It won't change until a Democrat in Congress loses a child.
My bet is his "8 minute" speech will be 14 mins and 22 lies. But I'm probably lowballing the lies.,Vicki Zamow he let in the country.
Homo?  First off, I'm straight.  Second off - love how republicans try to claim a moral high ground while also using an entire classification of people as a euphamism for "stupid". I'm positive Jesus would approve.,More terrorists come in from canada than mexico. Drugs come through legal ports of entry.  Stop holding the country hostage, ahab
Rachelle Tanzil lol no the didn’t tell me where republicans stopped obama on anything?,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Lee Grant  And you're a fool, or a bot. Are you so stupid that you think the rest of the world isn't affected by your country's activities or your mentally retarded President? Get a life, idiot!,Oh, go grow one, Donald. Your most important duty was pretty null and void when you deferred . . .  what was it . . .  five times? What a useless excuse of a man!
Larry Favre - I didn't mention rigged elections to point fingers, or go off on a red herring tangent.  There has been plenty of evidence of elections being "rigged" across the country, and likely even more that has gone undetected.  That was not the point of my proposal.  ASK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC directly, and stop relying on whether the President, or Congress thinks it is a good idea.  After all, they ALL work for us - - so IF the majority actually want the wall, then the debate would be over, and they should fund it.  IF the majority does not want the wall, then those who do can find ways to fund it without Congress.  Either way, crossing the border must be done legally, so who is in favor of enforcing our laws on entering the United States?  Let's not be afraid of the truth!,Let's have an official special issue vote for the border wall at local election sites.  Only those who can prove they were born in the U.S., or are legal citizens may vote.  No fake polls or rigged election.  No mail in ballots, or dead people voting.  Let's find out how many Americans support our President and really want this southern border barrier built.  If the public says to fund it, then the Congress MUST fund it.  My guess is that at least 3/4 of the whole population want the wall built.  Democrats are afraid of the truth!
Tom Caskey Awww - did I trigger a liberal who slaps back with a huge informal fallacy.  I didn't provide any "numbers" as facts.  I said, "my guess" which is clearly an opinion.  I proposed a vote be taken to find out how many people really support the wall.  You must be one of those Democrats who are afraid of the truth.  You talk loudest, and think that means you are in the majority.  😆😅😂🤣,Let's have an official special issue vote for the border wall at local election sites.

Lora Hill Well one reason is all the mainstream media will show is some women and kids trying to come in. Not the thousands of drug runners who terrorize anyone who gets in your way. Or the one officer who covers 1000 square miles. Are the families whose lives are threatened by the cartels.,Oh my god some one needs to give me a call because I live down south and illegals kill our animals and breaking in to houses while children are sleeping to steal; there are barrels set out with high flags with Augua to stop them from damaging our property
Lora Hill it's has to stop now or we will become a 3rd world country. But that's what the globalist are hoping for. I for one don't know what to do but get ready to fight. Just wanting on someone to say GO!!,Oh my god some one needs to give me a call because I live down south and illegals kill our animals and breaking in to houses while children are sleeping to steal; there are barrels set out with high flags with Augua to stop them from damaging our property
Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets. But if you listen to mainstream media or the Democrats nothing wrong with our borders.,Oh my god some one needs to give me a call because I live down south and illegals kill our animals and breaking in to houses while children are sleeping to steal; there are barrels set out with high flags with Augua to stop them from damaging our property
Danny Jones we need our own Donald Trump! He’s the greatest President of all time,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Emily Neal let me continue your story.

Gun reform works.

Tim Masters if the tradgedy happened to you would you feel the same? Doubt it,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.
Why are you so fucking retarded? He was voted into office by the people, dumbass.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow really so you going to belittle heavy set people. Some people can't lose weight and don't eat that much they have physical issues with their body that makes them retain weight. You sound just as ignorant as your party,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
High treason, multiple counts...,High treason, multiple counts...
If schools would actually do something about the bullies in their schools, we wouldn't have half the shootings we do now. The schools claim to have zero tolerance, but when you actually report it, they claim that kids will be kids. So you want safety inside, then they need to fix their bullying policies, and start expelling all kids that have been know to bully others. This is the schools problem to fix, not Trumps.,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Jacqueline Alas exactly!,An American just murdered 5 Americans and this is his focus 🤦🏻‍♀️

Matt Walker  That would be awesome but there is too many unelected deep state big money greedy globalists sitting in DC that does not care one thing about anyone but themselves and how THEY want to see this country ran.,Then it is time to rise up, grow some balls like out founding fathers and remove them all, place them on trial and inprision everyone of them.  Sometimes it is just time to grow a pair and make a change.
Brent Robinson He should have started in 2017 when the republicans were the majority he wouldn’t be playing the blame game,,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Gary Kane He became president in 2017 why didn’t he start then for his wall when the republicans were the majority ?........?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Kenny Shuster get your head out of your ass we need the wall,The Wall is a figment and an fixation of Trump's sick twisted narcissistic mind! Mr. President!! Get help!!

No, that isn’t at all what it is like. A wall is a moronic idea that will never happen with or without the funding because the land is privately owned. It will be tied up in courts for decades! It is an unnecessary waste of resources. Since you people resist reliable news sources, I strongly suggest you start looking at objective data. Court filings, the US Army Risk Assessment..,etc. Or, don’t and be gobsmacked when you find out just how idiotic your comments were, and how close you came to losing the country you profess to love.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Lorrie Tracy  Rod Novoa is one of those aoc douche bags that wants free free free while sitting on his ass doing nothing.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Linda Sonn lol he don't need money. He gets no pay to put up with idoits. Your really some kind of Stupid!,There has never been a MORE DISGUSTING PERSON IN AMERICA  THEN THE TRAMP.  YOU HATE AMERICA BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BARROW MONEY FROM AMERICAN BANKS. YOU HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO COURT BECAUSE YOU DON'T PAY PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR YOU. PLUS SOOOO MUCH MORE. I'LL BE DANCING IN THE STREETS WHEN YOU AND YOUR CRIME FAMILY ARE IN ORANGE PRISON SUITS. POS
Rebecca Thomsen Koskey aren't you even curious to read the article? A little too much Truth for you huh? Scary words like the Supreme Court and judges and lawyers and facts. Yes, facts. You know those things that your Lord and Master is allergic to? Hold on to your hat honey and make sure that your Depends undergarments are fastened securely from here on out. Because it's about to hit the fan royally.,William Bieke he keeps his Campaign lies at the expense and the suffering of the American citizen. Pull your head out of your ass.
Rebecca Thomsen Koskey yes ma'am thank you for pointing that out! I absolutely hate when my country is raped and pillaged and destroyed by a traitor. And I'm sorry for you that you are not. But you see, we all are not conned and we are not easily bought for a temporary tax break and a handful of empty promises. I've known who Donald Trump is since 1980. You're soon going to find out who you put in the White House. Your denial of it does not make it any less true.,William Bieke he keeps his Campaign lies at the expense and the suffering of the American citizen. Pull your head out of your ass.
Lily-Ann Silva if you mean Donald Trump, he works on my dime. He does what I want. He's a public servant. And no, he is not allowed to be himself. We were all hoping that he would tone himself down, listen to his advisors and his generals and the people that have more experience in government than him. He could have done this right, he could have combined his knowledge of finance and their knowledge of politics, government and Military and been a good president. But no. He's got to act like a thug or a spoiled two-year-old and do all kinds of fucked up stuff AND lie every single day of his presidency. The fact that this country doesn't care that our president lies every time he opens his mouth is a disgusting situation. And it's worth being angry over. This is not what our forefathers OR the millions of people who shed their blood for our freedom had in mind. We have no allies. He's pulling us out of every single peaceful agreement that we have worked so hard to be part of and lead the world with. You better hope nobody drops a bomb on us. Nobody would come to our rescue. Not even Canada.,William Bieke he keeps his Campaign lies at the expense and the suffering of the American citizen. Pull your head out of your ass.
Lily-Ann Silva a minor point at such a moment. I think you're on the wrong thread.,William Bieke he keeps his Campaign lies at the expense and the suffering of the American citizen. Pull your head out of your ass.

Eyon Deen what an idiot and crybaby,WHEN YOU TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE DUMB-ASS...YOU PROMISED THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR YOUR STUPID BORDER WALL. WHY ARE YOU NOW DEMANDING FUNDS FROM CONGRESS,, JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A FUCKING SORE LOSER?? Manage
Another of Trump's lies! The DNC does want border security; but not a stupid, unaffordable wall!,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin  ok I will bite; LIES, FARCE, CENTRAL FAKE NEWS AGENCY, explain.
The Democrats want to help the country by stopping Trump from destroying it!,Janet Wood its the Dems destroying by not wanting to secure the border! We can't take in all of Mexico and central America and give them benefits!!!
Liz Livingston This analogy is getting old and furthermore not even relevant!,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Andrea Berkstresser this doomsday propaganda is killing me,Excellent!! Thank you ladies and thank you Mr. President!! The wall will be built,  stay strong and defeat this attempted coup by Pelosi and gang or America will be lost.
Bonnie Massey how do we tell President Trump we want him to resign I think that there should be a petition for all Americans to be able to sign,How do we tell Nancy and Shurmer we want them to resign I think that should be a petition all Americans should be able to sign also because every where I go it's all I hear people saying they.  Want these two idiots out

Dean Clouse Yeah. No. Not sure if you have noticed but the majority of Americans do not want this.,Nancy and Chuck don’t care what the majority of their constituents want, they just want to keep you from succeeding!
Dean Clouse if you would kindly do your research you will find that the terms have been talked about for years. Spoke about when Reps held the House. Old news. BTW doesn't matter anymore anyway.

Come on people its been over 2 yrs now. I'm out gezzz,The President offered ALL the items the Democrats want as per Nancy Pelosi’s rejection letter except only a three year extension on DACA and TPS recipients into 2022 (well after the next presidential election btw) in exchange for $5.6 billion for physical security on the southern border.

Guys leave me alone I wont entertain your stupid talk,I was so disappointed, rejected at the SA embassy yesterday.  I wanted to visit Disneyland!! How bad is that your staff rejected me???? You humiliated me, I lost all respect for USA now  so disappointed. Lady judged me in a 10 second interview. Australia beats your country.  Cant believe it
How can you judge her based on an illegal alien. Msybe she had no choice to fly that way,I was so disappointed, rejected at the SA embassy yesterday.  I wanted to visit Disneyland!!

Greg Haase and they work. Just ask Israel or the Vatican or Nancy Pelosi,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
John Robert We the People have power and we should use that power whenever we can right now the Democrat Party is being nothing but obstructionist and we can give them our opinion by calling them. Here are the phone numbers  Nancy Pelosi in Washington DC. (202)225-4965 In San Francisco (415)556-4862  Chuck Schumer in Washington DC (202)224-6542.  or FAX (202)228-3027  I don't have a fax machine but wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a whole room full of paper in his office tomorrow? If you call and leave a message try to be civil but aggressively push 4 a barrier at our Southern border. Thank you,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Gary Kane .....we will send them to your house....Address please!!!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
They are not going unpaid the military is being paid the house is being payed the Congress is being paid. If it was another president that wants this it would be passed with no problem. But the selfish people who want to control our rights and doesn't care about the American people will stop it. What happened to supporting your president what happened to America sticking together the problem is everyone wants to blame the president for everything that is wrong in this country they need to look back on the pervious president and see what they did wrong. The way I see it is this is the only president that all you people out there are criticizen on. It seems like no matter what the problem is it's the president falt when are the people going to Stat take blame for their own actions. The only thing the president is trying to do is make our country safe again, get the drugs the murders and the human trafficking out of our country. I believe in our president and will support our president and I think more people should stand up. Instead of all the hate this country has they should come together to make our country great again.,Border security all the way
I think it's higher.,CBS stated before the President spoke that their polls show only 59% of the people want the wall.  I CALL BULLSHIT!
Sarah Knutson they are not laughing they  are crying because Trump evened the trading field and countries are not sucking Americans dry anymore.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Hal Eric Mitlitsky I guess it will all be left up to the Supreme Court.,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Alex J Rod he’s not building the wall with his own hands. He did what he needed to do. Do you ever do anything relaxing on your weekends or do you just work seven days a week?,Rod Novoa  amen
Michael Melbert he’ from California.,I know 500 people who were shot almost killed in Vegas.... Anything being done about that?  Your promise that Mexico will pay for it died yesterday 😂😂🤣🤣🇲🇽🇲🇽
Christopher Thompson I think most of the opposition is because these people know it will work .,Those who oppose a wall are obviously hoping to support illegal activities. Search your soul. The cost is a non-issue and pennies in the dollar compared to the outrageous waste of our government.
CliffandKim Ferrell don’t you wonder how many of the trolls on this page are actually illegal themselves??,You know best President Trump!! You do what you need to do!  Your base is behind you 💯 🇺🇸❤️
Dennis J Sitko they’re our citizens and they will be punished. We don’t need criminals from other countries.,What about the thousands killed in mass murders by white American citizens
Jason Erhardt a lot of those crimes against immigrants are done by illegal aliens.  Build the wall and enforce our laws,Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
Katie Hamilton Kramer that particular girl wouldn’t be dead if her killer was in his own  country and had not broken the law by coming here illegally.,Conservatives- DoNt PoLiTiCizE gUn DeAtHs, sTuPiD DeMs  Also Conservatives- Politicize deaths at the hands of illegal immigrants.   UPDATE- You are just as dead if you're killed by an illegal immigrant as you are by a legal citizen. Only difference is, more people are killed by legal citizens every year than illegals lol. BaN uS cItIzEns!!
Lark Jarvis you must think you have a lot more knowledge than the men who work for border patrol and deal with situations at the border every day. They do think a wall will help.  I think a lot of people like you just don’t want it to help.,Statistics don’t bear out this story. Anecdotal evidence is not statistics. You can cherry pick stories, but it doesn’t change reality. A wall is ineffective and a waste.
Link Lindquist this post is not about immigrants, it’s about illegal aliens,For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not “criminals” by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of “criminality” ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of “felonies” have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized.
Mary Zaggy so??? Did anyone say he was?,The guy who massacred FIVE people in Illinois yesterday was not an undocumented immigrant.
Michala Dotson we’re not talking about immigrants, we’re talking about ILLEGAL aliens. There IS a difference.,We have criminals on the daily that are citizens including every shooter lately who happens to be a white nazi supremacist that also happens to be extreme supporters of Trump but every once in a while an immigrant commits a crime, big or small, and that's all that matters. Not the REAL crime problem of actual citizens. By no means am I supporting a killer but using it as a political boost is ridiculous.
Oliver Oriel it certainly will be a lot harder for them. I say we stop making it so easy. Build the wall.,Walls can't stop a determined immigrant, he/she can either chose to dig an underground tunnel or even climb over the wall...how about you just come up with a good policy.
Piper Tunno the shooters are either dead or in prison.  We have criminal citizens who are punished. We don’t need to add illegal criminals from other countries to the ones we already have.,Do their lives matter more than the multiple children killed each year in mass school shootings?
Raja Ali none,How many native Americans your family killed
Shady Ghaly you must live in a state that has really high taxes.,Claiming 7 ??. You have no idea what you are talking about
Steve Ware what’s your point? Every country has bad citizens that do bad things. That’s why we have prisons. That doesn’t mean we want illegal people from other countries that also includes bad people.  We have enough of our own to take care of.,While this is a tragic story, I can't help but wonder how many illegals kill Americans vs how many Americans kill Americans. Would be an interesting comparison to start with.
Sue Howie what does one thing have to do with another? We can do better about making sure our gun laws are followed and at the same time build the wall make sure our immigration laws are followed.,Kris Kline Give sources..
That would be 1,886 less if they had been in their own country.,Janie Rogers Doss   True. But that would be 17,200 less if Republicans would get their heads out of their asses and the NRA out of their pockets.
Yvail Fox that would be,Janie Rogers Doss   True. But that would be 17,200 less if Republicans would get their heads out of their asses and the NRA out of their pockets.
,You promised Mexico would pay for the wall. How come you didn't shut down their government?
Rod Novoa  your masculinity is what is the fraud here, "rod". How about grow a pair, remove tour head from your ass and act like an adult .,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
First of all, I have sympathy for these people trying to find a better life but the US cannot continue to take care of these people.  It is costing us billions of dollars monthly now.  Can you imagine the cost if we allow droves of them to come as these caravans from central America are coming?  Once you let some in, nearly all from those countries will be here.  We have our own needy to take care of and doing a somewhat shabby job of that.                                  How many are you willing to sponsor, Art?,The wall along with better technology, more personal, etc will all work together as our CBP has recommended.  We need to include more drug sniffing dogs.  They do a great job.
Lee Grant  if the Nancy thing was referring to something else I would love for you to say it....rather begging for you to say it because it would prove you are just as worthless as he is,All you are looking for is to line your pockets.... if you were concerned with the boarders why did you wait 2yrs????
Lee Grant  you are obviously a trump cocksucker.... if you mean the current speaker no not a fan but I wouldn’t support trump because he could careless about you or me trust me I have seen his 20 plus years of destruction from AC to Fort Lauderdale so don’t come at me you little cocksucker..... I served my country unlike the draft dodger 🖕🏻,All you are looking for is to line your pockets.... if you were concerned with the boarders why did you wait 2yrs????
Lee Grant well bitch I replied so go f your self,All you are looking for is to line your pockets.... if you were concerned with the boarders why did you wait 2yrs????
Fake news.,The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!
Screw Trump and screw that stupid wall!!! President is a moron,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
The president is stupid plain and simple!!! Stupid wall stupid for shutting down government. Stupid for being him!!!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Sally Gillespie Bailey the president is stupid plain and simple!! Screw Trump and the wall!,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!

Kathleen Scott our guy Dan Crenshaw is an example of the kind of congressman all of your states should want. He literally refused his pay check until other government workers get paid. That's integrity.,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Robert White dumbasses everywhere lol,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
Jason Cefai The polls weren't wrong, he lost the popular vote by 2 million.,*Fox news polls basically show support from the base but nobody else lmao
Another chump supporter informed, check.,Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
Cindy Sue no illegal immigrants do not get social security. Your so clueless! They pay their bills, they buy things, they work, they eat.  Just how do you think anyone that lives in America gets out of all taxes, work, and bills?   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/20/trumps-false-claim-that-undocumented-immigrants-collect-social-security-benefits/?utm_term=.b87654fbfa1b,Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
Cindy Sue wrong about 11,000,000 illegal immigrants are currently in America only about 55% are Mexican but chump wont tell you that. Chump does not mention any illegal immigrants that have white skin.,Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
Fyi they take care of themselves for the most part. They work and pay over 300 billion in taxes.   http://immigrationimpact.com/2018/04/16/undocumented-immigrants-pay-taxes/,Chump you should show the crimes against immigrants there will be at least twice as many. You should be ashamed of yourself for politicizing tragic deaths to push your sick agenda.
Corey Groff sure — how about we do SOMETHING about the real national emergency?,A madman killed 50+ people at a concert in Las Vegas — we must regulate firearms.  Or do we only use anecdote to make policy when it suits you ...

Bert Bowers if his mom did anal we wouldn't have to deal with him,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Christopher Curry  According to the Democrats,  came through the port of entry and put his name on the list so they can keep account  (statistics), they talk about them all the time !,How did that illegal get here?
Victoria A. Deobald  That's interesting considering she doesn't support Israel and she supports all the reasons 9/11 happened.,Imagine if Hillary had been elected  !
Mike Kizy id rather have a tax cut for whomever makes under 100k,Protect us from Russia.
Peggy-Lynn Reeves A good portion has the Rio Grande, not desert area. It’s feasible, look at the Suez Canal.,Turn that border into a canal! Dig it deep enough that the sides become a natural wall. Then the US and Mexico get trade growth from the canal being used, and we get a deterrent to illegal border crossings!
Letitia Werle  were you there personally watching them do this or are you a total liar just like Donald duck trump,Several thousand illegals climbed over a fence into New Mexico last night and no one stopped them...several thousand mostly men.  Build the Wall!
Marcos Ramirez I guess his accomplishments mean nothing, it’s cool just wake up with hate in your heart and MSN in your ears,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Lee N Kristen Wilcox so no facts just name calling?  Ok good for you,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Unless you're Natave American, you can STFU! Those crayons you're eating are effecting your IQ.🤡,Lil Donny, your at a point where you are losing biggly! Good luck with that wall idea of yours. 🤗🤩🍾🥂 Also I agree, his address should first be put on paper.
John King yes! Let's start with Mar A Lago. There's a host of illegals working there.,There is no doubt that Pelosi will reject the President's latest offer. That being the case I would:   Immediately proclaim a national crisis and get the military building barriers.  Secondly, I would let ICE loose. By that I would have them raid thousands of businesses and immediately deport any illegals found. As a nice measure I would give a 1 week notice that these raids are about to begin. Thirdly, along with deportation I would arrest either the hiring HR director, or if no one fits that description, arrest the front line supervision for hiring illegals.   Lastly, I would implement a 25% fee on ANY monies wired to Mexico and Central America.   If the President would implement a get tough program I would guess Pelosi would come begging to finally get this immigration issue solved once and for all. This crap needs to end.
Uhm... we don't. You don't need a wall to have border security,No other country has open borders why should we
Cindy Ann Godfrey if you hate are President so much why are you following him Troll Much,Mitchell James lol didn’t bother looking did you
Paulo Americo Rocha very few attempt crossing the desert it is a very long and arduous Journey through train that most of the year will kill you from dehydration in less than a day.  I assure you it is much easier and more common for someone to hop in the trunk of a car then it is to cross the Sonoran Desert.,The vast majority of illegal immigrants that cross the southern border enter this country do so in cars through ports of entries how is the wall going to stop them?
Bullshit,The promise was , Mexico is gonna pay for it
Buck Strunk we don't have open borders dumbshit. You need a passport to come in,No other country has open borders why should we
The wall will never be built, it's just a hoax... If someone wanted it to be built, they'd make it happen, LMAO... Don't be a puppet...  There's so much more to the story..,Why don't you and other millionaires buy the wasteland properties along this border and do as you wish with your private property... A wall doesn't have to be on an exact line of property.  They built gas pipelines for miles and miles through citizens property.  You're telling me property can't be bought that runs close to the border in a zigzag line that has a private wall built on it's property???
Anne Crossway vote your conscience, I sure will!,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
Kenneth Armstrong thanks, revolutionary insight from the fourth grade Ken. Hoping the President can find the same loopholes your liberal base uses to fund every Democratic Socialist program they think up.,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
You obviously don't have a mind of your own.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

Alexandra Ica Hanciu what genocide  lol,ONE more of American life lost is already enough... UNACCEPTABLE Stop the genocide of our people.
Isiaq Olalekan Abdulraheem what good work,Yes my man keep up the good work
Joseph Bernadzikowski did you like what Obama did... did you live somewhere else,Some of you people are painfully dumb.. Go live elsewhere if you don't like what Trump is doing
Juanita Craner but mumbers show immigration is low,Thank you, President Trump!! If there has ever been a time to declare an emergency, it's now!! Invasion of our country IS a dire emergency! Unlike weather emergencies, the problem with invasions from our southern border will not "blow over", but will only get worse. Thank you for your work and determination to prevent our beautiful country from being turned into another Mexico. Behind you 100%! May God bless you and all your endeavors!
Linda Gayle Hutson is good they are doing that to the president,The financial records of Every Politician who oppose border security needs to be openly investigated and made public! Those who scream the loudest should be investigated first! You don’t oppose security unless you are profiting from it!
Lisa Pursley when did they start the wall...,Thank you President Trump for your dedication to secure our border and protect the American people!! We trust you, stand with you and support you 100%. We know you have our best interest at heart.♥️  God Bless You and God  America!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸#TRUMPPENCE2020 #FINISHTHEWALL
Mary Larkin American people will receive a smaller refund this year after filing their income tax returns. The Republican/Trump tax cuts is a big scam that only benefits the rich. That's all Paul Ryan wanted; he got it and ran away.    “Lower tax refunds might hurt the economy. If Americans are getting less money back, that might mean they're going to spend less of their refund.” - Jordan Valinsky  Your (small) refunds will be delayed thanks to President Donald Trump’s shutdown.  "I DIDN’T NEED TO DO THIS." - Donald Trump as he declares a national emergency taking billions of dollars away from our Veterans, and leaving for Florida for the weekend to PLAY GOLF.  “Trump biographer Craig Unger detailed Saturday morning the links between the president’s ties to the Russian mob and the silence of his former campaign manager Paul Manafort. Unger, author of House of Trump, House of Putin, explained on MSNBC’s AM Joy that unlike the Italian mafia, Russia mobsters report to Vladimir Putin — essentially making them “state actors” for the Kremlin. “I found 13 people who have had been in Trump Tower, associated with the Russian mafia,” the author explained, adding that the organized criminals “on and off for 35 years” used the president’s flagship Manhattan building “as a base of operations.” When Donald Trump “over expanded” in Atlantic City and went bankrupt to the tune of $4 billion, “Russian money played a huge, huge role” in his financial bounce-back.” – Noor Al-Sibai  JOIN THE GENERAL STRIKE APRIL 15, 2019.

Sharon Miller my friend wad killed by a white person should at build a wall around them too too keep me safe,I’m so sorry that these Dems don’t give a damn if you lose a loved one it’s only about their agenda nothing else! Pray to God that these evil people will come to their senses 💔
Veronica Torres are toy even paying attention to hope much money the trump family is making off this presidency...I do respect your opinion but facts are facts,Donald Trump is the best President ever trying to save ys from the democrat communists thieves that want to destroy America so they can keep the money they stole for 8 years , they are using the communist trolls as agitators and traitors to America
Chris Kirk walls work great ask prisoners,What’s so bad about a wall? I am really trying to see this from both sides, but I honestly cannot grasp opposing. Whatever the facts it won’t hurt? Spiteful anyone? 🥃
Trump and his supporters hate people like you though,Eric Wroblewski thank you
No one said your a democrat were just pointing out the obvious truth... democrats destroy everything they touch !! Mic drop!!!,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that’s where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don’t see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That’s unacceptable.  Anyway, I’m done discussing it.  If 🇷🇺 doesn’t interfere,  😉 I’m sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.

Talk to the dems,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Move south,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Araceli Rodriguez Move south,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Stephen Pierson Speaking of dumbasses, you know other presidents have declared emergencies before, right? Hell, Carter even did it during the Iranian Hostage crisis. Learn some history before posting stupid stuff dumbdick,Good speech yesterday. Most people found it to be common sense, although common sense isn't very common in democrats. I would put a timeline on it though and declare an emergency if they don't react. A lot of Feds are behind you, but we can't hang on forever. Build that wall!
Yeah, if we dont' get the wall with Trump, we never will,I believe that TRUMP will be the last American president who will fight as hard for America as he does, all future republican presidents will fold because of their fear of the democraps calling them names like they always do.
look it up on youtube they are there especially hillary. otherwise  go back to msnbc..troll,while addressing the nation tonight they should play the clips of all the hypocrite dems endorsing the wall in the past.
Jonathan Schremp God knows he's a lying, hypocritical, greedy, dumb ass.,God Bless you President Trump! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
Take your pills, Bob,Dumb!
Dumb!,Dumb!
Joe Calabrese no when dems do the right thing all they got do is give up money for the wall and it's over balls in their court,Please open the government. My husband has been protecting the public from dangerous inmates and   is working for free. We have two children that we need to feed and provide shelter to! Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.
Arnold Ringer idiot,This isn't Trump's shut down, it's Putin's shut down.  Trump is doing Putin's bidding by crippling our society by its foundation.  Can't you see that Trump is tearing us apart by the seams, he divides us, propelling our young to animalistic hate.  Does this make you feel good?
Danny Joe Gardner wrong,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Dawn Joseph-Hernandez not the point idiot illegal why cant you idiots understand illegal is against the law,oh please! americans are killing americans by the thousands every day!!!! look at the news! Man having an affair with co-worker kills pregnant wife an 2 children! i guess thats ok because he was white and a cheater! go pound sand!!!
Adonus Lloyd I’m not worried about it. If they wanna get our guns let them there are over 5million Americans with guns who would laugh at them trying to get them. No one is going to put them down I say about out of the 5 million maybe 100 thousand would disarm them selves that’s about it.,Don't be surprised if he does an assault weapons ban cause he already ban bump stocks. He use to support the assault weapon ban years before he ran for president. He has already went against the promises he has made.
Adonus Lloyd define assault weapons.,Don't be surprised if he does an assault weapons ban cause he already ban bump stocks. He use to support the assault weapon ban years before he ran for president. He has already went against the promises he has made.
Tonya Conway no you try first.,Right!, don't need a 2nd attempt.
Chet Bentley Yahweh (That's HIS Name NOT God) had NOTHING to do with her death!. WHO is responsible? Answer: The Evil One who I will NOT honor with a name because his name has never been removed or changed, JUST MULTIPLIED! Which ONE resides in YOU? PRAY NOW to be SAVED and SEALED in Yahweh the Father and Yahshua His Son, Revelation 14:1 HalleluYah! Hebrew: "Praise ye Yah!!",God killed your daughter. He would have done it through any human.
,Hey President Donald J. Trump! I am going to be BOLD here. I hope SOMEONE reading UNDERSTANDS! POTUS, please be like President Abraham Lincoln (whose birthday went unnoticed on February 12)! STOP catering to The Vatican and doing its BIDDING! Stop deceiving us Americans! GET REAL! Stop talking about a pretend wall!! (Eliminating illegals would hurt your businesses.) STOP ILLEGALS INSTANTLY! Fine businesses for hiring THEM! We are seeing more and more of them everyday. Put drug dealers (all around us in this very affluent area!) and child molesters (including Roman Catholic priests) into the FEMA camps instead of the homeless and disaster victims! STOP THE GRIDLOCK!  We DARE YOU to PROVE that YOU ARE PRESIDENTIAL!

Lisa Carbone wake up fool.  Your wannabe dicktator wants to give us all to Russia.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Terri Pryde move!,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Gary Kane  NO. Each Refugee costs tax payers $82k per year. You pay tax payers are already overburdened by illegals needs,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Angel Roy and guess what?Have built walls to keep bulls from breeding  other people's cattle!!!Broke down walls..... can't stop an animal n heat .😂😂😂,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
But I never go to doctors for sniffles....we farmed and knew how to stop the illness of our livestock.And everything else that goes along with a lifestyle of working for others...it's not just a job.But we couldn't afford health insurance. My husband was a very successful business man but we had no control over the price of our products.I worked for nothing but insurance for the last two years of his life at a school till  he passed from a rare neurological disease at 64. Insurance may not have prevented his death,but the quality of his life would have been improved.It can happen to anyone....no sniffles here.......cause I know the difference between life and death...and what a wall can and cannot do.,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.
Christine Huggard Roach which doctor....there were several,as anyone who has undiagnosed illness knows.By the Grace of God.........,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.

Shirley Wilson and I must tell you our VA does suck....being ran by folks with no experience and don't care.Son just retired from AF,was in the whole show last 25 yrs....he has a state job working in fraud division and our VA is in shambles.The wall should take a backseat to our problems at this time....drugs are gonna get here,workers will be hired by the wealthy,and things will continue till our mind set of helping others instead of putting up walls physically or metaphorically change.Its all realative.I hope you have found peace.😊,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.
That's true!!!!!,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.
Tommy Carpenter I am good....husband died peacefully at home where he had bought and paid for doing what he loved.😊,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.
This man's story is tragic.  But securing our borders, making sure that criminals are punished and can't get back in does not translate into a physical wall.  4th century solution to a 21st century problem.,Jeanne Lumadue excellent comparison
Cindy Cripps-Prawak sweetie he's the one trying to negotiate please turn your TV from CNN,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Brian Tozier and you my friend are a useful idiot.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Colita K Williamson I suppose you hate people having jobs and getting increases in their wages. The influx of illegals have stifled wages for years.but I'm going to guess that doesn't matter to you because you probably don't work or if you do you work for the government.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Elderly all live off the government? I paid taxes up the ying yang when i worked and i collect Social Security and that was money paid in. Now that I'm elderly and disabled i guess I'm supposed to die.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Fred Diaz—you poor simp. Didn’t you just get released from a mental institution?,Walls don’t stop murders. Walls don’t keep illegals out. Walls don’t do anything but satisfy a mentally defective old man’s base of support and those people are screwballs and failures.
Larry Lubiner why?? Because it's true?,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Well he got Korea to stop launching missiles, he gotten Korea to release hostages, he got Korea to return our fallen soldiers, tax cuts for US citizens, more jobs, brought back jobs that past administrations shut down, prison reform for people that gets out of prison. Ect. But i think keeping us from going to war with North Korea and stopping the missiles flying our way was priority, don't you?,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
SE only morons and traitors RESIST.......,The art of the deal is being played out and its obvious Pelosi didn't read the book lol.How can people of this country not see how Pelosi doesn't care about her own state all she cares about is attacking Potus.
Fact is you dumbocrats started it all with the wall. We are gonna finish it. Go ahead click the link pussy....  https://www.facebook.com/100001873735362/posts/2436751456397288/,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Alberto Weisz I’m no fool. I know a door gates and fences do nothing to keep anyone out of my house.,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Paul Gonzalez I take the average of multiple sources. No one has said 99% support for the wall. Not even 99% of republicans support the wall,What about the hundreds of families who have lost a child to gun violence in their schools? Why do you not own their pain?
Paul Gonzalez hahaha that’s a fake news for sure. What’s your source Trump or hank hills daddy,What about the hundreds of families who have lost a child to gun violence in their schools? Why do you not own their pain?
The government has no right telling a women what they should do with their bodies!,What about the hundreds of families who have lost a child to gun violence in their schools? Why do you not own their pain?

Erik Biggs I think you forgot. Remember when they said they wouldn't pay, what did trump say. The wall just got 10 ft taller, pepperidge farms remembers.,You stated Mexico 🇲🇽 was gonna pay for the wall ?! Did you forget
You know a government employee that dont make good money, I dont, and if they can't manage their money that's on them. Everyone seems to not save for a rainy day anymore, and spend more then they have. Also when you hire into those government positions, one must always expect this to happen, it happened many, many times before and know one screamed bloody murder.,You stated Mexico 🇲🇽 was gonna pay for the wall ?! Did you forget
You know what the guy makes in 5 years and benefits you or me will.never see. Most city worker make upwards 45-120k and can retire with 15yrs with a full pension the we as taxpayers foot the bill. Me myself I've work 35 yrs full time. These people aren't out of a job, most are on furloughs still cashing in on your dime.,You stated Mexico 🇲🇽 was gonna pay for the wall ?! Did you forget

Losing..so much losing.  The Hill”. 56% no, 44% yes.  Gallup poll: 57% no, 43% yes.  Quinnipiac:  54 No, 43 yes.  Harvard CAPS/Harris:  56 No, 44 yes.  A poll by NPR, PBS, and Marist found 2/3rds of this polled don’t think the wall should be a priority.,Ann de Roo-Daly he already did with nafta....
You're the fake news Joyce. Only a minority, like you, want the wall. The majority of We The People know it's a farce.,Stephen Pierson actually, the majority DO want the wall.  You’re listening to fake news again.
Lisa Rudloff: reading the comments here is like using a klan rally crowd to convince yourself that everyone hates blacks.  The reality, from a half dozen polls, is you're in the minority.   Does the majority of America Want a Wall? Nope:  The Hill”. 56% no, 44% yes.  Gallup poll: 57% no, 43% yes.  Quinnipiac:  54 No, 43 yes.  Harvard CAPS/Harris:  56 No, 44 yes.  A poll by NPR, PBS, and Marist found 2/3rds of this polled don’t think the wall should be a priority.,John Decker  maybe you should read the comments
Mike Donovan Eff off, liberal loser,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
You mentioned that they use underground tunnel, right? Is building wall making sense?,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, “Daniel Zuniga” who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didn’t take responsibility because they said they didn’t contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found. Find all underground tunnels coming into the US.  #BUILDtheWALL President Trump 🇺🇸

Arturo Elroy Mañana the wall will work,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Gary Kane move to another country you liberal so and so,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Ruben Radar Rodriguez bahahahahahahahahaha,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
No, you don’t.,We need this wall!!!💯
No way Jose! Get it? Jose?😂,We need this wall!!!💯
Where are you going to find a new housekeeper and gardener?!,We need this wall!!!💯

Linwood Coleman ever since 2016!,The office of the presidency is broken.
Jo Sechi And your point is?,I love that Donald J. Trump is working to protect Americans and he is acknowledging these angel parents to help them heal. ❤ May their children's deaths not be in vain.
Jo Sechi Surely you're not implying that deaths caused by illegals are less significant because they are fewer than gun related deaths? And to go all the way back to 1968 to inflate the number? How many gun related deaths last year? This year so far? How many of those are outside Chicago? Don't preach to me about gun control. The number of American babies murdered since 1968 far outnumber the American lives lost to guns. SIT DOWN.,I love that Donald J. Trump is working to protect Americans and he is acknowledging these angel parents to help them heal. ❤ May their children's deaths not be in vain.
James Kenney Obama sure did.  Thank goodness we have Trump.  MAGA 2020!!,agree 100%!  Thank you for all you are doing (and trying) to do.
Timothy Norton I would propose both. Seeing as the numbers of people coming are overwhelming.,I don't know how how she sleeps at night.
Bethany Kessel  actually by building the wall it will free up billions of dollars that are used to house, feed, medical and legal fees that are used on illegal immigrants when they are caught. So by lowering the amount of illegal immigrants that are flooding into this country will free up money that can be used to help the American citizens.,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don’t support it. Don’t say we.
Richard McGrath who cares?,BUILD THE WALL MAGA ALL THE WAY!!!!
Angie Small-Double I agree.  President Trump is amazing!  MAGA!,Stand strong, build the wall
Nick Demico and so they can use that against him in the election saying see he didn't get the wall built,Hey here's the problem the dumbrats and George Bush talked about border security. They also talked about building wall I meant a fence. But the fact is none of them had the balls to get it done. So now with one more year till the 2020 election  the dumbrats don't want the  wall built because they won't have those illegal Voters. The Dumbrats also don't won't Trump to go in the history books as a President that kept he's promise to the American People awhile keeping America Safe  and also making America Great once again.
Kris Landers if a known serial killer was loose in your neighborhood would you lock your doors? An illegal immigrant is a KNOWN criminal, therefore statistically more likely to engage in other illegal practices. Its really simple, logical, and moral.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Kris Landers so those who befriend or stand behind illegals are to blame for illegals actions? I like that idea.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Buck Strunk we don’t have open borders! What is wrong with you trump people! So dumb you believe a jackass,No other country has open borders why should we
Ijeoma Amaka repent,Joel Nash...God bless you
Judy Goebel we are counting on trump to be in prison soon!!! Then the round up of all you traitors will begin!,Amen! Thank you for all you do.  Hang in there. We are counting on you.
Mario Salerno he’s destroying this country! Trumpets are such idiots,thanks for saving the country
Amanda Parker-Leinart I honestly agree with the shut down people need to wake up and see that America is more important,Jennifer Ogelvie  That's not the way. What if his choice of shut down was where you worked? The politicians just took a holiday vacation with pay.... those 800,000 that are furloughed or working with no pay had no dog in this fight. Most of them live paycheck to paycheck. They didn't deserve this.
It’s all about the wall. That’s it. Just the wall. That’s all you speak of anymore. Why aren’t you fighting to fix the healthcare system?,I’ll tell you what’s more important to me. And why I voted for you. Healthcare.
Vicki Zamow hell yeah he was!!,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
But if that illegal immigrant wouldn't have been here...,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
But if that illegal immigrant wouldn't have been here...,Jennifer Yvonne Croff you are right, but i could also blame alcohol: if there wouldn’t be alcohol she would be alive. Should alcohol be banned?

Dumb ineffective wall to climb or fly over, swim or boat around, tunnel under, blast or cut through. Pure ignorance, from ignorant play president. He wants a government shutdown to golf more. Lazy crybaby babbling incoherent corrupt conman prick.,No other country has open borders why should we
There are far more criminals and murderers  that are white Americans ,  not to mention all the other American gangs and criminals than the 0.0132% of illegals that are criminals. Most drugs come through check points, human bodies, planes, etc. Hell, the drug cartels, can spend an extra couple of hundred dollars to go to Canada first then here. I mean damn...they have submarines and bring them all up and down the coast. You think an ignorant wall will stop them, lmbo! They are laughing at us!,No other country has open borders why should we
Trump supporters , you have no relevance. You are a Trump supporter. You obviously have no common sense, no morals, and are too gullible to have an intellectual opinion, since you are dumb enough to support Trump. You have been conned. A damn wall really? A wall to swim or boat around, because the wall can't block waterways. A wall to dig under, because they haven't been building mile long tunnels across the border already. A wall they can't climb over, blast or cut through like they have done. A wall they can't fly over....I mean, Trump supporters have no common sense, to know it's a waste of money. Especially, when we have a homeless problem and places like Flint!,No other country has open borders why should we
Kathy Werbicki dumb ineffective wall to climb or fly over, swim or boat around, tunnel under, blast or cut through. Pure ignorance, from ignorant play president. He wants a government shutdown to golf more. Lazy crybaby babbling incoherent corrupt conman prick.,He just wants to government shutdown so he can golf more
Kathy Werbicki, the man baby doesn't know what work is! In less than two years he has golfed and vacationed more than our last president did in 8 years! He has done so while profiting off of us tax paying Americans, by staying and playing as privately owned Resorts and golf courses. He is a con man. The Democrats have said every day for him to re-open the government! That there are other ways to secure our border other than an ineffective wall!,He just wants to government shutdown so he can golf more

Roy Meston can you provide facts to back your statement?!? Conspiracy theories aren't fact....just want to make sure you know that.....also, HOW DO YOU KNOW? Just speculation right?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston have you tried building a wall? Because I can tell you that it may not stop it ALL but it will slow it down. We waste billions over dollars every year, but now we are unwilling to waste billions on ACTUAL Americans for a chance to save not only our lives but the lives of women and children who are ASSAULTED when attempting to come to America? I'm the kind of person who looks at my glass half full, you must be a half empty kind of dude.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston how can you call saving lives a vanity project. If building a wall saves ONE person from death, or ONE person from being sexually trafficked, or ONE person from having access to drugs, it will be worth EVERY DAMN PENNY.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston no, that would be Mr  And Mrs. CHUCKY who are holding the people hostage...he has TRIED to compromise, which is what a leader is suppose to do. When the other side is unwilling to work with you, THEY become the owners.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston your comment is just funny.. I mean really? Of course building a wall won't fix everything over night, but it's a DAMN start. At least there is an idea on the table.... I'm mean really?!? And you have the DAMN balls to try and talk about people's IQ's...,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston 90% is a slow down buddy but I'll take it over open borders ANY DAMN day,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Paul Chiplock the federal employees are not most people....,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don’t want this wall.
How do you know, have you tried it?,A wall will NOT fix our immigration system.
Do you support stealing from those who have earned it? I don’t understand. Stealing is stealing no matter how you do it and stealing is wrong,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Comparing people to dogs... seriously?,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
Why do you think he is the best,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Mike Maynard That is not true at all. No Democrat ever has called for open borders. Republicans just like to say that's what Democrats want. But no Democrat has ever said that. If you do not have a social security number you can't vote in the US. So no illegals can vote for Democrats or Republicans. Democrats win more often then Republicans, because they show human compassion more often then Republicans. The vast majority of the people in this country want that from their leaders more then the strong arm approach. You don't have to agree with me on the surface. But just think critically as to why the last three Republican presidents only won the electoral college and not the popular vote, while the last 3 Democratic presidents won the electoral college and the popular vote.,No other country has open borders why should we
Casey Voigt Thats how you whip mindless drones into shape.. constant repetition. He has to spam this message, cause he is still trying to convince America, that this is what we want.,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.

Kinda makes it look like its a bunch of made up BS created by right-wing talking pundits like Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh to whip you mindless people into shape. You should not listen to those folks, they are steering you wrong.,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.

Michelle Helderman If that scripture were referring to a person then trump would have a capital T. You are just grasping at straws. Also, God would never condone the actions of this man.

King James Version (KJV)
Michelle Helderman You are a nobody, same as I am. You witnessed nothing. You saw a little thing in your book and latched onto it with all you have, with the hopes it would explain to your practical mind, why your spiritual mind thought voting for this highly immoral person was the best choice for America. I don't mind being prayed for, as I will pray for you as well.,let me know when you see it...... 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 King James Version (KJV)  51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

Ryan Allberry why don't we build the wall and and save 147.8 billion a year and house our vets and help the American citizens? Hmmm spend 5 billion to save 147.8 billion. Doesn't take a genius to figure that out.,It will cost around 70 billion, where are the actually statistics to prove that number and helping out vets has been a consistent problem for decades
Mitch Haynie Take your Meds, Mitch.,And how many Legal  (Americans) have killed the daughters of other Americans ??
Chris Jordan G  "Dictate what he wants," Chris! He wants a wall! WE WANT A SECURITY WALL!!! His main campaign promise was that he would build a wall for border security, and he is trying to fulfill that campaign promise to the voters that won his election.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
John Wheeler  Well John, the answer is simple. Nancy and Chuck can allow $5.7 billion for our security wall, which is peanuts, and everybody immediately goes back to work.  Or....the Democrats continue to allow open borders in order to harvest votes from hundreds of thousands, even millions eventually, of illegal non citizens from several South American countries. This practice was unheard of and a crime around 10 years ago.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Robin Barnhill  President Trump has been negotiating for "secure borders," with new technology, haven't you been paying attention, and, with a wall. i'll bet you don't live in California, but I do, where the homeless are taking over the state with free medical care, and business's going bankrupt and our citizens fleeing the state to get away from the craziness of the democratic rule.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Stan Piznarski President Trump will be reelected unless the Democrats are able to keep bringing in hundreds of thousands of illegals for their illegal votes. Yeah, that's a pretty scary scenario!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

Dave Heffner it’s already illegal to cross the border,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
Devin Diamond I don’t believe being illegal was the reason they didn’t press charges,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
Samuel Tan Yuan Han Most illegal immigrants overstay their visas.. How’s a wall gonna address that issue?,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
John N Karen Morris  report drunk driving,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.
Nancy McGill Trump doesn't give a damn about DACA kids either...or the kids he stole from their parents at the border...or the kids of the 800,000 unpaid workers. He only cares about himself.....,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
,
Craig J Grove I can't wait ! Locked and loaded,There is going to be a second civil war the way we are going.  😃
Albert Kojo Kyekye all you are doing is repeating his false talking points.  Are you being paid?,Eric Wroblewski thank you
James Smith do you lock your door when people come and ask you for help?,Jesse McMurray yes but they knocked first
No one is saying we should have open borders.,No other country has open borders why should we
Your statistic doesn't hold any proof... especially if you live in El Paso, Tx,Sympathies to the family but the odds of her being killed by a mass shooter in school, or by a drunk American are statistically higher than what happened here.   The courts failed long before he got to her.   There is nothing in these articles that say why he was illegal, just that he was suspected of being illegal.  Did he overstay a visa?  Is he a DACA kid?    Too many unknowns.
Same surveys that said Hillary would win in a landslide I'll warrant.,James Jerome  Surveys have already been taken, and most Americans DON'T want the wall! I know you categorize that as fake news, but those are the FACTS! Your post also infers massive voter fraud by Democrats! That also has been DEBUNKED! If anything, there has been voter fraud and suppression by the Republicans! As for TRUTH, Trump promised Mexico would pay for the wall! What happened with that?
,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Look, have you ever in your life been to the Mexico border in any state that it’s shared? I have a couple of times. It’s just as dangerous as being in the woods and walking past a hungry bear before winter. Women are raped and their clothes are left on trees as trophies! You’re clueless! Hopefully trump builds his wall so when you get old and die your kids left behind have some protection! Protect our borders. Build a wall!,You are playing the stupidest game with semantics.  Replace the term “border security” with wall and the statement is false.  You need to recognize we all want secure borders, your the dim wit that keeps making it about a wall
Paul we need someone to defend us all from Trump.... he is not part of our nation. 😑,Defense by shutdown- your logic is nonsense
Albert Kojo Kyekye 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Stella Barrett #fakenews,Jessica Rufus tell me what’s fake???  The ripple effects of the shutdown will have a significant, negative effect in the economy.  Do you know anything or just absorb the pap on Fox State Network?
Yes! Build the wall! You'll see the capability of these people to have tunnels and big enough ladders to cross over by the time finish the wall...,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
Ann Stevens one way or another, Mexico pays,Ron Wissler Now that’s intelligent ..
Thanks Ruben. Ignore the Dims spewing hatred.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Did I say import more criminals ? I dont see that in my comment ? But you cant go around blaming immagrants for every bad thing that happens and say nothing when your own does the same.,Lol theres people killed daily, Americans killing americans , theres shootings very often and they're usually American people and you use Immagrants as an excuse to build a wall? President trump is pathetic, the same goes to his followers that without any proof believe all the lies mr moron says
Buck Strunk if all the other countries decided to jump off of a bridge, would you do it?,No other country has open borders why should we
just build the wall with them two on the other side of it!,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1155510014605234&id=227505360917068
LOL...I thought it was a beautiful and effective point in his address. We do not build walls because of hatred of those on the outside, but for the  love of those on the inside, I am over this WALL nonsense. They need to secure our borders. It is not a racial issue. They need to call it a Place of Entry. Every country deserves this.,Wayne Elliott yes because he wasn't living the dream before the Oval Office. I think his own whale was just fine.
Linda Lynch you know that isn't the only issue. If an American commits murder, they are prosecuted and laws are put in place. Your point is silly.,Last year in the U.S. over 12,000 people were shot and killed by American citizens and Trump fights tooth and nail to prevent any common sense gun control. About a half dozen people are killed by undocumented aliens and Trump demands that we spend billions of dollars building a wall. I guess he doesn't think that it matters if your child is killed by a fellow American....I guess he thinks you will only mourn for them if they are killed by an undocumented person.
Rick Scott their faces already did from botox,your rigth they are ugly
Alix Kruz   Oh yes, if it’s in the news, it’s got to be true.  LOL,Turns out that there was rigging going on in the 2016 election, and Trump was steering it too!  #CrookedTrump
Jody Radtke Vie   Then why do we have so many illegals?,Tony Stewart you’re confusing them with facts! tRump supporters have a problem with facts!
MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT HONEY. THROUGH TRADES AND TARIFFS. YOU MISSED ECON 101. ;)  AND THE MELT DOWN IS COMING FROM PIGLIOSI AND SCHUMBAG. THEY ARE OBSTRUCTING. BLESSS THEIR LITTLE HEARTS.,Patrick Buster totally! I disagree on politics with some of my best friends... even my husband sometimes. 😂😂

ILLEGALS ARE COSTING US OVER 200 BILLION A YEAR. YOU ARE DAMN RIGHT WE WANT A WALL!,And all of you want the wall built- how? Taking away land from U.S. citizens that the wall would have to cross? Interfering with migrating animals? We have more problems with people coming in on airplanes than we do with southern border crossings.
MARK.  SO YOU THINK KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS SITUATION THAN THE PRESIDENT AND THE BORDER PATROL?  BLESS YOUR HEART. ;),Micheal, that's a good one.  Typical snowflake trump supporter.  You come to the discussion with no facts or information just verbal attacks...so very much like Trump you are in that way.

Michael Dodson Happy Nobama Day,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Janey Renteria Happy Nobama Day 🇺🇸,The President offered ALL the items the Democrats want as per Nancy Pelosi’s rejection letter except only a three year extension on DACA and TPS recipients into 2022 (well after the next presidential election btw) in exchange for $5.6 billion for physical security on the southern border. Tell me again who is to blame for me continuing to work without a paycheck?? #sendabrick.
Kelly Cross obama and hillary are the mistakes.trumps the cure,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Max Bassanini you pay for abortions???,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
BUILD THE WALL!!,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Benedict Büchele we live in a free country, people can say what they want.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
How about learning how simple majorities and legislation votes are done, before you spout off,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
If you'd look in the right direction you'd figure it our for yourself, we can't do everything for you,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Dale Murphy I’m sorry you don’t care. Thanks for sharing your opinion on executive overreach with a clever gif.,Declares a national emergency, also states it isn’t an emergency, “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.”  And goes to Mar-largo  I’m confused.   What is the emergency?  And how is your administration responding to it? By golfing?
The constitution clearly states that congress controls the purse strings.   This has not been a priority for either parties since the inauguration in 2017.    Congress does not give the executive branch money.     https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-constitution-and-the-federal-budget-process/,Declares a national emergency, also states it isn’t an emergency, “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.”  And goes to Mar-largo  I’m confused.   What is the emergency?  And how is your administration responding to it? By golfing?
Allan Simpson with a dumb ass statement like that I wouldn’t show my face either tough guy.,How about middle class white kids shooting up the schools
Fred Shope our media is the immediate threat. China and Russia are just sitting back and waiting for us to destroy ourselves from within. Then they move in without firing a shot. If you happen to be a liberal you are aiding in the process.,Who's going to defend us from Russia
Patrick Patterson you have a problem with Angel families?,Trump is nasty 👹👹
Brent Robinson  Brent, two questions,   1. who admitted that he owned the shutdown mantle?  2. Why should a wall be built that 67% of Americans CLEARLY DON’T WANT.  Why should two thirds be held hostage to one third?  Please answer these two questions without name calling or deflections?,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Brett Beardsley  Lyin Donnie couldn’t fix a paper cut with a band aid...he’d destroy the band aid trying to get it out of its wrapper,Both sides are afraid you'll fix things, it gives them less to fight about and less to feel 'needed'. Keep it up!

Lyin Donnie has neither the wit nor the stones to just say it.....after all if the buck stops with all of us, and 2/3rds of the country doesn’t want the Wall...why is Lyin Donnie pushing it? Tillerson was right,Executive order. Just do it Mr President

Jill Travassos GAS LIGHT ALERT...GAS LIGHT ALERT On  Dec. 28, Lyin Jillie Travassos texted:   “THE DEMS, ONCE AGAIN, VOTED AGAINST PAY RAISES FOR OUR VETS.. TYPICAL. SHAME ON THEM AND ALL WHO SUPPORT THEIR SOCIALIST WAY!  #MAGA2020”    WHAT LYIN JILLIE DIDN’T SAY WAS...  “The Senate voted 85-7 to approve a $857 billion spending package for the Defense, Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services departments, confirming the biggest raise for military personnel in nearly a decade and avoiding a proposed freeze on civilian pay at the Labor Department.”  If  the Senate voted approval 85-7, DEMS HAD TO VOTE FOR IT because there weren’t 85 Republicans in the Senate! Beware of Lyin Jillie Travassos,Jocke Stangebye  I never pictured Stanley as a wanker...but now that you mention it...
Jill Travassos  Lyin Donnie....Lyin again  One part of last night’s address which caught my eye was that he also used it as a fund raising mechanism.  Most disappointing in a leader...for him to request media time from what he considers fake news sources, so he could talk to the nation about an emergency...and he uses it as a fund raiser!,Jocke Stangebye  I never pictured Stanley as a wanker...but now that you mention it...

When has he met with them?,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them. We see this in the recent drama from Buzzfeed. Absolutely amazing the reaction they had before they knew the truth and now after they know the truth. It’s a COMPLETE MELT DOWN.  WHAT A F——D up way to live!!!

Angela K Christensen You can’t have national security without border security. It’s not only necessary for any meaningful immigration reform; border security plays a crucial role in both the interdiction of illegal drugs and in defending America against criminal threats. Weak borders allow criminal and smugglers, as well as millions of illegal aliens, to have virtually free entrance to the United States.  If this was not true then why are there some 20 million ILLEGAL aliens living in the United States now, and why is there a drug epidemic killing thousands of Americans every year, and why are Americans being robbed and murdered by Illegal aliens.  Contrary to news reports the majority of these drugs are traceable to drug cartels in Mexico, not from pharmaceutical companies.,WHY is declaring a National Emergency to address a National Emergency in The United States considered wrong? There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve “emergencies” in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, "homes of the rich and famous” and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers"  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year." (* 2017, FAIR's)  This does not include cost of loss of life, property, and Democratic stability.
Waiting for congress to fund the act passed years before by the democrats to secure the border.

Patti Cullen as apposed to who Obama ? are you mentally handicapped ?  Obama scammed us out of fucking billions .. he gave billions to fucking Iran and then tried to tell us that we somehow owed them half of their entire worth because of some deal the Shaw made with us in the 70s?   .. ueah for half of the entire worth of their country .. for a deal made with a regime that was our friend that we have no obligation to return to a different regime that is one of our number one enemies .. who who who is the con artist ? fucking moron,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
To set an example.,No other country has open borders why should we
Susan Urena All the government employees will be paid.  Quit being a snowflake.,Jim Towery you are truly misinformed.   The government contracts out for many specialized services.  Those folks will not get any “back pay”.    Ignorance is the #1 quality of trump supporters.
Barry Davis.  You obviously have zero understanding of American history and the presidents who have given their time and talents to improving the life of Americans ... unlike trump who is only tearing down institutions and programs that we the people have established through our elected representatives throughout the decades.  You are obviously oblivious to the fact that unlike any other American president trump has given more to our enemy Putin who probably controls him or has something on him that he is obviously concealing.  If you don't agree tell me another American president who invited Russians and their media into the White House while not having OUR media there and where he spilled Israeli secrets to the russians.  That's not fake news we saw it happen before our eyes as was reported by America's free press (thanks to the Constitutional protection that our free press has, deserves and earns every time they expose trump's lies.,Will Titus That might be one of the dumbest things I’ve heard

Maureen Hersey Brown .... Want to know why just look at the way trump's supporters berate and call Democrats and other political critics vile names (as trump does to his critics).  i have immigrants living in my neighborhood and they are way more decent than some of trump's that one sees in his posts.  Incidentally, I'm a proud Democrat and veteran who has served with others ... of both parties so you're slam is not only wrong it's not patriotism in any sense of the word.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Bonnie S. Pickett Because there are fanatics like the trump supporters who have come felt free to express their hatred due to trump's encouragement with his hateful tweets. :),You're gonna feel betrayed when it's YOUR turn in the GULAG!

Casey Voigt ok goat fucker,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
Lol. And if you believe that, I’ve got some swamp property to sell you. When did the intelligence of the American people drop into single digits?,Prayer rugs found on New Mexico border ranches that should be enough to have the hairs on the back of your neck stand out. Build the wall!!!!
Kyle Callender ....Control laws TAKE lives......  The more guns in civilian hands equals less crime and safer communities.  Every year in the US guns are used millions of times to stop criminal actions.  By contrast a relatively few innocent people are killed with one.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

I've been saying the same thing except I'm saying trade the Democraps for the illegals and we would all be better off. After all the illegals are fleeing mostly socialist countries,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
they invade us....we invade them. let's see who's better at invasion.,how about conquering the southern Western Hemisphere and taking over. maybe THAT'S the answer. let's fight a war for US once. thank you.
Charlene Dickerson incorrect again.,The numbers show a border wall.is not wanted by a majority of Americans. Why does Fox Noise keep spreading this lie when Trump's own handpicked government officials don't even back him up because their own statistics prove he is not being truthful!

And over 40% of illegals come by AIR,There are too many innocent people being murdered every day and if you look at it long and hard you can see that it all is happening because there is no border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.  Weather it is from their drugs laced with fentanyl or weapons they brought with them or illegal immigrants who think the laws do not exist or pertain to them.  Build the wall and make them come through legally and catch the drugs and weapons at the port of entry!  We can't take care of our own.  Why are we still taking care of them.  The money it takes to build the wall will be cheaper in the long run from the money we save from Narcon used to save drug attics, medical, shelter and feeding illegal immigrants not to mention the loss of life we have to endure having them here.
Sandra Nelson errrr Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011.

Sharon George Seriously.. does nobody fact check this stuff While any death is tragic, a February 2018 study by the Cato Institute using 2015 crime statistics from Texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than native-born Americans.

Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher.,So sorry for your tragic loss.  Yes Pres Trump is doing the right thing.  It is unbelievable what the democratic party is doing to this country.  As long as we have Trump we have a chance to save this country.  Thank God for putting him in the White House.  It breaks my heart to think what our country will be like when my grandchildren are grown.  All grandparents need to contact their congressmen and let them know we're tired of their games and they need to do their job, support our President and protect this country.  Good vs evil.  Which side are you on?

Several weeks ago tons of Fentanyl was confiscated at the border, enough to kill thousands!!!! Yes, Jo do some fact checking BUT DO it through a reputable source. My advice; Christian based news, Washington media research, call your senator's to keep informed of bills being passed!!!! STOP listening to bias propaganda, it make your debate ridulious.
Carl Ostendarp On the guns there is a minor stumbling block for fools like you - it’s called THE CONSTITUTION!  I hope you know what that is! And your thought isn’t new, you are just repeating the usual canned lying liberal talking points!,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Silvia Serra Lobo But you don’t need any facts apparently!  Cough up your supposed facts to disprove what he said libtard!,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Beverly Hurst Smith he didn't have the votes. Needed 8 democraps voting with Republicans.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Kevin Lake If trump holds your values, Pleas feel free to “ love all over him”....Fo myself and  those I respect we will not as his values are not....,Note your poll numbers are tanking and even suburban white men show an 18% drop in approval....You make all this love for you up so you feel OK about yourself....It isn’t working...
Nicki Michelle Yes, you are correct...I’m hoping that taking the average of all the polls will be more meaningful...Of course the Russian collusion did have an impact....,Note your poll numbers are tanking and even suburban white men show an 18% drop in approval....You make all this love for you up so you feel OK about yourself....It isn’t working...
Doris Caruth Please continue to support trump as this is your right....It is also my right and duty to resist....His values are not mine....,Note your poll numbers are tanking and even suburban white men show an 18% drop in approval....You make all this love for you up so you feel OK about yourself....It isn’t working...
Sandy Swaney Mahady please look at all the polls (30 some) add them together and divide....You will get a much better picture....,Note your poll numbers are tanking and even suburban white men show an 18% drop in approval....You make all this love for you up so you feel OK about yourself....It isn’t working...
Brian Feeley Chuck Schumer is the biggest HYPOCRITE GOING!!!!,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
How come we can give Israel money to the tune of around $3 Billion annually and they are using some of that money to build walls and none of our politicians complain about how they're "wasting money on walls" in Israel?? The U.S. is partially funding those walls along with the Iron Dome anti-missile system! Yet not one word about the walls in Israel from Schumer or Pelosi!!!! They are 2 hypocrites! We also gave some money to Jordan and Saudi Arabia! We give money to everyone!!!!! Enough! Secure our border!,I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.
Jessica Amse I’m not using Trump.fantasy stats,Sympathies to the family but the odds of her being killed by a mass shooter in school, or by a drunk American are statistically higher than what happened here.   The courts failed long before he got to her.   There is nothing in these articles that say why he was illegal, just that he was suspected of being illegal.  Did he overstay a visa?  Is he a DACA kid?    Too many unknowns.
Lynn Knuth Pionke is there a document detailing Trumps plan? Or, is it to just “build a wall?”,They don't seem to care about the safety of Americans. I have tried and tried to get a copy of the Democrats plan and the cost of it and can't find anything but political banter anywhere !
Steve Deshner When the Dems approved the wall for the same reasons Trump wants the wall how did they plan to pay for it!!? Maybe you ought to check out facts and you'll get a surprise if you didn't already know!! The Dems not only approved the wall they set aside money for it and spent just a little bit of it to put some wall there. They stole the rest of the money, where did they spend it, to other country's!!!!? Mexico paying or not no longer should be an issue, not just Trump but millions of Americans want the wall also.Those that don't just happen to be us that don't want to support something's you do. There is up to 2,000 more illegal Aliens heading our way, in groups of 500 !! Their not all coming from South America, some China and Muslim country's!! Yep shocker all going to the US southern border!!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Mark Warren How about talking to the Border Patrol, they are saying they need the wall!!!!,borders are defended
Mark Warren talk to the Border Patrol, their saying they really need the wall!! Their there every day not us or politicians!!!!,borders are defended
Well said!!,Democrats turning their backs on their own constituents, the poor, the working class...... Well the American ones.  Only a Democrat would stick their neck out for everyone but Americans.  Those already here who need government assistance in any form should be opposed to open borders. They will be bankrupting the very programs they depend on and stealing your children’s seats in the classroom.
Not new. Clinton did 17,Obama 13. Where were you,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
GOD BLESS YOU!,GOD BLESS YOU!
Beverly Hurst Smith you know you really should know your history and how Congress and the Senate works we did not have the votes in the Senate hello are you there is anybody home in that head of yours,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
The calling of names is disgusting, immature and non-productive.  some of you people need to seriously grow up.,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.

Denise Foot You get your words from mainstream media. It couldn't be more obvious. Who are your experts?  "vanity wall?" And please tell us what is the "plan" for border security?  The politicians you trust so much have created the situation at that border and they don't wish to fix it!  Don't be so naïve.,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Denise Foot Those aren't lies.  You don't get out much or know many people?  Immigration has been a problem for decades. Illegal migration is created by politicians and always has been. It's a huge problem.   All that California governor is going to have is slave labor and wealthy people and an overpopulation of poor people.  Ever see the homeless situation in southern California?,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Denise Foot I'm not wallowing in lies from anyone. YOu are naïve. I know exactly what's been going on in California for decades. I don't need anyone to tell me that.  I don't have to "read" anything about what I said either.  The previous governor Jerry Brown and the new one, Gaven Newsom do nothing but ruin California and if you can't see that , then maybe you should go there and learn a few things.  I don't need Donald Trump or anyone else but the people who actually live it in that state to tell me what those stupid politicians have allowed for over 30 years. My statements are true. YOU are naïve.  And don't call me a fool when you obviously know much of nothing about the situation in California. Take a trip and get outside of your own comfort zone, lady. Try learning real things and talk to real people.  YOur term "vanity wall" is a media term.  Don't you have your own words?,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Denise Foot They did fund the wall last year, dear.  They are using that money right now by repairing and replacing parts of the 700 miles of  wall / fencing that is already there.  They ALL voted for it not so long ago. YOu should keep up on current events.,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
It's called "objectivity."  "Rational and critical thought.",Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Denise Foot Laughing at the facts? I see you are just ignorant. Good luck with that.  Have you ever been to California or Texas?,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Denise Foot I didn't go only by what Trump said. Can't you research anything? You just laugh at everything instead.  There's 700 miles of border wall/fence already there!  Are you totally ignorant or what?  They have been repairing sections and replacing some too. Nancy Pelosi said it when she tried to deny it!  She said...."no new wall is being built, they are repairing sections of what's there and replacing some."   REPLACING some!  You are out of touch and think that laughing at things is rational.,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Too few understand and are unaware that the left is destabilizing the country for overthrow and subversion. Just today, rising democrat 'star" Beto O'Rourke stated that the US Constitution is an outdated document that should be replaced, and Elizabeth Warren said that the electoral college should be destroyed and replaced by mob rule (aka democracy). In 1958 an FBI agent wrote a book called 'The Naked Communist'. In this book he listed 45 communist goals for overthrowing the United States. One of the rules was: "Instill the idea that the US Constitution is outdated and a product of it's time". This was written 60 years ago. This is why the left is trying to disarm patriots. Too few are understanding the big picture. The left is dismantling the USA and it will be replaced by a communist dictatorship.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Randy Johnson The uneducated garbage is really old. Evidently you don't know many educated people. There are plenty who support him because they don't like the thought of communism.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Melissa Ann democrats and a few uncomparable Republicans. Our Presidents got this..,Doing what's needed to have been done for DECADES....
Jess Castrejón MAD is a group who does address this #MOTHERSAGAINSTDRUNKDRIVERS.,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
Many States have a 2x - 3rd jail. It helps until someone gets out. It's an addiction and needs treated as such. But it takes like all addictions. The addict has to work hard at staying sober for life. It's a decision with prayers. Illegals need to stay out of America period. They should be tried for murder ..,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem.

So Pelosi states "NO" prior to the speech. She and her group want the Gov't opened, then they will proceed to "talk". Let's see now: You loan me $500,000 now, and later we will "talk" & I will agree to sign the Contract, well maybe and maybe NOT. Hilarious ! Or is there a problem with what sits above the neck on the LEFT ? That is an assumption that others are as dumb as you are.,Pelosi has Alcoholic Dementia, she needs to go to rehab!!!! That's a start to securing our borders.
Yes CNN ABC WAsh Post NY Times have polls of 788 people, 475 people, and other  silly polls...when there is 325 million that live in the USA. So Pelosi states "NO" prior to the speech. She and her group want the Gov't opened, then they will proceed to "talk". Let's see now: You loan me $500,000 now, and later we will "talk" & I will agree to sign the Contract, well maybe and maybe NOT. Hilarious !

We might need a wall around Ca for the protection of Americans.,I say let them have shithole Cali and shithole ny and build walls around those too.

Brent Robinson First off, Trumps approval rating is of his own making. Secondly everything in your post is right from the Republican Party playbook.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down.

Bill Johnson more importantly he cares about golf!,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Buck Strunk  I guess you never heard of the EU.,No other country has open borders why should we
Jonathan Schremp  Speaking of defense-Trump’s choice of lawyers was bad. He would have been better off with Frito Pendejo.,God Bless you President Trump! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
Ron Gagnon  In this great emergency, Trump decided to play golf.,Sheikh F Shahel hello
Davita Levao Really?  Read the Good Book...KJV... Ephesians 5:5. ..there is no room in the kingdom of God for a whoremonger,And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.             Thank you Jesus for Trump and Pence.
Well that and he endorsed Hillary for President !!  😆 🇺🇸 MAGA,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Edward Dennis Toppe . Everyone that I know has voted for trump,How can these libtards go on national tv..and lie..they offer no facts..no numbers..none!! Then they call our president a liar.. he is inducing panic and manufacturing   fear...??? How are they allowed to just flat out lie like that to the people!!!??
Only reason Obama won..was because he ran against two morons. And their true colors have  been seen,How can these libtards go on national tv..and lie..they offer no facts..no numbers..none!! Then they call our president a liar.. he is inducing panic and manufacturing   fear...??? How are they allowed to just flat out lie like that to the people!!!??
Rod if you ever had any doubt if you are an ASSHOLE. I can confirm that you are an ASSHOLE. CONGRATULATIONS.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kathleen Reilly Mallia were not the ones that have a problem, so why should we leave? Lol,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
How so, President Trump won the election according to the rules of the US Constitution.  He is delivering on his campaign promises as few president have done before him in spite of a coordinated and constant attack on him by the establishment in the DC government, the News media and the Entertainment Industry.  20 years from now he will be remembered as an effective president after all of the current rancor is forgotten.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lori Godines so your saying people who have worked for their money can’t do what they want with it.   That is so un-American!   Lori I to believe you shouldn’t be able to cross our border at will.  I believe in border  security.  This Moron we have as a president has chosen to go about things that get people like you who are ignorant to the facts to act out like you just have.  And that is truly the problem!   Illegal immigration is a problem that is easily solved.  Make it a felony to hire anyone who isn’t here legally and illegal immigration would be solved over night.   Why isn’t this done ?   Our country would come to a screeching halt.  You may find this hard to believe, especially with your extra chromosome and all, but why isn’t it a crime to hire an illegal immigrant !!  Our food supply depends on migrant workers.   Sensible and comprehensive immigration reform is needed!   Trumps a moron and his days are numbered, so it won’t happen under his administration!,Shut the whole border down! Stop all money transfers to Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala!
,Shut the whole border down! Stop all money transfers to Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala!
Wendy Anne it so nice to see people with an extra chromosome participating in the comments.  😊,Thank you. We appreciate you and support you.
😂😂😂😂🤔,No other country has open borders why should we
Stan Piznarski he is a terrible deal maker, it’s all a fraud!  More importantly he is either going to back down on China or eclair he made a deal, but it will be a deal that weakens America.  I don’t ask you agree, I understand your support and I support you as an American.  Please scrutinize whatever deal he makes with China though, don’t just believe “it’s great” because he says so.  The future of America relies on it.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

It would take a really Stupid person too believe Trump would be anyone's Agent or Puppet , Trump not as a Business Man and for sure not as the Most Powerful Man on the Planet , You leftist morons need to think before you Type , Speak or even breed !  Trump Has a Big Ego , Oh Trump's A Puppet ,   Trump Stupid ""  YET Trump  is worth 3.5 Billion dollars and Liberals are only good and taxing other Americans !,Says the Russian agent.
Kevin Couture all I see from you is that your only uneducated comments are name calling. I'm guessing you're way too stupid to have an adult conversation. You're a typical unintelligent liberal.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Heather Hegge gee Heather, why is his administration wasting time on doing it then.  Sit down, your cognitive dissonance is showing.,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.

Barbara Anderson oh man, again I asked a question, and now my upbringing, reproductive organs, and intentions are being questioned.  It is easy to be an asshole, and I’m good at being one, but that was not the intent here.  I asked a question.,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Linda Lail no, I didn’t.  What’s your point?,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.

Jamie Hammack also, check out the responses to my question.  People are insulting my family, including my dead grandmother, a few cousins (who I might add have struggled with weight issues, and one who is somewhat ability impaired), and my sister.  You wanna talk about belittling, address those from “your party” who think that behavior is acceptable.     INSULTING MY DEAD GRANDMOTHER.  Let that sink in.,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Jamie Hammack read my original post.  This is about Trump editing his appearance to appear more fit on social media.  I’m sorry, but his entire existence is mired in falsehoods, and his social media team editing his appearance to make him more attractive is yet another way of manipulating people into thinking he is something that he is not.    So by my asking the question of why he feels the need to do that I’m belittling others who are overweight?  That’s a stretch bro.  By “my party” I’m assuming you mean “Democrats”.

Janey Renteria Keep drinking the Kool-Aid!,The Democrats attack is on the middle class. They want open borders to flood the work market So they can lower our wages. And to punish us for voting for Trump! Stay strong Mr. President!
Brent Robinson , what if the Mexicans decided to build stairs on their side of the wall?,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.

To tell the whole truth, the 1.4 million you mention, 98% are from cop self defense, suicide and good Samaritans saving theirs and others lives. Yep, 2% are all that can be called problem killings by criminals. Ask how many gun deaths France and Britain have. It 8lis far higher because only bad guys have guns.   The bottom line is you do not trust your fellow Americans to have the same power as everyone else. U want to disarm us, so you can control us. This is not your fault. Liberals teach this because they are also afraid. I am sorry you have to spend your life cowering in fear. I am sorry you believe Pelosi and Clinton who are protected by armed guards everywhere they go. What's good for them, you do not deserve because u are their subjects.,I love that Donald J. Trump is working to protect Americans and he is acknowledging these angel parents to help them heal. ❤ May their children's deaths not be in vain.

Blanca Gonzalez very sorry ma'am! God Bless you and yours.,An illegal killed my dad years ago..
Attached is a link to official Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) statistics on border apprehensions for our Northern, coastal, and Southern borders for FY 2000 - 2017. Total apprehensions in FY 2017 were approx 20% of what they were in FY 2000. However, our current president says the stats HE HAS from CBP indicates an increase: https://www.cbp.gov/,And young white American citizens cause a thousand times more destruction. Besides, there was no intention in your brothers death, it was an accident. I am sorry for your loss, but blanket statements that equate an isolated incident to mass murder is ludicrous. Immigrants are not killing us, our own citizens are.
Idiot,you mean a wall?
Smith Helen Jessica, you're a moron.,June Norrell who me? Or him? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8AAMho5cUxHl28zc1H--jEKUDteyuX7/view
Marcos Ramirez thank Obama for 17 trillion of that 👌,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Now Arliss when you "count" do you just use your fingers or do you take off your shoes and use the toes as well?,Stand Strong. The people who count are with you!
Hell of a lot more good old fashion Americans doing everything you rant about.,My heart and prayers go out to all the victims! And if you think about it ,aren't all legal hard working Americans victims? They come here and abuse our law and order, our resources , our job opportunities, our taxes that should be used to benefit Americans who are struggling! They broke our laws and we are paying the price.  Build that wall!
Well I live in Arizona and I'm not.,Well complacency is the leading cause of not being prepared 👍🏼
So you are a hypocrite.,We will only be closer to a Nation until the Non American democrats defeat you and us Deplorables. I Pray for God to help you restore USA 🇺🇸 and bring Pelosi and Schumer under His Control for the BETTER of All People. 🙏🇺🇸
And since you do you are immoral also?,I find any democrat that has keys to their homes, cars, tool sheds. garages, motor cycles, Gym lockers, to be immoral citizens.
Deb Galarza Deb since you live nowhere near the border and have no idea what really happens here why should we give a damn about what you want?,We want the Wall but the Dems don't look like they care what we want or what's best for our Country.  These people should not be in office. They are acting so childish and petty. I say we get rid of them and replace with more reasonable people!
Why is it that people like you who live nowhere near the boarder have you panties in a knot?,Stephen Pierson   Another brilliant saying from another dummy crat
No the life blood of America is it people, all kinds of people,Absolutely. This is the lifeblood of our nation: SECURITY.
Thank him for what? Another worthless pledge?,Thank you Mr President 👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Jeanne this isn't The Apprentice, he can't fire anybody in the Congress.,Build the wall. Pay the hard working federal employees asap so they can feed their families. Also fire the committee members that decided not to pay our coast guard and homeland security. YES I KNOW HE CAN'T LITERALLY FIRE CONGRESS MEMBERS.
Karen Harvey No Karen it is fact. You know just not liking facts does not change them or make them disappear, unless of course you are a trumpie.,From your statement it would seem that you are not one of the intelligent ones, right?
Omar Martinez Well Omar if you can't figure out a few simple sentences what can I say?,From your statement it would seem that you are not one of the intelligent ones, right?
Kevin you might have missed this but you are an idiot,Having a strong, secure border without a wall is like trying to have a strong, superior military without weapons!
Lisa sorry but your "we" is a rapidly shrinking minority, . Didn't you get the memo?,John Decker  maybe you should read the comments
Hypocrite,Build that wall...save lives on both sides.....IN GOD WE TRUST - IN TRUMP WE BELIEVE...Amen...
Tell us Michael what is it like being in a shrinking minority?,Keep it up, Mr. President.  We are with you.  Law & Order, sovereignty
So that makes you a far  right nut job?,Nancy is NOT working for the American people. She is working for the far leftist nut jobs trying to destroy our country. Stand firm Mr. President.
And how in the hell would you know? Do you stand at the boarder and count?,Over stayed Visas is a bunch of bull.  50,000 a month cross through Texas, New Mexico, California and Arizona undetected every month.
your paranoia and bigotry are showing.,Josh your right, but this is no longer about money. The one side hates the other side and will do what ever is needed to destroy our POTUS. Like it or not he's our leader, he beat 16 Republicans and Hillary to get this position. Like it or not, Trump won.
Why should they?So Trump can build a worthless wall?,Use your power and build the wall. Clearly the dems will not concead
Yes and just like Trump Mortgage, Trump University, Trump Casinos he is rapidly bankrupting America too. Some businessman.,Where is he bankrupting us. just because he wants to spend and make thing right. look at the debt Obama left us.
Then you are a hypocrite.,God Bless you Mr President! We do appreciate all you are doing for our us and country. Keep up the good work. Keep moving forward. ❤️🇺🇸💙
Do you think that this is still The Apprentice?,John Decker What does apprentice have to do with it,by the way it was a show with huge success
We don't need any more voters, we are the majority right now you pin head,John Decker Mob Rule Rocks! and Let's throw in Sharia Law and Democratic Socialism. I'm All In!
From your statement it would seem that you are not one of the intelligent ones, right?,Donald J. Trump Please stay tied hard and fast on the Border Wall.  Most all intelligent Americans realize your positive stand against Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the Democrat Socialist is a  Life and Death stand of Good Republicans  vs Evil Democrat Socialists.

Illegal immigration is at a 10 year low and there is no extra money going towards vets.,Vets before wall.
Tudy Anderson Latulip a wall will not stop the illegal handouts and instantly relocate that money to vets. A wall will take decades to build and vets should not have to wait.,Vets before wall.
Looks like America will be hiring mexican( qualified) workers for air traffic control jobs at half price. This might trouble retired controllers because pensions will be in jeopardy because future employees will not be paying in for retirement. LOL,John Fortney funny. Some of the young Controllers in training or newly certified are worried about missing a pay check. The whole damn thing is a shitshow, but that's nothing new, is it.   If it is truly a Emergency then Trump should declare or be derelict in his duties. Other than that it's a desperate act of a desperate man.
Steve Swisher my point was it could be worse. I understand when people work for or under the government it kidda dictates their thought process. Glad I'm not relying on the government just paying for it. Your welcome.,John Fortney funny. Some of the young Controllers in training or newly certified are worried about missing a pay check. The whole damn thing is a shitshow, but that's nothing new, is it.   If it is truly a Emergency then Trump should declare or be derelict in his duties. Other than that it's a desperate act of a desperate man.
what the Dem abortions,How many children have been killed by Americans?
Yes the problem is bigger than the Illegals,  1 big bite will be a start.,So let me get this straight.....  Only Mexicans are in our prison system for murdering?  Please correct me if I’m wrong.  So y’all only care about people killed by Mexicans and not by Americans?   Again, please correct me if I’m wrong.  But guess what...  I KNOW BETTER.  Your are not wanting more brown people in this country.    MAKE AMERICA WHITE AGAIN!!!!!
No they should have stayed in home country.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Really ! What planet did you float in from,U might want to look at your gun problem as something requiring the recognition of a national emergency before letting a wall jump the que... u do know thats not the only way they get in?
Temicka Brown That's what the Dems did with the money Trump gave,So what makes you think a damn wall will keep out illegals?
Michelle Helderman and if you use the Bible, remember it says not to commit adultery like trump, don’t steal like trump, be a righteous man unlike trump, love thy neighbors unlike trump, be humble, help the sick, help the poor, etc etc.,let me know when you see it...... 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 King James Version (KJV)  51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  King James Version (KJV)
Michelle Helderman stop letting your  faith lead you so blindly, use you head not a bible,let me know when you see it...... 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 King James Version (KJV)  51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

George E Simpkins Jr actually there were 323 mass shootings since trump’s presidency.,Sheldon Satchel who are you? who or whatever you are, you certainly have fooled a lot of white people but you haven’t fooled black Americans! I hope Russia is paying you well Pal!
Ed Barnat grow up.,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
Additionally I have also sent a message to Nancy Pelosi telling her to put an end to this mess and compromise with you for the wall.  But then again no one is actually gonna listen on their end.  I don’t claim to know all the answers but I do know that we must end the government shutdown now and I know that the Democrats must compromise with you and make a deal.  Instead the Democrats are just dividing America further.,I deeply respect you Mr. President and everything you’re doing to keep America safe and deal with the border crisis and thank you for everything you have done for us combat veterans.  I sincerely appreciate everything you’ve done I really do.    But please end the government shutdown there are people suffering because of it, there are government employees who have families who can’t even afford to buy groceries because of the government shutdown and all of the partisan bickering.  Not to mention the rest of the damage being done to the country because of this government shutdown.  Although since Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the Democrats refuse to compromise and deal with you they are just as responsible for this government shutdown now if not more responsible for the government shutdown because they will not compromise.    You have a lot of us who are behind you and support you including myself but please don’t let Nancy Pelosi and Schumer use this shutdown against you.  Please put an end to the government shutdown for the greater good of the country and maybe give the Democrats something they want most to get them to compromise on this and so you can get funding for the wall.  I don’t know I honestly don’t have all the answers and right now the government is in crisis it’s really a sever catch 22 right now.  All I can say for sure is that this government shutdown must end.    I’ve never seen America so divided before and it honestly makes me sad to see my country that I love so much so divided.  We need to unite America again somehow.    God bless you Mr. President we are behind you we support you but please find a way to reopen the government before further damage is done.  I wish you well and I wish your Presidency to be successful sir, God bless you and God bless America!

Marion Sorel Trump is doing what we the American people voted for him to do...Build The Wall!,Even a 4 legged animal is smart enough to know when they are boxed in a corner however, instinct tells them to change their path.  Trump is too self serving to realize he has MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF!!!!

Dave Thompson what are you even babbling about?,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels’ hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy’s and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.

Joel Bernardini yet he kept the umpa lumpa orange.  How Malania deals with that ... oh for the money.  The first hooker to become 1st “lady”.,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Bahahahahah!. No. That's what Trump did to Obummer!. All his actions are gone!!!. Thank you, President Trump!. You're thee Greatest president ever!!. You were legally and legitimately voted into office!. Unlike Odumbass, as a non American, Muslim, who hated this great nation, we love that you love this great country!!,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Danny, the perp you cite is unfortunately one of us and we are left to deal with these kinds of things as a community through legal channels. The perp who took this man’s daughter should never have been here and, given serious, intellectually honest and bipartisan action to secure our border bring sanity back to our immigration enforcement process, likely would not have removed her from our midst.   Sorry for your loss.,Another American killed my friend. Is her death any less important than an illegal killing another American?
Jason McElweenie Works for me!,There is no doubt that Pelosi will reject the President's latest offer. That being the case I would:   Immediately proclaim a national crisis and get the military building barriers.  Secondly, I would let ICE loose. By that I would have them raid thousands of businesses and immediately deport any illegals found. As a nice measure I would give a 1 week notice that these raids are about to begin. Thirdly, along with deportation I would arrest either the hiring HR director, or if no one fits that description, arrest the front line supervision for hiring illegals.   Lastly, I would implement a 25% fee on ANY monies wired to Mexico and Central America.   If the President would implement a get tough program I would guess Pelosi would come begging to finally get this immigration issue solved once and for all. This crap needs to end.
Brian Lee  I remember Viet nam well. Your kind was crying we had no biz being there and bring the boys home was your battle cry. And now you are all butthurt because someone didn't go. Smh  58,420(approx) names on the wall who's families wish they had not gone either,A 5 times draft dodger fight???
Brian Lee  You ask why we were in nam...I've never figured that out.  We didn't belong there to begin with. It was nothing but a killing field and the  Biggest waste of lives and money ever.  Why so touchy snowflake? Just because I don't condemn someone for not going to a bullshit police action that cost so many lives? So you sit down and shut your pie hole,A 5 times draft dodger fight???
Kevin E Hölmeş  One killed our daughter. That % is too high for me no matter what it is,What % of violent crimes are committed by immigrants?  I'll wait while you research the answer to this dog whistle  *files nails*

Lisa Duarte-Garcia lol what the hell does that have to do with anything? It's about trying to fix the problems many promised but just said it for election votes. That's what you are seeing now, and honestly I don't really seeing anyone sneaking into Mexico or Venezuela or an other south american country unless they are trying to hide. Every country has its own killers, child molesters that are probably allowed to do it because child marriage is still legal some areas, and all that etc..etc..etc. is available anywhere. Maybe a wall will or will not have an impact, but we won't know till we try. I mean it works for most countries,Your an ignorant man, it doesn’t matter if you build a wall.  It will not stop American Born serial killers, drug dealers/users, rapist, murderers, bigots, child molesters, etc., etc., from being in this country.  As long as the demands stay in the USA the supply will keep coming
Maria Gambrelli it's called adaptation, glad you have a sense of humor gonna need it when the Truth is revealed.

Adam Watts After the great negotiator failed to get mexico to pay for the wall, how did he fail got get funding when he had all three branches of govt? LOL,The Democrats are  just like spoiled children they would rather see this country get over run with criminals drug dealers and terrorist then to help the American people .most are so jealous of trump beating Hillary they will do anything and everything to sabotage his presidency including ruining this country just so they can get what they want it' not about helping it's about control
After the great negotiator failed to get mexico to pay for the wall, how did he fail got get funding when he had all three branches of govt? LOL. fools,Build the wall... !!!!!!!!!!! I love my country n my president!!! Go Trump!!!!!!!
the morons are the ones that believed mexico was going to pay for it.  We laughed at you then and we're laughing now!,John Scott No one cares what you think! We we are laughing at you for rigging everything for Hillary and she still got crushed. So shut up and get back to your safe space moron. Bite me!
Fools After the great negotiator failed to get mexico to pay for the wall, how did he fail got get funding when he had all three branches of govt? LOL,We want a WALL, TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
thanks for posting a book,John Scott  I'm telling my story to educate the American people and President Trump. This only touches the iceberg. The wall has to be built to protect Americans.
The way Obama got Obama care was by lying his ass off an having the dumbocrats ram it down out throats,  "We have to pass it to know what's in it" says Pelosi.  That's the way he got Obamacare you dumb ass.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Would it only be illegal immigrants that would ransack his house? because no Americans would ever commit a crime 🙄 moron,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Does God not like Mexico then? Is he only helping America?,No one but this great man could withstand the abuse and the lack of support and still accomplish the unthinkable. You’re a warrior, sir. We thank you and we love you. God is with you🙏💙. In my 74 years, no one even comes close🇺🇸

Shutting down the government and causing the severe grief of 800,000 people is hardly an accomplishment.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Debbie Hudson Debbie, first of all, open the government to stop hurting Americans by holding them hostage.  Then, analyze the border to identify the various issues associated with various segments of the border. Take the segments or issues presenting the greatest risk. Review those segments or issues to ID the best solution approaches. Fund those solution approaches. Then iterate thru lower priorities until the pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  There are big problems that a wall will do nothing to solve: 1) most of the illegal drugs that enter our great country across the southern border come in on vehicles driving thru existing, managed and legal ports of entry, 2) the next most prevalent entry method is via tunnels under existing wall, 3) about 40% of folk currently in our country illegally came in with valid visas but overstayed those visas (these folk come from all over the world) and 4) it is reported that currently, the visa overstay issue is contributing higher volumes of people in country illegally than the volume of people crossing across the southern border.  Trump is actually hurting the cause of enhancing border security by using the false siren call of “the wall”. This is both dumb and counterproductive. If he wanted true progress, he would lead the process towards smart and effective enhancements in a prioritized way.  Debbie, I watched Trump state he would be happy and proud to shut it down. I watched Trump state he would own the shutdown, completely.  I watched this on live TV - no “fake news” spin involved.  Trump had signaled he would sign the funding bills. McConnell had the Senate vote on the funding bills based upon that understanding.  That same night, extreme right wing media personalities criticized Trump. Trump caved to the criticism (so much for being strong).  Then the House added Trump’s money into their version of the bill and passed it.  Then the shutdown started.  Then, the new House passed the exact same funding bills that had just been passed, almost unanimously, three or so weeks before. Now, McConnell refuses to bring those same bills for a vote in the new Congress, enabling Trump.  Trump is acting IMMORALLY when he hurts over one million Americans as his sole “negotiating” chip.,No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.   STOP hurting our own citizens - it is IMMORAL.
Nick Brown Nick, I am the author of these remarks thus I can copy and paste it to any simple-minded propaganda spin message posted by Trump.  Trump in The Art of the Deal: “I play to people’s fantasies.”  Takes a big man to gaslight his country...l.,No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.

Betsy Hammond We spend $150 billion per year on illegal immigrants welfare. Even if wall only stopped half of it, that's $75 billion per year that can go towards the things you speak of. Can you imagine how far that can go? WOW!!!! You're not just real bright are you?,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.
,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.

Barbara Balding Garlic it's a 3-prong approach. It's strategically placed and not coast to coast so why can't you compromise on it?,Matt Farus interviews with landowners in Texas show they will fight it.
Drew Mullen question if you please...do you vote in primaries? Have you ever caucused?,Exactly! The role of government is to protect its people!
Frank Eie seriously. That is a negotiating tactic with Mexico. It is cost effective and will pay for itself with less people to process.,Joni Preuss No, that was certainly an unfulfilled campaign promise.  "we are going to build a wall...and who is going to pay for it". then you replied...Mexico is going to pay for it!  Come on...you remember!
Hugo Konigs seriously. That is a negotiating tactic with Mexico. It is cost effective and will pay for itself with less people to process.,wow, theres even a trademarked term now! and you almost have a dozen as your poster children. about 20 veterans commit suicide EACH DAY. thats a real problem. try to build a wall for that you moron

Jennifer Yvonne Croff then maybe a American drunk driver would hit her. What then,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.

Alyssa Taylor he was drunk. But like I said this was a drunk idiot problem, and has nothing to do with Mexicans.

Alyssa Taylor and I’m not saying whose fault it is. Does it really matter to the dead person whose fault it is? If I have the right of way at the intersection and someone hits me and kills me - I’m still just as dead. No matter whose fault it is.,Wendi DelValle if a white guy would’ve done the same thing, would you be wanting to banish white dudes from the country? Sorry for the loss of your brother.

That is dangerous because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in other people’s minds about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy.” It’s worth noting that America is not a democracy, but I digress.🤡  "Dims" spent the next two years blaming Russia hacked the election🤡,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.

Mike J Knifong Not only are you arguing against what Mexico states, but you are also arguing against your own narrative  sorry peanut you can't have it both ways😂 walls paid for https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/247649-no-mr-trump-mexico-is-not-killing-us-on-trade?fbclid=IwAR3syMh1o2pB7MPNxm0Q3B27WoPNcer5S5galT_g2KqqrCckujfoz3IVzb4,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Asha Artis the innocent illegal I guess. Bet you would feel differently if this was your kid. Bet you would be calling for the end of illegal immigration also. https://fox17.com/news/local/undocumented-immigrant-snuck-into-lebanon-home-raped-6-year-old-girl,The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!
Jacqueline Alas laws against murder already on the books and enforced. We are demanding the remainder of our laws are enforced. What is so controversial about that? Why is that so difficult to comprehend.,An American just murdered 5 Americans and this is his focus 🤦🏻‍♀️
Except for the fact that, you know, a wall would of prevented it....,This is a very sad story.  Too bad it has nothing to do with a stupid wall.
Kris Landers hyperbole? Seriously? Its not. Also, what are you trying to say about illegals? That you shouldn't befriend them because they will rape your children? That's not very tolerant of you, is it?,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Kris Landers we are not saying citizenship status is the reason it happened. That's not the argument. The argument is, that will proper enforcement, this person would of never been in the country, and this tragedy would of been prevented. I hope that brings clarity.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

Mexico is paying for the wall. USMCA trade agreement. It's not enough to complete it. Unless you voted for Trump his campaign promises are of no concern to you. You're campaign promises are in Godzillary's book currently on sale in the bargin bin at barns and noble. Stop acting like Trump owes you anything. You wasted your vote on a 2 time loser.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
fake news better than no news,Ya my tax dollars going for a wall thats not going to stop them
Lenny Anders trump is trying to tote this "solution" as a cure to the problem america has with 67 billion a year in drugs or more coming over the border. He's trying to say it is going to slow illegal immigrants. It will not help. The wall in isreal did not help with terrorism it stopped regular people from crossing into their territory's. You know what did help, having America spend 38 billion on isreals military and other operations in the region. You sit there pretending you know why people stopped trying to bomb isreal its more likely because if you approach the fence and try to climb over you could be met with LETHAL force. If you intend on killing refugees and people seeking work in your country then maybe numbers will drop.,Haha most who supports the wall seem to be in late 50-60s with no actual understanding of how it works.
The real problem with people over staying their visa's are the people who say nothing if they know someone who is over staying their visa's.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?

What a joke, the guy cant make a simple point about his country losing it's identity without it turning into a race issue.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Rick Sooy His promise was that MEXICO would pay for it!,Josh your right, but this is no longer about money. The one side hates the other side and will do what ever is needed to destroy our POTUS. Like it or not he's our leader, he beat 16 Republicans and Hillary to get this position. Like it or not, Trump won.
Anyone gots facts?,How much does it cost tax payers for just one year to support the illegals we have now?
No one knows?,How much does it cost tax payers for just one year to support the illegals we have now?
thanks for info,How much does it cost tax payers for just one year to support the illegals we have now?
Anyone know about how much it costs to support illegals we have right now for a year?,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
Ruben Radar Rodriguez well said! Thank you for your sacrifice.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

It would. Americans are sick of the illegals, sick of the corruption, sick of seeing our war veterans treated like crap, sick of Obamacare, sick of the deception and lies of the Democrats, and if Congress doesn't want to do their job, then fire them and we'll handle it ourselves with our President,In my observations, President Trump, we aren't facing Democrats anymore. We are facing off against evil, itself.   There have been jokes circulating, that if you gave a public address stating that oxygen is good for us, they would all suffocate themselves to try and slander you.   I am starting to believe this, however, because all they do is try to stop you from protecting Americans and our country.   Here is what I suggest, if Congress will not fund the border wall, begin selling the bricks to us Americans. Design some kind of order form, and we will purchase the bricks.   I am willing to work OT, to buy as many of those bricks, as I can afford.   We the people stood behind you, to beat Hillary. You think we won't do it again, against a Democrat, cry-baby congress?

We had well guarded borders before the Trump Shutdown occurred. Thanks to Trump for leaving the borders unsecured and open. Now just about about anyone armed can pass through the gates at our airports. Remember how Osama bin laden got into the country and planned the attacks ok n 9/11?  May as well just reopen the government and put more armed security to work. Because right now we have open borders because of Trump.,No other country has open borders why should we

Kathy Bezner why don't you pay up and build one and quit telling everyone that a wall is needed. The Trump had three years to fund the wall with a Republican dominated H.O.R and Senate and he didn't do anything. Now all of a sudden we Liberals and Democrats are being blamed for no wall? Let me remind you that he promised Mexico would pay for it and he couldn't force Mexico to pay up. So NO WALL!!! WHATSOEVER!!!,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!

Lynn Limauro Floyd How many people have been murdered by Illegal immigrants VERSUS How many people have been murdered by white Americans let’s say in the last 10 years?,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Curtis Rice your a jerk,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Pourk Hammur your a jerk,Yesterday, there was a National Emergency.... Today, you're hanging out, playing golf, stuffing your gullet with hot dogs.... There's no "National Emergency" or "border crisis", you're not fooling anybody except your inbred, mouth-breathing base...
Jeff Rockwell you can cite poll after poll.  Anyone can manipulate polls to say what they want.  Trump ran on building a wall and won big....the people want a wall.  I am sick to death of people worrying more about people who are here illegally than they do about American citizens, and I am tired of paying for them.  If you believe walls don’t work, tell Obama, Pelosi and even the Pope to take down their walls.,Stephen Pierson actually, the majority DO want the wall.  You’re listening to fake news again.

Bobby Wilson call pelosi and tell her!!,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
We're also allowed to SHOOT intruders.  Too many liberals and bleeding hearts. Ohh just tap their hands,  say don't do that,  and let them go. What a joke.,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
A wall is a tool in MANY necessary steps to fix this issue.  Period. It's a deterrant, not a fix all.,There are many ways to fix the immigration system. You are unwilling to listen to all of the options you insist on a wall
That was your last Potus...,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
Stephen Pierson Majority DOES !! Get your facts right,Agree need wall, but don't keep punishing the working class to get it.  If shutdown keeps going, the next thing we'll face is a major Recession.   No money to pay bills, let alone buy anything or even go out to eat.  Use your executive order and end the shutdown
Obviously... ILLEGAL ALIENS 👽👽😂🤣😂🤣,Aliens exists and the government knows
She's an evil BITCH... simple,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them. We see this in the recent drama from Buzzfeed.

Hal Eric Mitlitsky every single president has declared a national emergency, usually to protect foreign countries, time to protect ours.,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Tom Murphy too late for that, though. The wall is simply going up.  It’s already been started,Juan Adamo must be private contractors doing it since the government isn't getting anything done these days. Even private guys will stop working when the cheques stop flowing though.
Buck Strunk Not True. Almost all of Europe has appendix border. I will be in Switzerland and all I need is a Visa. Do not talk if you do not know. You are an ignorant.,No other country has open borders why should we
Not even a shoe of the wrong size will fit by force,Triumph comes not by force but by wisdom. A strong wave will bring ruin to what it touches but in its wake you've discovered a cleansing of the shores...

Ron O'Hearn but where's the exaggeration and fear mongering?,How many legal citizens kill people in the United states daily?

You are so right.  She needs fired.  Such a hate filled person.,Republican Congressmen and Republican Senators, all Republicans, need to forget Nancy and hound all the other democratic Congressmen and Senators.  Work on them and they'll do something about Nancy Pelosi.  Pelosi needs to be reminded of who it is she works for and that she is NOT the president....not even close.

So true,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Chrisopher Hernandez,  What is the answer?,Duh! We all want border security but a dumb wall is not the answer .
Mark Glass,  I see, a class act you are not.  Don’t be so bitter just because no one wants to grab yours.,Judy Conrad well I’d be an acceptable pick for president for you still.

Sam North yup,A legal citizen shot and killed 5 Americans yesterday.
Roy..a nice bubble bath and fuzzy robe and slippers possibly could help ...huggy,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
And most were registered Democrats let that sink in.,Did you hear about Aurora illinois shooting yesterday asshole? Guess what, he was legal and with a felony and somehow he bought a gun.  How your stupid wall is going to solve that ?
I'm sorry for your loss,An illegal killed my dad years ago..
Hahaha MSM hahaha,Trump lies for example in the sotu he said one out of three women in the caravans are molested.    The mainstream media looked into it and found trump lied.     Only 31 percent of women in the caravans were found to be molested!  Impeach trump and lock him up!
Gary Kane , you must not have watched yesterday.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Yes we have enough crazy here in the US, don't need to import more garbage.,In Chicago every 14 mins somebody is getting shot. The man who created the massacre in Las Vegas? All these shooters are "legal Americans"
Temicka Brown no your democrat plantation doesn't care about you, try and keep up.,So what makes you think a damn wall will keep out illegals?
Stupid,If you’re going to build a wall on the border with Mexico, wouldn’t you also build walls on both coasts and our border with Canada? And if you do that, wouldn’t make sense just to isolate ourselves from the world, cease all trade and just curl up into a ball and ignore the realities of life? LOL at the WALL. #SmokeAndMirrors
Donald J. Trump,Please stop the goverment shutdown i need things from the irs to start school i have to start feb 25th if they dont open by then i wont be able to start school.
Kris Landers sorry the wall will prevent further loss of funds why do they want to come here Free healthcare , jobs schools oh and don’t forget birth right citizenship are all opportunity that should be for green card holders and sponsored workers etc .,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

James McCaskill there’s a lock on my house, but if someone wanted to get in, they could. The border is no different. I don’t have a fence around my house. One isn’t needed because if someone wanted to come over it to break into my house, they would. The fence wouldn’t stop them, but I’d be out a lot of money. See the similarities?  The only way to keep out intruders would be with other methods, like a watchdog or obvious cameras. The point is, there are more effective methods.,Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets. But if you listen to mainstream media or the Democrats nothing wrong with our borders.
they both looked like something from a horror movie with their creepy eyes!,Notice how Schumer looks us in the eyes, but did not look the president in the eyes in the meeting a few weeks ago! And Shcumer lies, so does Pelosi! Happy that you mentioned that many congressional and Hollywood types have walls around their homes Keep the shut down, build the wall!

Smith Helen Jessica if you let a Russian in the voting booth with you that is your stupidity. The American citizens voted for Donald Trump.  No Russians were in the booth with them. Live in your fairytale Russian collusion that they put Trump into office.  The only ties to Russia is the fake dossier paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign, which was used to open an investigation. I do not give a crap about anything Manafort did.  The citizens of the United States voted but the democrats cannot accept the election of Donald Trump.,June Norrell who me?

I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Norene Boone  all well and good when we had people in the Government willing to do there job . It’s not his wall it’s the people’s wall digbat,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Natalie Halem pay attention mam... The Democrats are not going to give OUR PRESIDENT ANY SUPPORT ...THAT'S RIGHT HE IS YOUR PRESIDENT TOO!!!,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage
Anthony Conrod LoL I’ve been called a bot or Russian so many times I’ve lost count. Everyone is a bot or Russian when they don’t like what you have to say. And CNN will flat out block comments.

Brent Robinson you don’t care about people dying to fucking moron so just stop it. If you did you’d be petitioning for more gun control or less wars or action on climate change. But you aren’t doing that are you? No. What you care about is stopping brownish colored people from entering the country because you’re a xenophobic asshole.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down.

Carol Chisumvii per the Politico poll, 44% support the wall. Per the Reuters poll, 41% support the wall. Per the Hill poll, 34% support the wall.  Now, I hate polls. They often have flawed methodology and can be misleading. That being said, they are probably a more reliable source than your ass, which is where you pulled that "74%" number from...  To be fair if you meant to comment that 74% of "Republican voters" or 74% of "Trump voters" support the wall - I believe you, and if you edit your comment to include that qualifier, I will delete this criticism.

Micheal Marceaux that's why I used the qualifier "most".

Edward Dennis Toppe Israel is incredibly smaller than the United States not to mention that wall and Israel is really apples to oranges.  The people coming to America are seeking a better life and running away from violence low wages and poverty. There is no way in the world that there is not a better option.,We all want security but the wall isn't going to fix anything. This isn't the Ming Dynasty. We don't have hordes of Mongols pillaging our towns. It didn't work then or now.
LITERALLY NOBODY is talking about open borders, you fucking moron.,No other country has open borders why should we
It not trump that wants the wall its america.... The government can stay shut down.... federal employees knew this could happen when they signed the employment papers....

Your delusional you lie about the numbers and fabricate falseness If you must have it so damn bad..pay for it out of your pocket not mine!!!

Natalie Harris Gilbert build the wall! Protect America! MAGA!,Yes we do !
Curtis Rice would not make it back in the country then.....,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
LOLOLOLOL I just won $100.00 because you mentioned Obama.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak dems could care less about American's. Walkaway,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Todd Cuson on!y because dems were in bed with hussein o and clinton. Get the popcorn, it's coming for the corrupt hussein o administration,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Gary Kane why don't you remove the commies from your state and leave with them. Build OUR wall. Trump 2020,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Rod Novoa I guess you voted for deblasio. 6 more years little snowflake, Trump is the greatest president America has ever had.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Jamie Stowell Short my girl!!,Build the wall!! I support you President Trump!
Dave Callender Well it was built. If your line of thought is this then what is the solution to protect the worm crawling into USA. USA is full of insects now. The China wall protected to some degree of crawling of enemies anyway. I was in London in the 60 s. When I visited UK in 2002, I see there was no road rules. It is like honkers flying. Every week there is a protest march. Why cannot humans live like humans. The cleanliness and the integrity of the British man is gone. Please give your solution and do not argue. Should be positive comments.,Yes must be a border wall. There is a reason for China building the great wall of China. How about the wall in Germany after the second WW. There must be a wall on the Mexican border to protect worms crawling into USA. Mexicans have there own standard of living and behaviour.

Peace be upon the Commander of the Believers Ali bin Abi Talib (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
All you liberals need to shut up.  Build the wall and throw the liberals over it.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Ammar Alhoushi شو بدك فيو هيدا فشاء حكي,😂 أنا بس عم استفسر الجماعة لمين تابعين
Maureen Gallagher Kawa - you’d have to ask my CPA.,I want the border secure.  I live in Texas and I can’t tell you several times  I hired someone with a Social Security number that turned  out to be fake when I filed it with Social Security. I never knowingly hired anyone who was illegal. That means that I paid someone $20 an hour for 40 hours a week and they did not pay any income taxes because they lied.   If you’re an illegal alien you cannot pay income tax because you do not have a Social Security number. Think about that Americans.
Sara Margaret no I spelled it right, I'm sorry you never learned to read.,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you sound like a stupid dumb record playing over and over....
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you sound like a stupid dumb record playing over and over....,TRUMP : "I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great great wall on our southern border and I'LL HAVE MEXICO PAY FOR IT"
Police in Aurora, Illinois, have released the names of the five Henry Pratt Co. employees who were killed in Friday's shooting: • Clayton Parks of Elgin, Illinois. He was a human resources manager. • Trevor Wehner of DeKalb, Illinois. He was a human resources intern and a student at Northern Illinois University  • Russell Beyer of Yorkville, Illinois. He was a mold operator. • Vicente Juarez of Oswego, Illinois. He was a stock room attendant and fork lift operator. • Josh Pinkard of Oswego, Illinois. He was a plant manager.  Related Article: These are the victims of the mass shooting in Aurora, Illinois The gunman, Gary Martin, 45, shot several of the men at a meeting during which he was being fired, Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said Saturday. At least one of the slain men was found on another level in the building, she said. Martin was not supposed to own a gun because of a 1995 aggravated assault conviction in Mississippi, she said. But he obtained one in Illinois in 2014. In January of that year, he applied for a firearms owner identification card, she said. In March 2014, he applied to buy a gun from a dealer in Aurora. After a waiting period and passing a background check that did not involve fingerprinting, he bought the gun, she said. Later that month, he applied for a concealed carry permit, and a fingerprint check led authorities to discover the Mississippi conviction, Ziman said. The permit was rejected, and Illinois State Police sent him a letter demanding he voluntarily surrender the weapon, but he did not, the chief said. Investigators are trying to determine why he didn't surrender the weapon and whether law enforcement followed up with him to confiscate the gun. "He was not supposed to be in possession of a firearm," Ziman said.,A man just slaughtered 5 innocent people in Illinois. He was angry American male... AGAIN
Kathy Finley Hayden yep so how does  a wall help us??,A man just slaughtered 5 innocent people in Illinois. He was angry American male... AGAIN

200 a day? I call BS on that. The numbers of illegals crossing are way down from a decade ago according to the immigration and security services. This is BS,Rod Novoa your a CNN washed ANTI AMERICAN fool that trolls all darkness!

Barbara Hansen it will save billions of dollars.. article from may of 2016: “Criminal aliens — non-citizens who commit crimes — are a growing threat to public safety and national security, as well as a drain on our scarce criminal justice resources. In 1980, our federal and state prisons housed fewer than 9,000 criminal aliens. Today, about 55,000 criminal aliens account for more than one-fourth of prisoners in Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities, and there are about 297,000 criminal aliens incarcerated in state and local prisons. That number represents about 16.4 percent of the state and local prison population compared to the 12.9 percent of the total population comprised of foreign-born residents.,John Baron the pay is indirect- and he has kept more campaign promises than any other politician in my lifetime
Carolie Warden which he is a pro at,You promised Mexico would pay for it...lie #1 And it won't work!!!

Alix Kruz Turns out you are full of crap. Prove it!,Turns out that there was rigging going on in the 2016 election, and Trump was steering it too!  #CrookedTrump
Suiter Kaye That’s on Flint, Michigan. That falls under state government. What is your corrupt Democrat run state government doing with your money instead of fixing your drinking water problems? That doesn’t have anything to do with the rest of us. I wouldn’t bring that up if I were you. It doesn’t prove your point.,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that’s where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don’t see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That’s unacceptable.  Anyway, I’m done discussing it.  If 🇷🇺 doesn’t interfere,  😉 I’m sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
Ferris---BS! The House passed the bill but there are not 60 republican's in the senate to pass it. Schumer with many democrat's "voted" for wall funding last yr but they didn't want to give up "chain migration" or "the lottery system", so the bill failed. The democrat's want 1 immigrant to also get 25 of his relative's to get in at the same time & that's OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!!,Patrick Buster totally! I disagree on politics with some of my best friends... even my husband sometimes. 😂😂
Barbara Combs--The democrat's want democrat illegal votes & Trump gone. PERIOD!,The Democrats want to see America destroyed to get back at the President.  Can’t the democrat & liberals see this?
Martin Sr.-- Sure, there is a high structure up by the ports of entry but there is only falling down 5 foot wire fencing across miles after that. And miles of NO fences, where evil people can sneak in. I've watched the documentation's of it. You need to get more informed about this subject.,Karen Harvey  ok Republican
Zavala---BS! The democrat's walked away & wouldn't talk about it. Pelosi even insulted our Sec. of Homeland Security & told her, she didn't believe the facts she put out. Trump stayed at the WH during Christmas & New Year, to work on this but Pelosi went to Hawaii to vacation. The House passed the bill in Dec & now Schumer & the dem's own the shutdown!,Karen Harvey you forgot the part where the president said he owned it!  In fact he said he was Proud to own it!
Huber---You are just incapable or don't want to understand the savings from Trump's new trade deals with Mexico, where we were losing billions every year. He never said Mexico would be sending a check!! The savings from those trade deals will be paying off the wall many times over in the years to come. It's that simple!,So we will save $12B in trade from Mexico in just this year? I don't think so.
Chenier--This is just one case out of thousands every year. The liberal democrat media refuses to report on them, because it doesn't help their agenda for open border's. The point is, that these illegal's weren't suppose to be here & each case would have been one "less case" of a family losing a loved one to murder, or a killing by a drunk driving illegal.,Sad to see this man has lost his lovely daughter. However, this is still not a national emergency.
Jerry Robinson ---Communist published Time? Man, have you been indoctrinated, sad one.,Lannette Syck Yeah, don't believe facts dug up by thousands of journalists! Trump gullibles must only believe him, the great white nationalist liar -- a politician who have a general believability index of one notch above used-car salesmen. See no truth. Hear no truth. Speak no truth. Good luck!
Robinson---You have a terrible comprehension problem, with no common sense to boot. Your post is BS!,Lannette Syck Yeah, don't believe facts dug up by thousands of journalists! Trump gullibles must only believe him, the great white nationalist liar -- a politician who have a general believability index of one notch above used-car salesmen. See no truth. Hear no truth. Speak no truth. Good luck!
Butkowsky--BS!  He wasn't suppose to be here & her daughter would still be alive, along with hundreds every year from D-Driving & deliberate murder's by illegal's, if Obama's "Catch & Release Act" was ended & the border was secured by the barrier, technology & more agents.,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Decker---That's total BS!,From your statement it would seem that you are not one of the intelligent ones, right?
Matthew Kentner --APRIL??? Try polling them tomorrow.,Patton---Yeah and that electrical grid can be tampered with by terrorist's sneaking in through unsecured border miles!!! Use your brain!
Lamphier--What is it that you want them to get??,And the victims of Orlando, Las Vegas, & Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, what do they get? Oh yes, thoughts and prayers aka absolutely nothing.
Kris Knight----They're not funny in the least!,You could ask for 5 billion for cancer research Mr. President and they would appose it.    🖕 them puppets. Build the wall off the 800 thousand checks your not mailing out. Keep it shut down!!
Wagner---Because guess what?....The democrat's have to vote on that too!,Why not just make it a condition of providing Mexico the $5.8 Billion in foreign aid that they use it to build the wall?
Morris---A Mexican name? It's our wall. It should say "Welcome To America" Please come in legally.,If you give the wall a name so that it won’t be the Trump wall the Democrats will bend they don’t want a monument named after you give it a Mexican name who cares just don’t call it the Trump wall
Kentner---BS!,Tim Gilbert spoken like the the sheepeople you must be. Way to sit up and pay attention like a good little boy. You would do well being a citizen of North Korea. I’m not screaming...just making fun of the folks like yourself that lack the ability to think critically or at all.... in many cases. It’s ok your parents didn’t teach you to think. Shouldn’t you be consuming blindly or shopping at Walmart? At least you can hunt.
Rodriguez---Thank you & God Bless you & your wife.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Hammer---Yeah, finally giving them some truth!!!!,Sean Patrick McCarthy
Harrah---BS! The House passed it big time. It was the Senate that didn't because of the stupid 60 vote rule!,I did not say that.  The repubs had the chance.  Now are balking.  trump is a fool and traitor.
Patton---Yeah and that electrical grid can be tampered with by terrorist's sneaking in through unsecured border miles!!! Use your brain!,illegal crossing is down to lowest levels in years
He tweeted last month the "border is secure"   why did he send the military home? Why has used only 6% of what the Congress gave him last year?  You know he can't just put up a wall on private land right? It will take decades in court...You know all this right?  trump supporter logic= No Logic,John Baron the pay is indirect- and he has kept more campaign promises than any other politician in my lifetime
Dan, It's B.O.R.D.E.R   Trump ball licker Crack me up.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
I say wait for the checks to come in from Mexico.🤔,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.

So our nation should be like a prison?,Matthew Cloward ya I guess prison wall are just for looks  … ya right
And ironically, it was only a promise because his campaign staff considered him too scatterbrained to remember his immigration talking points, so they gave him a one syllable word he could use.  It was only when the crowd cheered that he decided to make it a campaign feature and a promise.,You noticed
ROFL.  The ACA was a compromise, and included 140+ GOP amendments and changes.,No more DACA, Build the damn wall! No more Amnesty! Build the Wall!
That ship has already sailed for Donnie.,Jocke Stangebye  I never pictured Stanley as a wanker...but now that you mention it...
Karen Harvey Ah, so sad about the 60 needed votes. Where are Trump's much vaunted negotiating and deal making skills? Didn't he campaign on being the best deal maker in the history the world?  And speaking of obstructionist: The Senate passed the VERY SAME BILL the Democrats just passed in the House to reopen the government -- passed it by 90 to 10, a bipartisan vote. But oh, that was before the new House came in. Now Mitch McConnell won't even put THAT SAME BILL to a Senate vote.,Patton---Yeah and that electrical grid can be tampered with by terrorist's sneaking in through unsecured border miles!!! Use your brain!
Karen Harvey Trump said he would never sign it. This was after claiming he would sign any bipartisan legislation that came across his desk.,Patton---Yeah and that electrical grid can be tampered with by terrorist's sneaking in through unsecured border miles!!! Use your brain!
Tess Calomino There were actually more votes for Democratic Senator candidates than for GOP.  Go ahead and check; it's public record.  GOP gained seats due to gerrymandering.,Tim Gilbert . No crying here. Im satisfied with the results.
Howard Bushart that's funny s*** right there do you have any family I have to stand there to protect that wall and you know what's really going on at that wall since you live down there or do you believe what you see on CNN,No wall for you.  But be of good cheer, no one with half a mind expected you to keep your word or tell the truth.
Cheryl Bowler Schrager  Stupid,WALLS DO NOT WORK.  Stop using victims as props!
Charlie Daboub you do realize it took 10 Democrats from the Senate to pass any Bill that included money for the Wall. The Democrats refused to work with the Republican Senators, not counting the several RINOS in the Republican Party who also refused to vote for the Wall. I have never understood why the RINOS are even in the Republican Party other than to help the Democrats block real Conservative Bills. These are some of the reasons why the Wall was not built in the last two years.,President Trump please keep standing strong against these anti-American, Globalists, Open Borders people! "We The People" want you to build the Wall for our protection! Thank you and God bless you, Sir!💖
States will never be unified when we are talking about two different parties, but what we are talking about is common sense, the barrier needs built and laws changed. Not because they don't like this president.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
They don't care about our security, all they care about is obstruction...and that obstruction isn't just against Trump...it's against ALL OF US who voted for him!  They are NOT representing the people!  They are doing their OWN WILL, against the American people, who put Trump in office by an overwhelming majority!  The ILLEGITIMATE HOUSE we have now, by voter corruption and FRAUD will feel our wrath in 2020.,The Democrats are opposing the President ONLY BECAUSE they are just about obstruction!!!  THEY KNOW the Border needs a wall and security...see below:  https://www.facebook.com/redpillusa/videos/223178005279698/The Caucasian ManDemocrats: “Shiiiiiiiiieeeet”Play Video
Grateful that our president is protecting us.  God Bless you in your upward battle.,Grateful that our president is protecting us.  God Bless you in your upward battle.
Amy Perry Jenson yes, exactly what Obama did to get his way. Great teaching by example.,What’s more important a Wall or People being able to provide for their families!! Time for Congress to change the laws on Shutting down the Government!! The Government should never ever be able to shut down without the votes coming from the house and the senate approval!! This needs to soon be enforced because every-time U cannot have your way this is exactly what U will do!! RESIGN
Bobby Wilson they will get back pay. Meanwhile I would like to get my community back, so I want border security.,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Charissa Rausch I wish you could experience what we deal with in border states and perhaps understand. Additional fencing along with increased personnel and technology is needed to slow the tide. Three of my family members have personally suffered from the doings of illegals committing criminal acts. Our school is bilingual and challenged by the transient attendance. Our neighborhoods have transmitted to third world country appearance and operation. Without a slowdown, there is no way for absorption and assimilation to work. You may not feel it yet in Idaho, but it won't take long at this pace.,I am not in favor of constructing a border wall, but you aren't interested in my opinion or representing me as an American. You only seem interested in representing your "base." Weren't you elected to represent ALL the people?
Donna Snyder please contact your area uso and American legions,Stand firm sir. I do wish something could be done for the coast guard service personnel! They have no union benefits
Leif Menzie lucky to live in America where there is help. Time to make sure we can keep it that way!,Yeah I think the people going to food banks right now for food would disagree with you.
Sarah Knutson. Your world,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Susan Dowd that is how they did it for 35 years and nothing got done after the fact. Not this time.,Terry Clark what's Hillary got to do with anything. That shipped sailed long ago. You guys need a new tune....lol
Diane Ruckdeschel the Democrats could fix it all and "save the daca kids" in ONE VOTE....let's wait and see what they do...they don't care about the daca kids or the federal employees...they only care about votes....they voted for the wall in 2006 (Obama, shumer and Hillary Clinton, they only are opposing now because they hate Trump. They change their policies as often as they change their underwear.wake up people...they don't care about you....if they did they would make policies that didn't keep people stuck on food stamps and welfare. They WANT YOU DEPENDAND ON ON THEM!,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
The law today is still the law TODAY.  I don't care - they are not criminals, terrorists and can SUPPORT THEMSELVES. We need to look at the other side of the coin and realize what is actually coming into this country.  I say NO MORE REFUGEES as well.  Criminalize stepping across this our border if not at a port of entry, and start keeping statistics of those in our prisons that are illegals as well.  Keeping data on just how much these freeloaders are costing us in 'BORROWED' tax funds is essential.  It's our money - we need to see where it goes.,We MUST get to the root cause - our STUPID asylum laws!  You nailed it with that, the Visa Lottery and chain migration  STOP THE MADNESS!  Get to the ROOT CAUSE or we will continue to spin on this hamster wheel!
Build the wall!!!!! Do you really want all your taxes to pay for caring for the illegals instead of American's?,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don’t support it. Don’t say we.
Ralph Harris uh no!!!  I just know lies when I hear them! Good...how much of a check are you willing to write out toward the wall? I bet not much! Lol,Ralph Harris uh no!!!  I just know lies when I hear them! Good...how much of a check are you willing to write out toward the wall? I bet not much! Lol
🐑,38 er cent approval rating.
🐑,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
🐑,Trump is a lying scammer. Can't trust him with anything.
😂😂😂😂 sorry not visa for you,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Albert Kojo Kyekye lmfaoo,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Lyle Geyer What is ‘safty’?,America is truly a fucked up place. Thousands of Americans are shot by other Americans. You do nothing about gun control but are happy to spend millions to keep a handful of criminals out rather than deal with the ones you’ve already got.
Ron Liptack enjoy the next SIX years Ronnie. TRUMP2020!   KAG!,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
Troy Ganci likewise,Chris Jordan G Obama destroyed 50 % of it all ready . Trumps rebuilding.. 2020
Wow!,Bonnie S. Pickett Because there are fanatics like the trump supporters who have come felt free to express their hatred due to trump's encouragement with his hateful tweets. :)
Spoken like a true Liberal.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Reda Haas, I think that you are confused. Obama's no longer our president.,Then u shold start telling the truth. Almost half this nation believe your lies and turning on the half of the nation. Was that your objective, to divide a nation? U certainly have done that!!!!!!!!!
Barbara Warrell Jones YA THINK!!! Then why hasn’t it been done!!!🤮🤮🤮,Steven Anargyros "we?"....um NO. YOU are with him and yelling about it
James Novotny  That is just. A ignorant statement with ABSOUTLY no truth behind it at all. But then again you dems care nothing of the truth,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Roy Talley  Lol right!,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Brent Robinson, you've just described the GOP. Lol! Except...where in hell did you find a poll that suggests The Moron has a high approval rating? More than 50% disapprove at this point. He's losing his baseless base bigly.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Also, if you literally  can't afford the fine, or the premiums you file this form with your taxes...and you're exempt.....the fine is much less costly than the premiums for the cheapest insurance you  can buy....but...here is the link: .https://marketplace.cms.gov/applications-and-forms/hardship-exemption.pdf,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Jessica Cecilia Motley, The aca helps more people afford medical care... period... protecting you and myself from preexisting conditions and a host of other things...the fact is, the individual state governments decide whether or not they participate fully....i.e, Alabama doesn't expand Medicaid, therefore making the pool of insured people much smaller...less people in the pool means less distribution of costs which causes prices to go up . insurance companies pull up roots and leave the market place and go to stated where there's some competition....blue Cross is the only available insurance company in our market place for people under 65.   ...so they ( blue Cross blue shield) have Monopoly over the insurance market....  They don't have any reason to be competitive with pricing ........the governments don't mind because we are paying 20 times for their gold insurance than the cost of  Medicaid expansion..they'd receive grant funding for expanding Medicaid...but since they choose to not participate, the cost comes back to us...sir, ma'am taxpayer. Now...what makes more sense? Get grant funding to pay for Medicaid for the folks who need it ..or just not doing it at all and paying extra for healthcare premiums???,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Roy Meston other Presidents have had govt shutdowns. Do your history.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Trump is making America a third world country. He is dividing and mail g America hate everyone,is going a good job of making us a nation
Dave Callender well if we can cancel out the law of people coming in legally these we can get rid of every law and be a lawless country ! Fine by me but will you be ok with it Santa Claus when a criminal is at your door ? I’m guessing no you smart ass,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Michael Trader - that’s not true.,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
Payo Trevino are you really from america??you sound like an Arab,come on Democrat impeach that son-of-a-b****
Brent Robinson biggest tax scam for corporations and the wealthy... proven fact...,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Stan Piznarski copy and paste much bud... no original though needed...,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Do you have the proof to back your statement, actual proof not media proof.,It would be awesome if you hadn’t colluded with Russia to win the election, and compromise the United States in the process.
David Huthmaker Banks have offered ‘ no interest’ loans until they do. When they get the Retro pay , they will pay back the loans.,the coast guard helps defend our borders, yet here they are not getting paid

Don't you just love the "get the hell out of my country"?    It's not YOUR country, it's everyone's. Why don't YOU get the hell out?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
,Shut the government down for as long as you have to, as well as stop giving billions of dollars in aid to these corrupt countries.  Nancy and Chuck are evil.   Thank you President Trump for protecting us and our future.
James Kenney please know facts before posting. Trump's father gave him $1 million which he turned into $4 billion.  No flunky.   He is one of the most elite entrepreneurs in US history and an amazing negotiator.  Art of the deal -playing out for us since he stepped into the WH,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Lonny Watters been there. Our country is so far gone it may never be right again,Willard Swanke i want a wall built deep and tall.
TRUE,Willard Swanke i want a wall built deep and tall.
Beverly Hurst Smith thank you President Trump for all you've done & still doing for our country!!!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Duval Sotelo hate to break it to you, but the House was mostly Republicans until a few days ago!  The shutdown started in Dec 2018! The Democrats were sworn in to office January 2019! trump said he would take full credit for the shutdown, REMEMBER!  There is NO emergency!  Just trump responding to the conservatives talking heads and FOX Entertainment news! Why didn't he use his "fantastic negotiating skills" (at least that's what he calls them) to talk the few Democrats he needed into voting yes? Because the Republicans didn't want a wall and didn't negotiate in support of it!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Steve Imbresci what happen to "the best negotiator" "no one better"?,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Kathryn Walker Emanuel you mean dividing the country and showing how little negotiating skills he really has. He couldn't even get his own party to agree to pay for his stupid useless wall!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Derek Crow-Brown WHY didn't trump ask for 5.1 Billion in his budget?  You know the one that he presented, asking for 1.5 billion,  that was passed and ready for him to sign?  So why did it becone an EMERGENCY after FOX and conservative Talking Heads said to NOT negotiate?  WHY  didn't trump pass the funding when he had both Houses and just needed a couple of votes?  WHY didn't the Republicans negotiate for trump with the few Democrats?  WHY after 2 years has he decided to ransom the American people for a Wall that is obsolete?,Nancy Pelosi wants to thank you for voting democrat in the last election. She and 30 of her democrat coworkers along with 100+ lobbyists were having a lovely time in Puerto Rican enjoying that balmy weather, attending the play Hamilton and partying with the cast in the evening, while regular Americans are struggling to make ends meet since giving 0.005% of the $3.8 trillion annual budget for the wall is just to expensive!
Mark Hack did he bring HIS and his families businesses to the USA?  NO, they are still in China and other Asian countries!  But don't worry NONE of them are on the Tariffs list! Did Mexico agree to pay for the Wall?  Did Hillary go to jail? Did he sue those women who said he sexually assaulted them?  But trump followers don't care! They think they're making more money  , and money is all they care about!,thanks for saving the country
Mark Hack you're correct, FOX ENTERTAINMENT news has never retracted the "Pizzagate" story or "that Obama wasn't born in the USA" or "that Obama was coming for your guns" or "FEMA camps"! FOX is NOT a NEWS program the CEO of FOX said "they are an ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAM!",thanks for saving the country
Mark Hack  https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/tv/fox/ Here you go. And a bunch of other half truths and lies!,thanks for saving the country
Mark Hack anything not spoken by trump or conservative Talking Heads is a lie according to trump brainwashed cult followers!,thanks for saving the country
Mark Hack so you STILL believe the pathological liar in the WH??,thanks for saving the country
You know why the Russians helped get their operative elected President?  So they could destroy the U.S from the inside!  Because of trump's tariffs the Russians are prospering!  They are now supplying China  instead of us and our farmers are on Government welfare!   Did trump and family ever bring THEIR businesses to the USA?  NO, THEY ARE ALL STILL IN CHINA and other Asian countries!  But it's OK NONE of them are included in the tariffs!,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all

A home grown killer...,A man just slaughtered 5 innocent people in Illinois. He was angry American male... AGAIN
Bull O'Neill  and then why is Trump ignoring these problems?  At the Rose Garden speech..why didn't he have Parkland families there?  Explain that,How about all the children killed on schools?  It is always horrible when a child is killed...but we also have home grown terrorists.
Bob Segal  35% is NOT polling number.  It is the percentage of his faithful base.  Try reading the entire post.  And I could care less what his approval rating is...he is worthless,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Keith Webber Jr.  You are wrong ..you must be in Trump's 35% base,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Keith Webber Jr. Many National Emergencies were called prior to President Obama (why you all bring up Obama and Clinton all the time...get over them...focus on now)...but did Obama want to take money from the military or drug intervention programs? Trump himself ...in the Rose Garden... said..after he declared a National Emergency....he didn't need to do this now.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Tommy Carpenter How was he voted in illegally?  He won the Popular vote and Electoral College vote each time ...Trump lost the Popular vote...even with Putin's help,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Keith Webber Jr. Trump used them as a prop.  Where were Parkland parents?,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....

Ronald Penn what did they lie about?,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Gary Kane CHAOS? It seems that our country is in chaos when people think GOD isn't real, killing babies is acceptable and the word respect, no longer means anything. Evil is trying to take over and people don't open their eyes to see.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Lisa Mann Mr. Trump will not be President forever but the wall will.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Richard Rogers you are an idiot,Kathy Turner Charles These are what we like to call FACTS.

Jeramy Felton Hargis He is the one working while the Democrats vacation.  Love you President Trump,He just wants to government shutdown so he can golf more
Gree Gree Yes. If murders got what they deserved maybe they'd be less of them.,Prayers for everyone who have lost loved ones because of illegal aliens. This is absolutely insane. Thankfully, I don't know anyone who has been harmed by an illegal but I am still for the wall. Walls are good. Walls help with many things. The people against to wall are - well, I won't put it in print - but one day it's going to affect them and we'll see how their opinion is then. So many people hate this president more than they love their country. God bless the friends and family affected and God bless our president and those trying to help.
Tim Baldwin I'm sure the whole world has awaited your pronouncement. Mr. Nobody.,Democrats are anarchists, and anyone who believes and follows them are also anarchists, whether they want to be or not.
Bull O'Neill You obviously are repeating crap that you have heard and I gather do not spend much time reading and learning about the rescession…..Maybe this will help you a bit ….you will be hoping for another President like Obama by the time Trump is out of office because his spending is on steroids.....I am sure you won't believe me  but easily researched.....but you won't like the facts you will find out. He has never been fiscally good with his own companies that is why he has filed bankruptcy so often.     https://www.therichest.com/rich-list/the-biggest/the-top-10-biggest-spending-presidents/      https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/trump-budget-deficits-growing-big-spending-fiscal-irresponsibility/           and he isn't doing well in the way of trade deficits either despite his bragging...…     https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/08/03/trump-hates-trade-deficit-its-track-be-biggest-decade/?utm_term=.7f7f6ef1fee9\,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Mike Stoumbaugh you must not understand how paying works. Our tax money is going to build the wall. If there is more American business we should use that money to lower my taxes.,YOU AREN'T FULFILLING YOUR PROMISE!! YOU SAID MEXICO WOULD PAY. NOW YOU WANT AMERICAN MONEY TO PAY.  YOU ARE A LIAR!!
You missed the entire point of my post, Janie. Congratulations.   By your logic, everyone who dies by firearm wouldn't be dead if those were banned. Does that mean that we should ban firearms? No, it does not. Does that mean we should politicize gun deaths for the sake of taking gun rights away? No.   Please understand the complete hypocrisy before commenting again.,Conservatives- DoNt PoLiTiCizE gUn DeAtHs, sTuPiD DeMs  Also Conservatives- Politicize deaths at the hands of illegal immigrants.   UPDATE- You are just as dead if you're killed by an illegal immigrant as you are by a legal citizen. Only difference is, more people are killed by legal citizens every year than illegals lol. BaN uS cItIzEns!!
Dorrie Reed Peaco if he cared that much about money he would be taking his pay as president, but yet he isnt doing that 🤔,This old fool doesn't care anything about America, he only cares about himself and money.
Alberto Weisz hell no because then all the white crackheads will take my stuff!!,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.

I'm sorry for your loss. But then, how about white males shooting up schools and theaters? This is utter hypocrisy!,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!

Military still getting paid,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that’s where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don’t see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That’s unacceptable.  Anyway, I’m done discussing it.  If 🇷🇺 doesn’t interfere,  😉 I’m sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
Morons. Smmfh,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
"Dave Callender, we've got you covered because Ann had Allstate",10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed.

Bonnie Lee Now we know why Obama was referered to as The Commander in Chief it always puzzled me, was he leading a Foreign Army  into the USA ?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Rod Novoa really so if the Russians influenced the elections then how on Earth did Hillary win the Popular Vote.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Buck Strunk where is Canadas wall,No other country has open borders why should we
Mike Mandel well guess what. That is exactly what is proposed.,I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.
El Chapo's money should be used to pay for the wall!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Trump 2020 Keep America Great!!!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

Democrats like it when illegals kill Police officers and innocent civilians, Demtards have blood on their hands...,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Build that wall Mr President we support you,Nothing but a piece of propaganda
Lil Anne Garcia Go Crawl Back Under Your Rock,Eric Wroblewski thank you

Did my awful truth make you angry... 😭😭😭😭😭😳😱,Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. Now, Mexico said fck no, and the people don't care...   Hmmm, what other lies has he told...
In my personal experience I have been assaulted by good old fashioned God-fearing Southern boys 3 times.  Your opinion does not invalidate my personal experience. Please tell me about your experiences as a lesbian.,As a gay woman I worry more about white men than brown men
Only thing in the morning the news is the corrupt justice department, and the Clinton's paying for a phony dossier that was used to spy on Americans,Turns out that there was rigging going on in the 2016 election, and Trump was steering it too!  #CrookedTrump
Kathy A Norton Really???  It takes two parties to talk and actually make a deal to solve a problem.  I don't see the Dems doing much talking.  They were just partying it up in Puerto Rico, on a get away paid for by political lobbyist.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Chris Jackson Trump 2020, and I hope you snowflakes melt.,So since you want to defend the borders, you’ll drop the plan for a wall that will literally never perform as promised.   We need freedom more than anything else, and you are even more anti-freedom than the last 5 dingbats in chief
Chris Jackson Wait to see what freedoms you have after these idiotic new Democrats tweak things.,So since you want to defend the borders, you’ll drop the plan for a wall that will literally never perform as promised.   We need freedom more than anything else, and you are even more anti-freedom than the last 5 dingbats in chief

Leslie Reyes I think they used too long of a needle when they injected her Botox... accidentally injected her brain.,All americans. Thank you Sheldon. Trump is the President America needs to keep America safe and great!
Randy Cameron The Democrats are already here.,Hey Mr President you’re a Ass Hole 🕳. And the biggest Lier in America History you’re working for President Putin you’re Giving the USA 🇺🇸 Too President Putin. Hey Mr President Donald Duck 🦆 Trump When is Russia 🇷🇺 Move in our Talking Over The Great America 👈
Idiot.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Both sides are afraid he will fix things?? That makes zero sense. What's it like to live in your brain I wonder.,Both sides are afraid you'll fix things, it gives them less to fight about and less to feel 'needed'. Keep it up!
Joseph R Phipps CNN is ok but no its not my main source of news. I have about 20 different sources. What do you have? Fox "for entertainment only" News and the washington examiner? 😂😂😂,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps a reset button is better than being Putin's puppet! Don't you think? Putin is enjoying every minute with Trump as president.  He's drinking vodka with his buddies like "I so own this guy!!",The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps first off he's not "my boy." I don't blindly support politicians like you Trumpers do. I criticized Obama plenty.  Russia is interfering in our elections as we speak. They have even hacked into our electrical grids ECT. So I don't know if Putin has a tape of Trump peeing on underage hookers or what. Russia is not our ally.  Sorry but Mueller is VERY busy with Trumps crimes. Is it even possible for you to debate without bringing up past presidents? Who by the way aren't under investigation.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Marcia Losee well you know he hires "the best people" right???,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Educate yourself. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/09/27/donald-trump-barack-obama-economy-column/1413881002/,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
He did all he could to roll back regulations that protect companies from polluting and screwing up the environment. I guess that's how he is creating jobs.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps I never said it wasn't.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps Mueller's report might not be a big deal. We don't know. But he has sure done a great job of catching witches!! 😂😂,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps but Obama had 8 years and he is friends with the Bushes now. You think any ex president would ever be friends with traitor Trump? I think that's a hard no. Thank god there's no chance in hell we will have 8 years with this chump. We might not even have 4 years with the way he's going!,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps do you happen to know where I can donate to the Trump foundation?  Also Im thinking of going to Trump University. Do you know if it's a good school? 😂😂😂😂😂,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps he did bring him up at the very beginning. And he had every right to as Bush left us in one of our worst recessions in history. 2 years in and Trump continues to talk about Obama and even Hillary who lost the election. He's a whiny little bitch.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps no Manafort did things on the campaign as well. Probably at the direction of Trump. He's a very crooked man. You think he was clean and good while runing another criminals campaign. Have you seen his court documents. Hundreds of redactions. Hmmmm....probably nothing to do with your god Trump.  You claim all these things but don't back them up with any sources which leads me to believe you get these tidbits from some crazy conspiracy news. You might want to see a psychatrist for your obsession with Obama. Your constant deflections are getting old.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps oh god don't even start. Obama is gone now. And all you people do is deflect to him and Hillary. Its getting old and sad.  Do you even have a clue what Trump is doing to the environment. Maybe ask a family that lives near a structure that is back polluting again because of him.  Obama did not have the longest job loss streak ever. You sound like Trump just spouting nonsense. Its pathetic.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps people don't claim that. He did inherit a good economy but look what he's doing to it. Mr. Man of the People giving bigly tax breaks to the ultra wealthy. Now he's costing us billions with his stupid distraction shut down. He's adding astronomical debt. Didn't he promise to eliminate the debt? Oh right...he's a liar. Trump will most likely leave us in a recession. Too bad we won't have Obama to get us out of it.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps what happened to the Republicans being the party of law and order?? The party of values??,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps yes Putin is getting everything he wants from Trump isn't he??,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Joseph R Phipps yes he loves to put his name all over everything doesn't he?? 😂😂😂 Marks his territory like a dog. Doesn't change the fact that he scams people left and right does it?,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.

Erika Rhone its astounding what they believe. How does a halfway smart person listen to Trump lie and change his story constantly and go, " Gee what a great leader!"  I guess when he told them not to believe what they read or hear...they listened.  Kellyanne said there were alternative facts- so they just go with those!! Lol,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
Defintely will go down in history as a corrupt traitor. A fluke!! His supporters will be remembered as a cult.,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
Elaine Campbell good luck with that 2020 thing. If he even makes it to that election.,It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
Bill Harris I'm pretty sure both parties have been screwed up in many different ways over time. The Republicans are the mess right now. The Trumpers/Tea party have driven away Republicans in droves. So much that people I never thought would vote democrat are switching parties. Trump is the biggest mistake they ever made.,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Pelosi is doing great!! Exactly what she was elected to do.,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Anne Crossway I truly think he is enjoying this. He loves drama. That's what you get when you elect a reality show guy for president. Country's biggest mistake ever.,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Chase Blood Congress IS doing its job. We elected them for this!!! Its why we won the house. To put some checks on this psychopath running the country.,Just do an executive order and be done with it
It doesn't work like that. If it did wouldn't he have done that 2 years ago. Why hold the country hostage now out of the blue? My guess is he is mad the Dems took the house and scared to death of what Mueller has on him as he watches all of his associates go to prison. This is his big distraction and its failing BIGLY.,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Julie Williams what do you mean?,Nancy and her ilk need to swing by the neck.
Randall Hayes I want to answer you but its hard to understand your grammar.,Terry Hogan , you know what it is like to loose a child and I would never wish that on no one , tell me what would you tell the Angel Parents about you view that you feel we do not needing a wall ?
Yanira Blanco what have any of the four people you mentioned done to deserve prison time? The last time I checked a bunch of Trumps people were going to prison including his personal lawyer, campaign manager and national security advisor. Trump is under 17 investigations. But yes, lets put the elderly billionaire George Soros in jail- who by the way is a super generous billionaire that actually gives his money to charity unlike Trump who ran a fraudulent foundation.  What is your obsession with Soros anyway? I think you might be watching too much right wing propaganda.,Keep up the good work. We are rooting for you. Build the wall.
Because it doesn't.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another

😂😂😂,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Wendi DelValle so sorry about your brother 😢,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
CM Garner  really cause trump was broke in the 2000’s and Putin bought condos off him for 12 times the worth and inbelzed money to Trump to the tune of 1/2 a billion dollars ~ he’s bailed him out not only once but twice ~ we have a Russian in the White House ~ even Nixon hated dictators and communist ~ Trumps a TrAitor ~ Putin’s puppet ~,Impeach this Russian owned traitor ~
Anthony Witcombe ok,Illegal immigrants have been killing people in Wales for hundreds of years.
Beverly Harris but they come in illegally. And bring in drugs and gangs,What about the people killed my homegrown terrorists in America. There's more murders committed by them
Dee Dee Kelly Colvin its sad that there are SO many illegals here,BUILD THE WALL AND MAKE THEM GO THROUGH THE LEGAL CHANNELS TO COME TO THE US.
Gato Gato dont forget drugs gangs cartel human trafficking. Not just killings,What about the Americans killing Americans? Never mention anything about that!! 🤔🤔🤔
There's a serious problem at our Southern borders.,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
Jose Nieto somebody needs to quit watching fake news. The Russia fake is already over he's been cleared. Lets see what other dity deed they try. Most of us normal Americans want security.,You joke. Exploiting the pain of this poor man to concoct an excuse for your idiotic wall. Your bigoted insecure supporters will cling to these rare examples and back you. The 70 percent of us who are rational and intelligent won’t. You are a malignant growth and will be excised. Russian puppet.

Joseph Roy Yes we should and we should do something about all the white guys with guns killing all of our women and children too dont you think? Yet we do NOTHING, heck the so called prez never has much to say about any of that does he, only focuses on mexicans day in and day out. So messed up!,I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
Same with all of us Americans who have lost family members to gun violence. Not one word ever said by Donny about that.,Kelly Preiss Wilhelm I never want to see anyone killed period. He does talk about it though.   “It’s criminals which will always have guns “. We could ban all guns in America.   The criminals would still have them.  Gun control only disarms the good ppl.  I’m so sorry you lost someone to this crime invested country.  And we all need to work together to push out the bad.  Not argue.  There’s a lot more good ppl than bad.  Ppl has to stand up to the thugs.  They’re out numbered by far.
Phoebe Cassandra Smith and even though I'm not a great Trump fan I think this politics as usual is a disgrace to this country. The Democrats can end the shutdown just as easily as the president can there's absolutely no doubt about that. and I'm not asking them to go against their own beliefs I'm just asking them to think about coming up with a compromise for something that they themselves have pushed over the past 10 years.,Wake up people. The wall between the left and the right in Washington DC is probably the most impermeable wall ever constructed it's not a physical wall but it's definitely an impermeable wall.
Marilyn didn't call anyone a name. Your case is pointless.,Why do the Trump cultists always call people names? Are they 5 years old?
Jackie McHugh Neither he nor his administration has submitted ANY form of legislation addressing the specifics for his vanity wall or a larger immigration reform plan.,Dan Rather: “Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security.  In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed.  That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent.  You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall.  You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work."

Maureen...are you saying we should put a wall around Chicago?,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(

Mellissa why do you pucker your mouth like that in all your photos? Just eat a lemon? From the info on your Facebook profile it appears you have a lot of personal house cleaning to do before you come on Facebook to solve America's border issues. Also, lose the arrogance. You have done nothing to earn it, "baby",Thank you MaryAnn for sharing your thoughts and encouraging others ❤❤❤❤Prayers for you and  for all the victims families ..agree so important to keep fighting .. Stay strong!
There have been no incidents of terrorists crossing the border, just being caught at the airport.  How are you so uninformed?,Except the wall won't work.

Anne Crossway agreed no only will it not work it will cause irreparable damage to the ecosystem, on top of blocking many people from vital water they need in an area with so little already,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
Next order of business, the constitution gives power to congress to make these decisions, if he just national emergency around this then who is to say any President after him wont do this and gain more and more power. Which is part if the issue now its become so normal for people to call the president the boss, but he is only the boss of one part of a three part government.,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
A national emergency needs to reviewed every year. It doesn't give you peoples land from imminent domain. Even if a border wall was approved you wouldn't see it.,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
Gary Kane you really are an ignorant ass,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Paige Elizabeth call about money.   How many other presidents do you know that is taking $0 to run this country.   Oh that's right no other president besides Trump has done that.  He has gotten paid $0. And has put up with a bunch of crap from liberals who are blinded and don't want to see the truth,You just call about money, why cant you just pay for the wall your damn self your a fucking millionaire
Carl Ostendarp better than New York where  you would killed them,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
You just saw the future,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels’ hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy’s and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
Well said, Michael.,An illegal immigrant killed one of my friends, I don’t blame them all for it. That’s stupid. The choice of an individual doesn’t reflect all of them

Bull O'Neill The Military Doesn’t Seem to Appreciate Trump’s Border Stunt                                                                       President Trump’s decision to deploy thousands of active-duty soldiers to the border with Mexico, ostensibly to defend against an “invasion” of asylum seekers from Central America, is such a transparent political stunt that even his fellow Republicans are dismayed — if only because they think it’s a less effective midterms strategy than focusing on the midterms. As it turns out, another group you might generally expect to support the president is also less than thrilled with his order: namely, the military itself.  Responding to criticism of the dubious deployment last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis demurred: “We don’t do stunts in this department.” The soldiers being sent to the border are there to provide support to the Department of Homeland Security, just as they often do after natural disasters, Mattis insisted. The secretary did not speak to the question of whether a dwindling caravan of around 3,000 Central American asylum seekers, currently 800 miles from the border and traveling on foot, really merited the same emergency response as a hurricane.  Since then, several reports have come out showing that Trump’s original vision for the deployment, tendentiously titled Operation Faithful Patriot, was larger in scope than what the Pentagon ultimately allowed, as some of what the president expected the soldiers to do was at best wasteful and at worst illegal. The administration’s first request, CNN reported on Friday, was for soldiers to provide “crowd and traffic control” and protect Customs and Border Protection personnel, which some Defense officials viewed as law enforcement activities the military is barred by law from performing. That request was rejected, as was a proposal that soldiers construct housing for detained migrants, according to Reuters.,The Wall is a figment and an fixation of Trump's sick twisted narcissistic mind!

Joan Clapp=TDS patient,Note your poll numbers are tanking and even suburban white men show an 18% drop in approval....You make all this love for you up so you feel OK about yourself....It isn’t working...
Joseph Hart first of all I  a disabled vet myself and have the utmost respect for any service member. Secondly, chill out buddy. You will get your pay. If you are in financial troubles after missing on paycheck then obviously you aren't very good with money and acting all badass calling me a keyboard commando sure doesn't make me shake in my boots.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Nick Baker it is actually vacation for many of them. It is a paid vacation because they will get back pay even though most aren't at work.  The ones who are working , I respect and they should get the back pay but there should be some furrowed because the government has to many non essential workers.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Nick Baker maybe the non essential ones should go find another job.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Nick Baker there is to much redundancy in government. They need to thin the ranks and actually make people work.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Valerie Spofford Tilley the USDA in Montana just called back all their staff to work for 3 days. They did this so they wouldn't be furrowed. One office in particular staffs 7 people vital they all get so much vacation time there is usually only 2 or 3 working. If that doesn't show non-essential I am not sure what does. That is what is happening all across government jobs.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Josh Gr worry about your own leader cupcake.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rod Novoa TDS has taken you. Only 6 more years.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Toni Scavo your brainwashing is complete sunshine. Bow to your democratic masters.,Kevin Lake... facts. Read and learn. Perhaps you should advocate not giving visas to anyone because a good majority  enter legally. A wall won't stop that.  https://www.npr.org/2019/01/16/686056668/for-seventh-consecutive-year-visa-overstays-exceeded-illegal-border-crossingsw
Linda Durbin oh yea sure, “working hard”... what action did he take after the Las Vegas massacre? Thoughts and prayers? 😑,Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens! 🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️
You can't drive vehicles through tunnels. Also tunnels cost the cartels a ton of time, money, and resources. Most importantly it slows them down.,Mr President have you heard of Tunnels.
Walls, fence whatever you call it slow people down allowing us to get there and catch them. Also stops drive vehicles from just driving through in places like AZ. Also need the Congress to change laws to stop the flow of people so we can focus on the bad guys.,Marjorie Anderson and the answer is?????????? Can YOU answer the question instead of acting like your cool aid master 😊
Sharon Fantana there is no big tech equipment that is going to physically stop a vehicle from driving over the border in a place like Arizona. Also if they have to build tunnels to traffic this takes time and resources of the cartels. We've been building barriers under the last several presidents. The fact is some people just dont like Trump and use it as an excuse to oppose him but that does not change the fact of what works down here and unless you have been out in the field chasing this stuff you really can't understand how much it slows them down for us to get to these places especially the more remote ones.  As far as Mexico paying for it. Like I said we've been building barriers and paying for it under the last several presidents. Now I have not read the full new deal that replaced  NAFTA but from what I've seen, been told, and understand is that we're getting a huge swing of money our way essentially paying for the wall. He never said they were going to dish out cash. There are other ways to make them pay. IR tariffs, new deals in our favor etc. People tend to be too narrow minded to think about those things because the mainstream media just pushes what they want. That's why it's more important then ever to do your own research and find the facts not just what they want to tell you.,Marjorie Anderson and the answer is?????????? Can YOU answer the question instead of acting like your cool aid master 😊
Hal Eric Mitlitsky With any luck that won't be for AT LEAST another 5 years. Hopefully more.,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Kathleen Reilly Mallia, it's not EVERYONE'S country, it's the LEGAL American citizens country!!! #BuildTheWall,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston, didn't sneak, they came here LEGALLY!!! You libs are truly delusional! #BuildTheWall,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston, thanks for leaving the country!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston, your blasphemy fits right in with the liberal ideology, pure hate and evil!!!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
William Bush, and it shouldn't!!! Sneak into this country and automatically get treated as a legal citizen is moronic, just like all libs!!! #BuildTheWall,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Lenny Anders You mean the Coast Guard?,Mr. President, 800,000 Federal employees and their families are being harmed by no fault of their own.  It has been 30 days or more since many of these government employees have been paid and many are required to work without pay.  That means paying for gas to go back and forth to work.  They are being held hostage in a political battle not of their making.  Many of these government employees work to secure our border, now without pay.  Please end this shutdown.  I support you on a strong border, but this is hurting our fellow Americans.
Morpheus three words for you idiot. WORLD WIDE WEB,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Dylan Clymore yes! 4 walls to be exact, but one wall might be made with vertical steel bars.,The wall will fix drinking and driving?.........
walls work. Stop being petty or take your doors off and let everyone in your house. Hahahaha,The wall will fix drinking and driving?.........
Brent Robinson those minority parties are so powerful!!!!!  So much for his being strong, effective, a winner.  Looks like he's a whining loser from this vantage.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Marcus Rech MS13 is an AMERICAN gang, fyi.,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Lynn Limauro Floyd what does the wall have to do with it?,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Paul Pietrantonio gimme a break.  He's a lying charlatan and you're defending him.,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!
Susan Dawn McGuire no, that one will go to the idiot who took PRIDE in not paying people.,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them. We see this in the recent drama from Buzzfeed. Absolutely amazing the reaction they had before they knew the truth and now after they know the truth. It’s a COMPLETE MELT DOWN.  WHAT A F——D up way to live!!!
It is meant to keep all illegals out, come in the right way, their are laws in place, look up illegal, if you don't know the difference.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Joanne Christie, i know for a fact when i have watched the president give a speach, and the next day cnn turns around what he says, to be a bought off democratic network. Use your eyes and ears, not some b.s. facts check the democrats have put in place...,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Cam go look in the mirror, you know nothing of what your speaking of. If it cost 5.6 billion dollars to build the wall, and it cost more than that to the taxpayers in one year to allow them to come in. You can't build half a wall, idiot, then police the other half. I hope for people like you, an illegal rapes or kills someone you love, maybe they will escape back to Mexico like the man who killed my nephew's friend. You democrats and liberals needed your asses whipped, go see if you can sneak into another country, and what theyed do to you if you got caught. If we'd allow everyone to come here and help them, we'd all have to work 24 hrs. a day to support all the freebies your political party keeps handing out. People like you amaze me at the lack of brains you have...,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
Sorry Cam,these messages are meant for Arev Neerg.,Joe Anderson  if you don't like our president move start packing
As a people you have to rise up and take your country back. Or it will never be the country you once knew. Stay strong...,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Sharon Fantana why don't you ask Israel who had a ton of enemies?,Marjorie Anderson and the answer is?????????? Can YOU answer the question instead of acting like your cool aid master 😊
It's ok if you don't understand politics just don't spew your stupidity around,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Well, that's nice and dandy, but the original text was not written in English but Greek and most likely referred to a Shofar. These were also blown when the walls of Jericho fell. The passage you quoted is talking about the resurrection, not a wall in the US.  National pride is the beginning of Babylon. That is coming from someone who lives in Germany. ;),let me know when you see it...... 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 King James Version (KJV)  51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  King James Version (KJV)
Gregory Baxter Are you suggesting men aren't killed by the guns in America?,How about all the daughters killed by Americans with guns, people that shouldn't have guns, what about that moeron?
Lisa Mann Not if you have military patrols on top of the wall complete with towers, gun turrets & fully equipped resource centers that the troops/ICE can use.  Israel's border wall does it's job quite well, I haven't lost a friend to a suicide bombing in over 10 years.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Curtis Rice that’s not how statistics work,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
We can come up with horrific stories about any group of people, and it will make them look bad by focusing just on them. Imagine reading posts about what white people have done to other people, u would want them out of the country as well.,Horrific stories and I cant believe most think there is no emergency.  There certainly IS.

Please explain to us in detail how this presidency is a fraud.  Give us some evidence to back up your claim.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
James Anderson If you’re thinking that bump stocks and large magazines should not  be illegal, that the legal age for purchase should not be 21, and that we should not improve access to mental health programs then you support the perpetrators of these mass shootings that constitute a real national emergency.,And the victims of Orlando, Las Vegas, & Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, what do they get? Oh yes, thoughts and prayers aka absolutely nothing.
Omar Martinez - Can you cite one?,I get all my news from Kremlin State TV, Rump’s Real News, Alex Jones, Fox and Friends, and The National Enquirer. Good to know I'm well informed.  So I know that if you want to buy a box of cereal, you have to have a voter ID and that Donald gave our soldiers a 10% pay raise. Mexican drug smugglers throw sacks of drugs over the fence and our people get hit on the head with 60 pounds of stuff.  I know the deep state has access to weather weapons capable of not only creating tornadoes but also moving them around, on demand.  I know that the government is using chemicals in order to turn people gay, using a mysterious "gay bomb" devised by the Pentagon. I know that no one died at Sandy Hook Elementary School because the Uniform Crime Reports showed no murders in Newtown for 2012 and the “victims” were child actors.  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/alex-jones-5-most-disturbing-ridiculous-conspiracy-theories.htmlAlex Jones' 5 most disturbing and ridiculous conspiracy theoriescnbc.com

Beverly Wurts we aren’t a nation based on any religion, but I’m sure you dropped out before middle school.,HELLO DEMOCRATS - You can not say a President is unfit to Lead the Country just because you disagree with him. We Conservatives thought Muslim Barrack Hussein Obama was unfit to lead America a Christian based Nation.
Bill Upham yes, let’s be Russia or North Korea. You idiot.,Simple solution to building the wall. Allow all illegals in, provide them with a “Welcome aboard package” which includes the immediate right to vote along with  affordable housing but they must agree in writing to register as Republicans/Conservatives then see how quickly Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the Resistance Party coughs up the $5 billion 🤔

The wall is going to bring a lot of savings once built but the point why some people don’t want it to be built? Keeping chaos fit the agenda of mafia organisations in any part of the world
Denise Malloy Davis if you don’t see that fat orange con needs to hire his daughter in law to spew his bullshit, sorry for you.,DEMONcrats no longer have OUR interest...just their own and it's not good for our country...they ALL need to be removed from office at this point....

Ed Basler how many of those are big pharmaceutical’s fault?,The Stable Genius was so correct when calling those who appose a wall liars. The Angel families must be heard, the 70,000 overdoses a year must be taken into account.  We must have a wall as part of Border security.

Gabriel Bergeron if you don’t support sensible gun reform, you don’t love the US.,It's hard to convince people who never had to felt it. Loosing something you were not suppose to. Do they need to see people they love die to understand that something isn't right?  To have saw it more than once, when it happen, YOU FUCKING CHANGES OF PERSPECTIVE. So now get the wall cause' lifes depent on it and you have all authority just look at all those case that the democrat CLEARY DON'T WANNA DEFEND.  But no problem defending illegal immigrants? And not building the wall?  IF YOU DON'T BUILD THE WALL THEN YOU CLEARY DONT LOVE THE US!

He’s bullshit.,Kim Miller I cannot see your comment

Margie Petrone FU,Before finishing the end of the wall,  please put all these liberal arrogant mockers on the other side. Starting with Pelosi.
Marie Phillips Licamele false. Idiot.,Build the wall and electrify it.  If they took care of business in the 1980’s we wouldn’t have 20 million illegal alien moochers that pay no federal and state income taxes and their employers dodge some taxes too.
Mark Schwendau I’d LOVE to see your credible link regarding this.,The MSM doesn't report the news any more but years ago the Mexican president released all his criminals from prisons so long as they left the country and went to America.  That explains illegal aliens of Mexico and crime.
Mark Schwendau you’re a lying liar.,The MSM doesn't report the news any more but years ago the Mexican president released all his criminals from prisons so long as they left the country and went to America.  That explains illegal aliens of Mexico and crime.
Mike Bowers please, explain to us all in detail how Mexico will pay.,Thomas Morton close the boarder and they will pay. Good thing I ain't president you folks would love me lol.
Owen Lamnea clearly, you have no idea what you’re talking about: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/politics/2019/01/08/president-trumps-desperate-nonsensical-claim-that-mexico-is-paying-wall/,What happens after the wall is built and illegal immigration is still a thing? Which hole are we gonna piss money into then?
Patty Bertocchini La Puma lying liar. You are 100% wrong. One officer was killed by an illegal immigrant. One. I’m not defending it, but you are wrong.

Steve Finigian you should research before dropping BS.,Why are dims against it, before they voted for it?

Susanne Grogan-Moore Yup, just look at who he hires.,illegal is Illegal.
Tex Hartness Dems offered him 25 billion in 2018. How is that not working with him?,I'm a Vietnam era veteran i had to salute the flag every morning and respect the President ireguardless of my political preference  why can't we find a way  to get  things  done  together instead of being one sided  if it matters im Republican but I've been known to have voter democrat
George Winn they offered 45 25 billion in 2018. He couldn’t art of the deal that?  Come on. He’s a loser.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.
Vicki Oldham https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/politics/2019/01/08/president-trumps-desperate-nonsensical-claim-that-mexico-is-paying-wall/,The promise is, “Mexico will pay for the wall.” Keep your damn promise.

Is your wife also a criminal and a drug addict, just like anybody you mention now, maybe she is since she is married to someone like you
Jeff An June Carnahan, please post a link of the missiles flying our way that trump stopped. Apparently the fake news media hid this story from us and only you can prove it.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Kevin Huth those countries that have walls are under attack by pretty much everyone omg . Walls are for war , which I'm sure trump already has a plan for how much he will make off it . More border security at all ports of entry is the issue . The wall is for you idiots 🙄,No other country has open borders why should we
Because they knew it was bullshit now they can blame the democrats,I don't understand why we didn't vote to secure our borders when the Repubs had the majority !!
Yes, just like I was against Obama's high level of deportations and his use of drones.,SIT DOWN DON, YOU FAT MOTHERFUCKER!!!Play Video
I am sorry that I didn't make your point for you.,SIT DOWN DON, YOU FAT MOTHERFUCKER!!!Play Video
I have also written several nasty letters to my very liberal senators regarding thier support of Israel.,SIT DOWN DON, YOU FAT MOTHERFUCKER!!!Play Video
I can tell you. You would blame Trump! Probably because the wall wasn't built fast enough!,Seems to me the people who don't want border security are the same people who should be on the other side of the wall. I see your dumb smiling faces. Let me ask you... what if your mother, sister, brother..etc was raped or killed by an illegal? Or for that matter overdosed on one of the many drugs coming from Mexico. Where would you stand then?
Steve Tash poor thang!,I’d vote for you all over again! #America

Leslie Kirscht-Sutton Holker lol, I probably know more about your country's limited history to understand that Trump as Presidents go is nothing short of a joke..and I'm here because your comment was funny..the thing is you and the rest of the world are likely to need some prayer because he is an incompetent menace to not only Americans but to the rest of us..you do realise your country is the one believed to be the biggest threat to global peace. That said.. Clinton was shite too..for the so called, self given 'greatest' country on earth you lot are clueless.

Bryan Davis the people on the border are actually suing Trump because they don't want the wall.,Sheldon Satchel  I don't see color brother only intelligence 😉
Every single thing below is verifiable.   This is why he is desperate to get the $5.6 billion:  From Donna Chaban-Delmas:  "This evening I would like to share something I just read, not my words, but those of someone who does his or her research before posting. What you will read here is a matter of public record.   This week we share with you a name....Roman Abramovich. (google him, we can wait....) Mr. Abramovich, a Russian national with Israeli citizenship, is an ally of Russian president Putin, and a personal friend of Donald Trump and his son in law. Mr. Abramovich is part owner (with several other Russian billionaires) of a steel company called Evraz - located in Canada - which, coincidentally, is the only one which can manufacture the specific type of metal beams Mr. Trump wants for his wall. (There was a Chinese company which could deliver the same product, but since Mr. Trump's trade war with China, they can no longer effectively provide it to the US.)  If the wall is built, Mr. Abramovich's company - in which Russian president Putin also happens to own stock through a complicated series of shell companies - stands to make roughly one billion US dollars during the first stage of construction alone. By the time the wall is completed, with costs estimated to run to almost 30 billion dollars (not 5 billion as the Republican parrots have been squawking), Evraz will likely triple in value.  This is of interest to Mr. Abramovich and his partners no doubt, since Evraz took a signifcant stock hit in early 2016, losing roughly 60% of its value....during the months leading up to the American Presidential Election.  Mr. Abramovich also owns a legendary yacht called the Eclipse, valued at roughly half a billion dollars.  Mr. Trump has been known to enjoy vacations on the yacht. One can safely assume the yacht has beautiful staterooms, with beds.  And showers.  And likely, given Mr. Abramovich's well-reported paranoia, there are plenty of security cameras in place....  Mr. Abramovich applied for Swiss residency some time ago, but was blocked by their government because of tangible evidence that he was involved in money laundering.  This is all public record. And it was presented to the media during the 2016 Election, when the press was slavering over Mrs. Clinton's emails and calling her "Killery".  But nobody listened.",NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Tim Baldwin https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCha7BwcF4itfzFr9DAUqdNw,MAGA!!!!!! They are going to say it openly, sooner or later, in the US.  The best policy for China is to liberate the North Korea. A free North Korean republic where the decimated 25 million 'half-animals' are born again as human beings  along the path of liberty, dignity and fair market! This will galvanize 1.4 bil. Chinese people. And also this will dismantle the moonJaeIn regime which is taking advatage of the false dilemma 'War vs. Peace'. Moonjaein, xijinping, and kimjongun are faithful servants and asslickers of satan
Sue Howie just like obama with his shutdown,Thank you Mr President for working so hard for us American citizens! 🙏❤️🇺🇸❤️

Peggy McGinnis it is photoshopped,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Sharon Joyce yup, Fox News being the most biased,ABC, NBC, CBS.. ALL 100% BIASED!
Cindy Gregg I'm about sick of lazy, entitled types like you. If you want something, you have to WORK for it.  Get off of your dead behind and go build it yourself if that's what you want so bad.,Matt Farus interviews with landowners in Texas show they will fight it.
Jill Travassos Just because you can shout at people doesn't mean they'll listen to you. :-|,Micheal, that's a good one.  Typical snowflake trump supporter.  You come to the discussion with no facts or information just verbal attacks...so very much like Trump you are in that way.
Tess Calomino Do all Republicans go to school to learn grammar and punctuation like you do?  If you're going to be all "WUHL HURDUR THIS ARE 'MERICA!" at least learn how to write the English language. :-/ For the love of God, lady...,Tim Gilbert . No crying here. Im satisfied with the results.
Will Croom Do you normally just say peoples' names back to them instead contributing to the conversation? :-/,Mickey Murcudgeon yes it seems really ridiculous to lock your doors on your house at night? just because we want a wall doesn't mean we're not putting a door in it dumbass.You want to come into the country you do it legally or don't come at all
Vicki Zamow and that's their biggest regrets but who cares people who want the wall are nothing but a bunch a bully redneck trashy Americans,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Give him a diapper that has the name Pelosi or Schumer on. But seriously Rod need urgent medication, he is suffering from TDS infection.

Joseph Roy lets see the parents befriended some. They are actually to blame. Hard to swallow yet logically if they had not, the child would never had been raped.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Ed Barnat hmm what is TDS?,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Nathan Berg well the thing is you can not prove it. And what your saying is a hyperbole.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Bill Reese unfortunate accidents happen all the time. This story is purely about blaming illegal immigrants. And I will still stand with that is petty. Might as well blame the place that made the beer, maker of the truck, whom sold them gas.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Robert Dahlquist You did not read the article. Its about how just being an illegal immigrant caused someone to die. Alcohol is mentioned (unknown where it came from), mentioned of out on bail for some assault( once again does not say from where) but does keep saying about immigration status, takes a potshot at cities that do not hand illegal immigrants over to ice (not police job btw).,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Jennifer Luthye thats the same thing. And is not what I said. I do not believe using immigration status as a reason someone would have lived or died.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Julie your not really clear what your trying to say.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Margaret Charlton get your ignorance out of your ears. There are more factors than a simple statement to blame immigration status or lack there of. There is no actual evidence that this accident occurred because of immigration status. Peoples simple logic of well, if they where not here in the first place does not pass any body of proof tests. Theses are the facts. Someone was drinking. Someone drove a truck. Someone died. Saying this was caused from them being here illegally is not evidence. Its opinion. Saying if they where not here in the first place is conjecture. I have far beyond a GED.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Ron O'Hearn no I am anti Trumps form of nationalism and the product that is starting to be produced here in America.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Ron O'Hearn pretty ghost knife,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Albert Kojo Kyekye Dems lose it when a black man likes Trump haha. Good on you Albert, stand strong against the hypocritical hate of the Left.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Deborah Bartlett  yes.... Mexico is a level 2 same as Germany, Italy, and Antarctica.   However, Mexico has more murders than all the other countries in the world combined!  It’s more danger than a level 2!,As we protect our country from people entering illegally,could we also raise the danger level of Mexico?   Our son was murdered there on vacation 3 months  ago.  The murder statistics are outrageous.   Statistics are higher each year.  There were 30,000 murders there in 2017 and 17,000 in US.  Mexico is 1/3 the size of US.   We need to investigate murders of our citizens in Mexico!

Because this is all false.,Unbelievably, Nancy Pelosi threatened to cancel the State of the Union address for fabricated “security” reasons while simultaneously refusing to open up the government because she doesn’t want security at the border. This only makes sense if you’re a liberal. 🤔
lol. Really? tRump inherited $40 million from his dad, filed bankruptcy 6 times, then convinced a small minority of Americans that he was a great businessman by playing one on a tv reality show.,I dont know if u r the real Donald J. Trump but good job! I wish I had even the slightest business smarts you have to grow my company!
tRump lies every time he opens his mouth.,Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Do you live on the border? Maybe we'll steal your land to build a wall on!,BUILD THE WALL! Thank you President Trump! 🇺🇸 👍
lol, ok. I'm sorry you are so easily conned.,Civil war is in the horizon . I stand with. My God , President . Country , And Flag
The borders ARE secure. We spend billions every year to make sure of that. Good luck with that.,issue? like what?
Kevin Couture dumbass,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Yeah I noticed how Canada built a wall.  And I travelled all over Europe and you couldn't go anywhere without running into a wall.  Even Russia has a wall.  Wait a minute.  Nope, they all have borders with no walls.  How can that be.  Do they know something we don't?   Check your facts.,No other country has open borders why should we
Skip Rowland guessing you don't have to live around meth toting Mexicans. instead all you retards are making it about race. try visiting one of the cities or counties that have been infested by methicans(aka drug mules) like my area. all you can see is addicts, murder, fighting and stealing. they are living in houses that aren't supposed to be lived in by anyone.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
And you yourself had immigrant ancestors,  wildrick derives from Germany.   Which last I checked.

Baron Von Brztekkenburg depends on who you asked!

Daniel Winget no he isn't.  And Abraham Lincoln had 38 Native Americans executed in 1861.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

John Sgouros ...and they won’t come,Build it!
Danny Jones. Yes sir. I don’t like say it. Now all Europe countries are invasion by millions of millions migrants every year. 99% are Muslim. Welfare. Medical. Housing. School. You taxpayers pay for them because Europe socialism give freebies to destroy culture. Look at German. French. Paris. Italy. Sweden. Spain. So many Europe countries are destroying by millions of millions migrants each year in Europe.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Ben F. Gilbert  speak for yourself you dummy.,Mr. Trump, No Americans dont want border security, they want you gone as president. Your a entertainer. Not a politician. You are making the presidency a entertainment place  Which many Americans are hurting because of your ways
That's is truly terrible what happened to you, both. But I would argue a wall doesn't fix these things as accidents happen from more than just illegal immigrants. Universal healthcare would certainly have helped with those medical bills though.  Apple - if CHP knew he came through Texas, then he couldn't have crossed illegally. If it was an illegal crossing then they couldn't know that, think about it. That really does suck, what happened to you, but clearly a wall wouldn't have prevented this from happening to you.,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, “Daniel Zuniga” who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didn’t take responsibility because they said they didn’t contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found. Find all underground tunnels coming into the US.  #BUILDtheWALL President Trump 🇺🇸
Did Daniel Zuniga illegally cross the border on foot in an area we dont currently have walls or come here legally and over stay their Visa?,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, “Daniel Zuniga” who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder.

Chris Hall "if it saves one life it's worth it" does that mean you are also in favor of stricter gun control laws since it will save at least one life? What about the lives of baby immigrants that have died in the custody of the government? Will we end the practice of family separation to save those one lives as well? What about the asylum seekers that would die if not granted asylum into our country? Will we reform our asylum and immigration policies to save those one lives? You say a wall of it saves one life is worth it... then you should apply that principle equally to all lives.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Dianna Lee a wall or lack of has nothing to do with enforcing our laws immigration or otherwise. So what exactly is your argument for related to Dave's sarcastic post? Wow you all are horrible at judging sarcasm or seeing the analogy between saying one person with a trait did something bad therefore everyone with that trait must be punished.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
What about all of the northern States like the one I grew up on that border another country and have no walls?  It sucks that you can't find a job with the skills you have, maybe try learning Spanish or move to a place where speaking Spanish isn't a job requirement... If 45 knows things we don't that make it crisis now that is more important than helping the Americans in California or Puerto Rico then why did it take so long for him to declare an emergency? Why didn't he do so in the first 2 years of his term when he was trying to get this done? It's not an emergency if you wait 2 years... Jim Jenkins - if control laws take lives, that blanket statement would mean you having a driver's license, being married in the government's eyes, or opening a bank account take lives... there are many countries with stricter gun laws that have lower crime rates. That point on gun control laws was also just simple way of showing that if you support a wall because it could save one person's life, then you should also support guns laws as they would save one person's life, or healthcare for all as that saves one life, or a full transition to renewable energy as that saves one life... more wall is a waste of taxpayer funds if it doesn't deal with the majority issues used to manufacture its need as an emergency, namely illegal immigration and drug smuggling.  Lastly saying that relatively few innocent people are killed by a gun is just plain nonsense. Try telling that to one family members that was killed in any number of mass killings in the last few years from Sandy Hook to Las Vegas concert goers... and stricter gun control doesn't mean law abiding citizens cant own guns, it just means they have to jump through a few more hoops. You loved your wife enough to file paperwork with the government declaring it, why cant you do the same with your gun? You wanted to drive bad enough you took a test showing you knew how to do so safely and show back up at the dmv every few years to reregister your license, why wouldn't you also do the same to own gun?,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Did this illegal immigrant even cross the border by ground or did they over stay their Visa or arrive by air or boat? A wall can only possibly stop one way of arrival, the most least used by illegal immigrants... a wall is stupid.,Yeah, no bias there...

Historically, walls aren't the most effective. Time after time throughout History, walls were built and failed. Walls didn't stop Alaric's sack of Rome in 410. Walls didn't stop the sack of Constantinople during the 4th Crusades. During the Medieval era, walls were built around cities and there were Catapults and battering rams and other siege weapons that destroyed those walls.  Read some of the historical texts from Locke and those who influenced the thought of Early Americans and the Founders.  I argue that if Washington and Jefferson were to be brought back in this era, they would argue that walls are not needed and not American. They would probably argue that after rising against kings and queens in their era to have a more Democratic system of government, that perhaps the next stage involves forming more partnerships with other nations and countries and that being Nationalistic and Isolationist is not the best direction for our nation to progress.  How about you study History and Theology and do Biblical exegesis instead of believing the lies of those in power and being driven by fear of those different from you. Go on a study abroad or cross cultural mission trip to South America and learn to appreciate the customs of those who we deem as the "other.",Meanwhile, you clearly don't listen to the voice of thevmany faith leaders and loving Christians in the United Church of Christ, Methodists, Presbyterians, Mennonites, Quakers and others who speak out against the wall. Even some of the Amish who are informed of current events speak out against the wall. It is not Christian to build walls.
Heather Love Leffel <- democrat slave troll, ignorant of how stupid they sound even when it is explained to them. The democrats will lose the house and fail to get senate, the republican majority will likely be large enough to destroy any filibuster, democrats will lose everything :) And there is nothing you can do about it. Illegals will be sent back, they will be forced to compete with the homeless and when they show up either dead from self defense when they try to rob a citizen or arrested they will get justice, the countries they came from will also be left to die as nature intended. And if you want to use the "European settler" defense, ask the Spanish who birthed the Mexican ethnicity what they did to the natives of literally half of america, all of central America and half of south America and the over 10 million African slaves they brought over, as American had merely 300k, how did mexico become such a shitty country? What is your excuse for these people who descended from soldiers who raped and murdered native people?,Wayne Denny absolutely

Use your brain!
Linda Lynch build that wall!!!!!!,Last year in the U.S. over 12,000 people were shot and killed by American citizens and Trump fights tooth and nail to prevent any common sense gun control. About a half dozen people are killed by undocumented aliens and Trump demands that we spend billions of dollars building a wall. I guess he doesn't think that it matters if your child is killed by a fellow American....I guess he thinks you will only mourn for them if they are killed by an undocumented person.

Roy Norwood it's over your head Roy, don't give yourself brain free.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Brent Robinson fact, you to can even look this up, worse monthly approval rating during his first two years then any President ever. True fact dumb dumb,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Buck Strunk what a dumbass,No other country has open borders why should we
Chris Ng tRump says climate change isn't real! Why oh why is he spending million to build a sea wall around his Russian financed Mar A Largo golf course???????,I notice everyone who says a wall is useless, senseless or stupid has walls in their homes. Some even have giant walls or fences around their perimeters.
Danny Jones no one ever said the Brits are a smart bunch.....ever😂😂😂😂😂😂,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Eva Graham you just might want to edjamcate yourself deary😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
James Begert educate yourself dumb dumb, only Congress can allocate funds,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Jim Damico so we are talking about STD's now,Just do an executive order and be done with it
Shirley Terry Harrow really, what about about the other 99.54% of the murders committed in this country by US citizens. Any thoughts and prayers on those. Anytime someone is murdered is tragic to say that Nancy Pelosi doesn't feel empathy for the family and friends who have lost some one to these violent act suggest that you yourself lack empathy, I hope not. Unfortunately we are seen as one of the most violent countries in the world. Praying that you find the love of Jesus in your soul once again.,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Stan Piznarski Stan the man at Bellevue mental hospital, how's it going girlfriend, still on those weekly ECT treatments I see,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Kevin Carlson is that you Obama,Build a wall on only one border. Looks to me like you don’t like the people on the other side, or why wouldn’t you build it on the Canada side too? You and your followers are motivated by the color of those on the other side of the wall you wish to build.
CNN fake news polls lol,Polls say building that wall is not that important to Americas
Bob Segal Term limits for congress is needed badly. Too much power is obtained as time accumulates and all those bastards re self serving. Also, I'm not even slightly convinced building that wall is going to change much of anything. Its another band aid that fails to address the source of the problems that cause people to want to leave central America and come here. There are other ways to approach this but nobody ever mentions them.,You lost my vote in 2020 with the antics over the wall. I'm not impressed.
We seem to loose no matter which party is in control Bob. By "we", I mean the average, working class people. I'm fed up with all of them in Washington.,You lost my vote in 2020 with the antics over the wall. I'm not impressed.
Albert Kojo Kyekye thats,Eric Wroblewski thank you
James Jerome the only ones that got caught rigging elections were rep in the carolina election,Let's have an official special issue vote for the border wall at local election sites.  Only those who can prove they were born in the U.S., or are legal citizens may vote.  No fake polls or rigged election.  No mail in ballots, or dead people voting.  Let's find out how many Americans support our President and really want this southern border barrier built.  If the public says to fund it, then the Congress MUST fund it.  My guess is that at least 3/4 of the whole population want the wall built.  Democrats are afraid of the truth!
He is a idiot and a constant liar,Americans want border security  not a wall
Mary Stone not in your life time,Americans want border security  not a wall
Larry Lubiner it's already begun. I bet you're one of the same over confident tools that says there was no way Trump would be President to begin with. Keep speaking in your absolute never, we'll keep laughing at your stupidity. Under the declarations he used, they can't stop them in court. So,, coming soon to a border near you, a nice big 50 ft. barrier, complete with sharpened spikes at the top,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Larry Lubiner it's spot on,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Betsy Hammond do you realize we could have all that, is the Democrats would stop wasting $150 billion a year in benefits and protection, for illegals. Not to mention the money they spend hiring lawyers to fight depression of illegals who are felons, sanctuary cities, etc.,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.
Charlesetta Brown there are tons of crimes by illegals that go unreported by media. And, you make the point for us supporters. We have enough home grown criminals to deal with, without opening the border for criminals from other countries. We have far too much crime as it is, and do not need more. So, your argument just worked against you. Thanks for playing, we'll see next week on the wall has begun,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.

140 Democrats last week voted against a resolution in Congress condemning the act of allowing illegals to vote in our elections.. While they've been screaming foreign interference, they've been the ones to admit it. They found nearly 2 million non citizens on the California voting registry. That's right, they are indeed, after saying they weren't, allowing illegals and non citizens to vote. That should be Trump's next EO. The only thing Cali agreed to do, was to remove the 153,000 dead voters on their roll, but they insist on leaving illegals, and non citizens registered. I don't know how this hasn't already been stopped, but the entire party, other than maybe Munchin, should be arrested, and brought up on  high treason charges,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Bobby Wilson keep them closed as long as it takes. Build the wall.,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Catherine Ott Walls are put where needed.,No other country has open borders why should we
,
85% of people who come in here illegally overstay their visas. And those people are Canadians. Why don't you build a wall on the northern border, you morons?,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
A 60-high foot wall that spans 1/6 of the border is equal to a door being open? You people are beyond insane. Not to mention he's never going to get it. He's going to be stuck in the courts for years.,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Stupid analogy.,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
These people live in Iowa or Kentucky and they have no idea what goes on at the border.,People dont realize that more Americans kill Americans than anyone else. Why isn't that being talked about? I live in El Paso. That stretch of road is known to have deadly accidents. It just so happened that this individual was an immigrant. However if it were to be any other driver, it would fit the propaganda, but here we are. The dad of the victim is even writing about walls in newspapers. Why not argue about slowing down the speed limit at that stretch of road? Why not argue that the city should install more security features? No. Your go to solution - only because this man is an immigrant - is to build a 5.7 billion wall. A wall which btw already exists in El Paso, where this happened. Yet, it still happened. Bet you didnt even know that info. Hell, I bet even after learning this info, you'll turn a blind eye and argue something random about a wall. Just think about your own hatred for a second. You're brainwashed and dont even realize it.
It must be  a Federal Emergency. Trump is playing golf.,Gods, you trumptards falling for this three-hankie story.  You idiots need to live in N. Korea. They have a very, very, very, secure southern border!  With its own dictator, you'll be truly happy there!
Completely agree, Charlesetta.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
I thought the same thing. Trump is disgusting. His supporters are sycophantic dogs.,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Including all the gun deaths that are created by Americans like in Illinois yesterday?,Even one death is to many !🇺🇸
How about the killings in Illinois yesterday? Would a wall have prevented that? Would a wall have prevented the shootings in Parkland? In Aurora?,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Was he a drug dealer or gang member?,An illegal killed my dad years ago..
And Trump understands and cares for you. lol. Ask a farmer how much he cares.,We support you and fully agree with you!!! Build that wall because Congress and the Democrats don't know how the rest of us live and go through. The rest of us don't have a security detail or the money to invest in high quality security systems.
Omar Martinez just what I said build the damn wall keep illegals out!,Build the wall mr president
Ed Schaeffer https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/border-patrol-wall-immigration-trump-senate-democrats.html,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Sheila Lessing Turn off Alex Jones. There are not enough illegals voting to effect the election for dog catcher.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.

Dodd Gross but who is being investigated? Not Obama and not Hillary. And your idiot president thinks there is a wall around San Antonio. It doesn't get any more stupid than that.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Corrupt bastards like Cohen, and Manafort, Kushner, Eric, Ivanka, Jr. If you surround yourself with crooks you are probably a crook.,Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.
Hazel Ramey how's that working out for you? 🤣Republicans investigated Hillary for 4 years and $250 million and came up with nothing. Comey and Rosenstein are Trump appointees just like Cohen (guilty on 8 felony counts) and Manfort (guilty on 8 felony counts). Steele is a former MI6 agent, (British intelligence for you ignorant Trumpanzees). Clinton was already impeached for lying to congress as he should have been. So when does Trump get impeached for lying to congress and everybody else on a daily basis?,Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.
David Owens Jeffcoat Yeah, proposals like arming teachers so when the cops arrive they will probably shoot some teachers too like the bar security guy the cops killed thinking he was the killer.,Build the Kate Steinle memorial wall "NOW!"
Greg Pyles move to Russia, comrade.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Joaquín de la Maria How is screwing around on all three wives, lying constantly, screwing contractors, not paying loans, not knowing one single actual Biblical quote, being a sexual predator, having a charity shut down for fraud and running a fake university doing God's work?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Wayne Elam Jr. $150 billion that was already Iran's money held under sanctions. FYI, the money sent to Iran was from weapons that Reagan sold them to fund his illegal Central American death squad but he only delivered half of the weapons he sold to the known terrorist nation. Look up Iran/Contra and stop being such a gullible dupe. Turn off Hannity and Rush, the two uneducated ex-dj's.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Marie Garcia,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Harold Meinster, is that true or did Trump tell you that?,So many of us are with you.  Two more caravans are coming.  Declare an emergency and get it done.  Lets the courts battle it out.
Kristy Sokoloski https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lincoln-dakota/,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Susan Diane 1. you are ten times more likely to get killed by an American white guy than an illegal immigrant. 2. No one is born here illegally. If you are born here you are a US citizen. Check the constitution. 3. There are many more American crime gangs than illegal immigrant gangs. 4. Every immigrant, even illegal ones pay sales taxes, income tax and social security. They don't get tax refunds nor are they eligible for social security benefits.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Victoria A. Deobald I thought you republicans love Israel. FYI, Israel has terrorist lobbing explosives into Israel. We don't have terrorists lobbing explosives over the boarder. That is a piss poor argument.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.

Lillian Weisberg he doesn’t know what work is. Your also accepting a liar. But that’s who you want to support shame on you,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Mark Parsons yeah right. I guess that's why your boy Manafort is getting ass raped in prison right now.  Military traitor Flynn is singing to Mueller at a very high decibel level to avoid giving up the booty.  Jared and Don the Con, Jr are next, then the retarded kid.  Keep denying.  Anyone that supports this crook is also a traitor.,What are you talking about?? Putin is in the White House.
Carolyn Alexander probably because Dotard sits on his fat A— and DOES ABSOUTLY NOTHING!,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
How long have you been THAT STUPID Trumptard?,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Lee Grant...congratulations! You have just gone to the head of the Trumpkin Bumpkin Class of Stupidity and Delusion! When Humpty Drumpty is thrown out of office...of that there is NO DOUBT....there will be rejoicing in streets across the nation and you illiterate, brain dead Trumptards will be wailing into your China made MAGGAT hats!,As a citizen of the United States I demand that you resign the presidency and take your Serwer Rat Cabinet, the Republithug eunuchs, and your criminal family with you MORON!
Make love on guns .I dare you .in fact if your sooo convinced .then rather than use government forces to enforce your views come take my guns yourself,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
If you ask the American citizens on the border they will say otherwise,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
And u know this how?,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
All I'm going to say is El Chapo smugglers said they don't get drugs in this country the illegal way... They drive straight through... Every body keep saying the wall will make us safe, keep drugs out this that or another, but if a person wants to get drugs into the country or they just want to come to the country they will find a way... Far as the drugs go, the drug of choice now that such a crisis is opioids and those come right from the doctor... Weed is damn near legal almost every way, and crack has always been around... Now make us safer naw I don't by that because illegal immigrants aren't doing majority of the killing and other crimes... But if you think having a wall will make you safe that's your opinion, but ask all the mass shootings victims family would a wall have made a difference for them...,I notice everyone who says a wall is useless, senseless or stupid has walls in their homes. Some even have giant walls or fences around their perimeters.
Amy Hays I Agree with you.  I was being sarcastic when I said let’s give them money instead of a wall. I’m tired of everyone blaming Trump. It’s their government they should fix their side of the road. These countries should be up to par with the U.S. by now.  Right?,? People are fleeing their countries because they are afraid they are going to get raped or killed., right? Or to get a better job or education?  —why don’t the higher ups or leaders in those countries do their jobs! and make it a safe and prosperous place for their people to live!! Instead of building a wall...Use the money to make those countries civilized instead of acting like barbaric assholes!  I don’t get it. Enlighten me please.
What a ridiculous statement by Godfrey.   All the people in our country killed by illegals is something to be taken very seriously.   Those are the facts.     I pity a person who believes any of the lies that the Democrats push.   They are the ones who are truely sick people.   They want to protect a criminal over a decent, good American citizen.   There is something very sinister about their agenda.   It is an agenda of power....all power....absolute power corrupts.   Communists is what they have turned into.  The  old Democrat party of Kennedy is dead.,Mitchell James lol didn’t bother looking did you
Lisa Palmer Fleming thank you for calling me a dimwit - it shows how kind you are,Marcie Pavy what is then?
Marcie Pavy what is then?,Marcie Pavy what is then?
Gary Coggins well since he lost the popular vote I guess you’re right. But that base ain’t growing it’s shrinking,Your approval rating is at 39%. Open our government
Lonny Watters huh??,Your approval rating is at 39%. Open our government
Joani Pakula , it scares me how many are not aware of that document, or do not take it seriously. They are well on schedule with the plan. Populous MUST wake up before it's too late!,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Brian Bray isnt FORCING ALL Americans to purchase and have health insurance no matter if you can afford it or not, socialist?,She looks more like a fish.
Jim Scott I have found that people who use insults do so because they are not adult enough to hold a civil conversation!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Charlesetta Brown dumbest comment today,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Jamie Rochelle if we had the wall less people have to lose their families, less Americans have to grieve....but you dont care about them....right?? Until that illegal goes and gets drunk and kills your family....we dont hear about that because they dont collect that data.,Sharon Et Trina Bratley Exactly!!  Thank you.
Jim Popper it's not fear mongering.....its common sense, but what do libtards know about that??,Be afraid. Who just shot up his workplace yesterday killing five? Stop the f*cking fear mongering you idiots.
Joseph Nowik which will be declared illegal and unconstitutional,  it by that time the wall is built.... the man is a genius....checkmate!!,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Kelli Annette Smith we are looking to lock up stupid people...what's your address. This is a about strange people sneaking in to hurt people....did ya see all those Angel Moms?? Did you see the families that didnt have to grieve?,An America killed my best friend where should we build a wall to keep out?
Michael Collins if a 1000 of those stories came out a week would u change your mind??  You dont hear them because they are not allowed to report it was an illegal responsible for traffic fatalities. Where I am we have had 3 cases this week, and I am not in a high immigrant area.,An illegal immigrant killed one of my friends, I don’t blame them all for it. That’s stupid. The choice of an individual doesn’t reflect all of them
Mike Marsh yay....,Remove democrats for obstructing
Peter Richards omg....please tell me you were being sarcastic....33% is 1/3. 31% is pretty freaking close...no one could be that stupid...right??,Trump lies for example in the sotu he said one out of three women in the caravans are molested.    The mainstream media looked into it and found trump lied.     Only 31 percent of women in the caravans were found to be molested!  Impeach trump and lock him up!
Pourk Hammur you're a mindless weirdo...does the group home know you are on the computer again??,Yesterday, there was a National Emergency.... Today, you're hanging out, playing golf, stuffing your gullet with hot dogs.... There's no "National Emergency" or "border crisis", you're not fooling anybody except your inbred, mouth-breathing base...
Worley Michael and the US has cameras, drones, barb wire, and motion sensors what's your point moron??,Wendi DelValle liar.

Roy Meston  You seem to think you know a lot about drugs in prison. You are either an ex con or a guard that smuggled drugs to inmates in your prison wallet.. Drugs aren't as easy to get into prison as cell phones are..and from the sounds of it, you could fit a dozen Obama phones in your "wallet".,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston  How did you get human and drug trafficking across the border from my statement?  I was pointing out the obvious Liberal bs of your repeated statement about walls around a prison don't  stop drugs from getting in as an argument against a border wall.. Keep up dude..,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Barbara Hill The wall will not stop them from using boats to get here,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Karen Edwards They also forgot they they can come by boat,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Patrick Benthin And everyone of those country's have major immigration problems,No other country has open borders why should we
You all think they get paid weekly, you are fools, they get paid once a year.,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Mike Keck, how many of those children were killed by legal citizens, I willing to bet 90%,I bet every Angel Mom would go without a paycheck in exchange for having their child back!
Maria Lopez Not even one of your friends say ,you are smart,Thank you Mr. President. #BestPresidentInYourLifeTime
He won't Joseph his daughter in law was on Hannity last night & said so!!!,Don’t give in Mr President
Great responses!!! Love my President Trump !!!! Maybe we might need to consider a wall on other borders as well like Canada since they hate us so much!!!,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
I wish that was true Tony I can use the money!!!,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
If America & President Trump is such a laughing stock then why in the hell do we waste money on helping everyone else all over the world???? Cry babies wouldn't survive that's why y'all need us more than we need you so stop calling us !!!!,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Sarah it astounds me on who would want to go to Canada!!!!,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...

Stephen Pierson  U R A F*ING Communist!,Thank you Mr. President. #BestPresidentInYourLifeTime
Kathy Finley Hayden do you know what it takes to immigrate legally to Canada ? My Lebanese family , applied and they had to pass a French test , a medical test , wait 10 whole years before their papers arrived then they only had one month timeline to land in Canada ... illegal immigration is not allowed in Canada or in any other country in the world ! Stop with the hypocrisy ! Why should illegal immigration be allowed in the states ? Love your country more than you love your party guys and stop finding excuses to illegal behavior ! Shame !!,No other country has open borders why should we
Paul Burton give me one single country in the world , including third world countries where illegal immigration is allowed and no punishable by law . Waiting ...,No other country has open borders why should we
Shamir Dehghani only an idiot would state that , I don’t think you ever traveled to Europe because if you are talking about he Schengen status here’s how it works : if you want to immigrate to any of the Schengen countries LEGALLY , you need to apply for a visa in one of those and land FIRST in the country you took the visa from , then you can go from Schengen country to another freely , ONLY if your visa states MULTIPLE ENTRIES on it ! If NOT , the only country you can go to , is the one you took visa for . Now those Schengen countries signed a deal with regulations that makes them like different states . You sure have open borders from one state to the other but as long as you came to the states altogether , LEGALLY , in the first place . Got it ? Ignorance at its finest !,No other country has open borders why should we
Stephen DeVoy give me one country , one single country that allows illegal entry to its territories ... when I lived in Copenhagen I would take the train to malmo Sweden twice a week for Work , and do you know how many check points there were ? One before boarding the train , another one ON the train and one last upon arrival ... you should always have your passport on you ... I believe it is YOU who have never traveled so zip it !,No other country has open borders why should we
John Ulsh yes and if I enter Canada illegally, am i breaking your Canadian laws or not ? Also , do you have any idea what it requires to immigrate legally to cabana ? FYI,No other country has open borders why should we
Betsy Hammond those things should have been taken care of long before now! Once all the illigles are not getting resources the legal people should get it.,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.

Buck Strunk we don’t have open borders 🙄,No other country has open borders why should we
Jill Travassos - where did you get that number- give me an actual citation please.,And all of you want the wall built- how? Taking away land from U.S. citizens that the wall would have to cross? Interfering with migrating animals? We have more problems with people coming in on airplanes than we do with southern border crossings.
Gregory Baxter More people die from illegal and prescription drugs and medical mistakes than guns in this country. You people really need to get off gun BS cause guess what Guns aren’t going any where. They are in our Constitution. Illegal immigration is NOT.,How about all the daughters killed by Americans with guns, people that shouldn't have guns, what about that moeron?
Jackie Lee Collins More People die from drugs than guns. Stop with the gun comparisons.,And a US citizen shot up Columbine, Shot up Parkland, don't get me started on Eric Robert Rudolph, or Ted Bundy. American Terrorist attack at the 96 Olympics in Atl. Yeah our prisons are filled with Americans. Whats your excuse now? Try again.
Charles Boyd JFC another delusional one who believes in the communist utopia of no guns except for the govt will keep us safe BS. Guess what- the govt doesn’t give a damn about you. You are a liability to them and liabilities are expendable. Learn your history boy.,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Elizabeth Burton Steere Trust me. You are not the majority. You think you are. Try checking out the #walkaway movement. It has been growing fast and strong.,We The People stand with you!
Sherry Carruth Pelosi has a choice to come to the table. She has refused to do so. Her job is to negotiate a resolution. She refuses to do so. She refused to attend the last two meetings. She wont respond to this last comprise. She now owns this shut down.,We The People stand with you!
Diane Ohlzen with every president. Don't you find it strange that Bush was for it, Clinton was for it, Obama was for it, Schumer was for it, Pelosi was for it. All were for it until Trump went into office. Hmmmm,We The People stand with you!
Matt Bachugan so donate your tax check to help nuild the wall,Ryan Wasajewski 1. A large trampoline is around 500 to 600 dollars 2. Itd make trump a criminal to not pay taxes 3. Damn son wered you get that diss almost hurt my feelings
Do you feel like all the drugs that have been pouring into this country and all the gun runners crossing into America and the gangs that keep people from leaving their homes after dark speaks to being safe?  There was a day when parents were not fearful of the kids playing ball in the yard or walking to the corner store for a treat OR the ice cream man? Today children are not free to live like the days of yesterday because this is now the home of drugs evil and destruction.  It is a terrifying place for people.  We are no longer the home of the free.  We are not free.  We are slaves to our government and the other riff raff who do not belong any place but prison or sent to the place they ran from to bring terror and destruction to a place that was once proud and strong and clean.  If government would do the job we elected them to do without being the greed ravaged froup it has become America could be great again.  But the Lord will have to return to clean up the mess now.,I QUESTION, HOW IS ALL THE DIVISION AND THE HATE AND FEAR MONGERING AND EVIL THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? IS THIS “THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE”? GOD BLESS AMERICA? COULD GOD SOON BEGIN TO WONDER WHY? IS AMERICA BECOMING NO LONGER WORTHY? IS THE END NEAR? IT’S TIME TO CHANGE TO PLEASE GOD!

Coleman...Now I understand why you are an idiot... you were in the Navy!!!!,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
You are working to hard for the American people but we love you keep up the good work,President Trump you are the best president I have ever seen , I am a hard worker  and have lost my insurance after I wAs told I was grandfathered in i am so tired of people who want something for nothing  theirs lot's of people who want me to start a militias to stop this night   MAre
Brenda Flores it would take an idiot to vote for the new Marxist democrats,I can not believe Beto said he would abolish the Constitution today! He said no one follows it anyway! If that is NOT a verbal acknowledgement that the Democrats are trying to eleminate our laws.. Which is TYRANNY!  That verbal statement shows that we are fighting a domestic enemy! These people slipped through our system that failed to prosicute these people for their self confession of taking out the constitution! Why arent you people holding those accountable for stating this is their agenda..  And they sit in as a member of congress who are allowed to make laws and change them.. And no one is doing anything about it? Why? We demand answers!
James Hindle shut up, boomer. Your generation screwed up America...let it heal from your cancer,Oh, go grow one, Donald. Your most important duty was pretty null and void when you deferred . . .  what was it . . .  five times? What a useless excuse of a man!

Kerry Flint Button wait...he’s not a communist imbecile like the neo-Bolsheviks of the left,You are the greatest danger to our country.
Larry Vincent as a non elitist working class Republican...if any harm comes to President Trump...Yellow Jackets of France will be like chunky cheese to your world,As a citizen of the United States I demand that you resign the presidency and take your Serwer Rat Cabinet, the Republithug eunuchs, and your criminal family with you MORON!
Lee Mcclelland maybe you should get a job and put your moms basement,Because a person willing to kill people is going to look at a wall and say “oops, look at that ... getting past this would be illegal, I should stop here.”
Kingsley Medland dude...you’re British slime. What a dumbass,GOD BLESS YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP, BECAUSE HE SURE BLESSED US WITH YOU!!!!  <3
Charlie Daboub liar,I'll vote for that man in 2020 also! BUILD THE WALL!  And anyone that doesn't like the wall or the idea of it should go live on the other side of it
Jeremy Stephens From leftist communist is what he saved this country from.  Old elitist and idiot ghetto queens are the only democrat base...all communist,thanks for saving the country
Charlie Daboub that’s not how appropriations work, idiot,Democrats are now an adversary of the U.S. and like any enemy of the U.S. they care nothing about National Security and Public Safety..
Ramon Rodriguez you could self deport...as an option,This is about your ego buddy

Ernie Hildebrand what????,Liar, con man, Russian asset
Lee Grant   My moms dead and I’ve been working and living on my own for a around 15 years now 🙂,Because a person willing to kill people is going to look at a wall and say “oops, look at that ... getting past this would be illegal, I should stop here.”
Latest polls show support for his wall is just shy of 35%. Half is a bit of an exageration.,Its seems elementary, but its seems half the country wants to stay in Kindergarten for a lifetime........🙈
Nick Amato , they don't have open borders. I needed a passport and they questioned us when we visited. I couldn't just walk on over.,No other country has open borders why should we
barbara your full of crap!,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!

Dave Mosley Jr. The only one dilusional is you.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Gary Kane idiot,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you are the problem of this great nation,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you are the problem of this great nation
Stephen Pierson why not they all have agreed to a wall before Trump asked for one?,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
John Wheeler but do you know how many illegal s are getting paid with our tax dollars? And Pelosi is keeping it shutdown not Trump he wants it open.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Charlesetta Brown yes, we have enough of our own problems. Why bring in the rest from the world?,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Arturo Elroy Mañana you're a "MORON"!!,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Janey Renteria I am saying if you don’t love this country and want to protect it against illegal invaders, then yes, you are not a patriot. Sorry if the truth hurts your little feelings 😩😆🤣,We true Americans are behind you 1000%, Mr. President!
A federal government who operates a catch and release program for illegals does not have the moral high ground to go after sanctuary cities.,Help me understand something... The South seceded the US for States' Rights (1861-1865) and the US Army promptly invaded, and after the bloodiest (4) years in history, the US said "No to States' Rights" by force. Now, we have New York, California and others who are demanding States' Rights for a range of things like illegals, marijuana, sanctuary, etc... costing the country way more than the taxes and tariffs imposed on the South (even with inflation) and the US does nothing? Am I missing something? And don't make this about slavery...it wasn't. Both President Lincoln and Gen. Lee are quoted, many times, that it was never about slavery. That's a myth. My point is simple, why allow states to reject US laws and nothing is done? Why are their actions not considered treasonous and criminally obstructive? Why not march the US Marshals in and arrest all those state and local politicians for Obstruction?
The government will reopen next week most likely Monday, that will mark 30 days so just relax.,OPEN THE GOVERNMENT! #TRUMPSHUTDOWN #NOWALL
Automatic weapons such as the AK-47 have been illegal in this country since 1937 so there is no need for legislation to outlaw them.,My neighbor was killed by a white male with an AK automatic weapon. In fact so many more have been killed with assault rifles that trump and the GOP are ignoring the REAL security crisis.
These children are not locked up, they are living in a dormitory setting with beds, food, clothing and medical care.  They are being taken care of better than their own families who abandoned them.,I’m currently watching a tv show called  border force America’s gate keepers. You should be ashamed as you are locking up unaccompanied children crossing the border from Mexico, I understand that you don’t want or need drugs and weapons crossing the border, but these are innocent children, and you decide to lock them up. Shame on you trump 😡  You are the most corrupt person currently on this planet, you need to be taken out of your position, and very soon
Yes, remember when Pelosi said we have to pass the Obamacare bill to be able to see what's in it.,Pelosi has Alcoholic Dementia, she needs to go to rehab!!!! That's a start to securing our borders.
Agree, it will be interesting to see how many Democrats will be missing from the SOTU because they have been indicted.,Thank you Mr. President for all you do for us.  The letter Nancy wrote to you uninviting you for the State of the Union, should you decide the wall is a crisis, proves Nancy thinks it's a crisis too. All the proof you need! She drew that conclusion without even conferring with Homeland security and other top officials!
Ambien and vodka,I don't know how how she sleeps at night.
Yes because people in their 50s/60s remember a country without these problems. After Israel built their wall, terrorism decreased by 99%, so walls work, even the least intelligent among us know that,Haha most who supports the wall seem to be in late 50-60s with no actual understanding of how it works.
Since Israel built their wall, terrorism in the Jewish state has decreased by 99% which proves that walls work, even the least intelligent among us understand that.,Except the wall won't work.
Relax, the shutdown will be over in a few days.  Pres Trump needed a 30 day waiting period before he could fire all the useless employees and saboteurs in the bloated bureaucracy.,Mr. President, 800,000 Federal employees and their families are being harmed by no fault of their own.  It has been 30 days or more since many of these government employees have been paid and many are required to work without pay.  That means paying for gas to go back and forth to work.  They are being held hostage in a political battle not of their making.  Many of these government employees work to secure our border, now without pay.  Please end this shutdown.  I support you on a strong border, but this is hurting our fellow Americans.
Relax sunshine, the shutdown will be over in a few days.  Pres Trump needed a 30 day waiting period before he could fire all of the useless employees and saboteurs in the bloated bureaucracy.,The end of the month is almost here and people who are renting are gonna get evicted because they are not going to be able to pay rent..  but Trump has a big ass roof over his head....
You really need to learn sentence structure, it will give you some semblance of credibility.,Look in the mirror for shame
Nobody really cares who you vote for.,Thomas Harrington kermit the frog would be a better choice at this point and he's a real puppet. You sir are the DMF.
There is no solution for a viable affordable healthcare system in a country that has a 40% obese population.,How about that promise to fix out broken healthcare system?
A congressman's salary is peanuts compared to how much they make on the side in payoffs.,Cut the Senator’s and Congessmen’s pay during the shutdown and things will start to work your way
There is one reason Travis that Pelosi is in a high position and that's money.  Pelosi represents a very rich district and she is the best fundraiser in the Democratic party.  She makes the Democrats a ton of money so they keep her around.,How the hell is Pelosi still in her position? Total incomprehensible!   Who does she represent in this REPUBLIC?
Larry Boydston well, god loves sinners so Trump must be loved,Larry Boydston well, god loves sinners so Trump must be loved
Where is Hinkley to finish the job??,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
I'm guessing you don't live in the EU. Here everyone has open borders and every country is full of immigrants. It's fucking awful,No other country has open borders why should we
Patty Bertocchini La Puma that only stands to reason because US citizens outnumber ILLEGALS like 20 -1 but let's not ignore the fact that they dont belong here and are a drain on taxpayers, government resources,  and our economy.  The fact that they kill and rape people is only 1of the many reasons to keep them out do you have a fence around your house? Doors with locks on your house ? Same thing,Steven Reeves I was raised Republican and then I grew up and RANAWAY
Patty Bertocchini La Puma I do care but those stats are not accurate killed is killed not by a human hand,Steven Reeves I was raised Republican and then I grew up and RANAWAY
Patty Bertocchini La Puma that is one officer who would be alive if that illegal immigrant wasn't in this country to begin with,Steven Reeves I was raised Republican and then I grew up and RANAWAY
Patty Bertocchini La Puma you people just dont get it we dont want the illegal immigrants here period.  I dont care if they kill people or dont if they ride around on your democratic unicorns and spread love lol they dont belong here BUILD A GIANT WALL ha ha not sure why the Democrats are so against securing our boarders oh I know because then they'd have nobody to vote democratic ha ha not sure how you people are going to handle 6 more years of TRUMP,Steven Reeves I was raised Republican and then I grew up and RANAWAY
Brent Robinson , Do you feel the same way about gun control so that there aren't  ANY  MORE mass shootings but because it done by WHITE AMERICANS LET THEM KEEP HAPPENING,,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Brian Bray , So true but you see  that OK because it FEAR MONGERING and they were POC don't count in his book,She looks more like a fish.
David Williams , FACTS Printed, able to verify asking because worked in that field for 20 years . How about 4 generation in one family milking the system that fine with you , getting benefits just by getting a doctor signing a letter another mom and 4 kids collecting money they never paid into making more money in a month then I did $4000 and then being told that if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have a job last name Conner,3 billion in tax returns to illegal aliens with no social security number under child credit act, billions In social services to illegals, Billions In aid to countries that don’t help. Politicians getting paid while front line doesn’t, What a screwed up system, 4 billion for a wall can’t be anymore ludicrous then the other stupid crap going on.
Frank Betty Page , and 45 is mentally sound HA,HA,HA, all his womanizer has gotten to him,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
No, that would be 45 a very serious mental problem,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
So true European didn't understand why American military members acted like FOOLS when they drank, rape, when they could go down to RED LIGHT DISTRICT, we could sent our preteen to buy beer at the TRINK HALLE  and they brought home, the USA LOOK at everything as a mortal sin,I'm sad to hear this but American's do drugs\drink and then get behind the wheel and drive too. Remember Mother's Against Drunk Drivers?
Brian Ivinjack , What color was the nut that walked into the bank killed five women for no reason, who shot up the schools, Las Vegas, Jewish Temple, black church or did I miss something , ran over the young lady in VA, John Grady over 20 young men, Bundy, Tim Mcvey,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Ronald Bettney Are you or anyone you know  affected by shutdown or you  the  top 1% who could care less about working families,Keep up the good work. We are rooting for you. Build the wall.
Teraza Parrish , Thank you,HOW MANY AMERICAN SONS WERE KILLED BY TIMOTHY McVEIGH? THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER? THE SHERMAN OAKS SHOOTER?? SANDY HOOK?? LITTLE CHILDREN?? BY WHITE AMERICAN MALES!!??? TRUMP DOESN’T CARE ABOUT AMERICAN PEOPLE - HE ONLY CARES CARES ABOUT AMERICAN DOLLARS!!
Mike Donovan hey DUMASS that part of government not shut down.,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
Norene Boone oh that's smart spending year's and millions on something that's been approved by them for year's. I guess democrats are ok with just wasting the money in some other country that it would take to build the wall.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Buck Strunk No it doesn’t. The biggest wall in the world is the Great Wall of China. The Vatican has a wall like many town/ cities in Italy when it was made up of city states prior to becoming a nation. Lots of cities across Europe have walls, built during the medieval period not this century or the last. Examples such as the Vatican  are not a valid comparison to Trump’s plan.,No other country has open borders why should we
If you don’t want the wall move out of America  you don’t belong here. We want the wall demon,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Heather Gurtlinger he lied about the 4000 people that were criminals arrested at the southern border, only 12 of those 4000 came from the southern border, he lied to the American people every day he lies to his wives about how many times he cheats on them, then he lies about paying off the whores that he cheated with, he lies about hiring the best people, he hires crooks and that's it. He lies about knowing the most about everything he ever possibly talks about, because he doesn't know a damn thing about anything, except for running businesses and countries into the ground and bankrupting them. He lied about getting a one million dollar loan from his father to start his business because he already had over 8 billion dollars at that point from all the tax fraud him and his father committed. He lied about being a Christian, the only time he's ever been in a church is for a photo op or to try to talk the hypocritical evangelist into supporting him. I could go on and on, but you've obviously drank the kool aid and you're too stupid to realize when you're being lied to, that's why Trump says he loves the poorly educated he likes them stupid, so they believe his lies.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Jackie Capps did he ever wants to clear a national emergency when there was actually no emergency illegal border crossings are at an all time low and the amount of illegals in the United States is also at an all-time low, so where exactly is the fucking crisis?,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Matt Smith the drugs are coming through in tunnels that go under walls and through legal points of entry that is well known fact that every border agent has stated.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Lorilynn Bauer  I know there's some big words in this, but it's from Forbes magazine, which is a lot more accurate than your photoshopped pictures, see if you can get someone to read this to you and then you'll understand, and I'm not your baby girl, bitch.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Becky Geyer Price nobody is perfect. Only Jesus Christ, and he knows that! Its whats in your heart.,And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.             Thank you Jesus for Trump and Pence.
Kingsley Medland, why are you here?  Apparently you don't have a clue how huge a bullet this country dodged with the victory of Donald J. Trump. So, why are you here?  🤬,GOD BLESS YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP, BECAUSE HE SURE BLESSED US WITH YOU!!!!  <3
Dave Heffner or TDR.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Jason Kustra It was caught on camera rude person.,Several thousand illegals climbed over a fence into New Mexico last night and no one stopped them...several thousand mostly men.  Build the Wall!
Trust the Emperor, he delivers and protects,Leung Freuy our God Emperor speaks
Yes that's correct.,Leung Freuy our God Emperor speaks
How about gifting that £5bn to the NHS, you Brexiter muppet coward?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Sabryna Klug At one time in my life I had to use the system. What was surprising was you got raises for not working. More money financially and for food. I didn't even have another child. Thats why people stay on it, you're spoiled, why work.,We need to get rid of welfare.food stamps  , subsidies on housing,wic ...get a job and pay for yourself....the the people that work every day are tired of supporting all these people....use that money it more the enough to pay for the wall and to make America great again ...Americans can have free education and medical for all the money we give away to people who don't work  ...make them work like the rest of us...I dont work my Bill's dont get paid it's that simple
Rob Egerton  So we are just supposed to add to the problem with doing nothing about the southern border?? Your whatisms don't work here!,Far more Americans are killed each year by fellow Americans - especially with guns, but he's not bothered about them.

Open your mind and educate yourself!,This a reps job to make a mess bring in the dems for a whileblame then for their inability to clear up yearsbeyond years of rep damages and get played as the puppet for the chaos so a rep can stand back in and act like a hero so fucking abusive man
Nick Valenti . Call me a radical. This in my eyes is not a tantrum.  Try reviewing the Democrats past videos on this matter.! For 40 years they on both sides have campaigned on border security and a wall.,That’s only what you and your radical base want. You are throwing a childish temper tantrum by shutting down the government. You are a disgrace to this country!

Silvia Serra Lobo He has the facts illegals get benefits right away but Americans are on a waiting list . You get the facts 🇺🇸,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Lotus Saenze ~  You're also a part of the problem.  Don't speak of peace when you have facebook pages liked, that are "hate Trump" and Colin Kappernut.  Trolls are so obvious.  Oh, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, were space cadets.  Didn't like them.,Republican Congressmen and Republican Senators, all Republicans, need to forget Nancy and hound all the other democratic Congressmen and Senators.  Work on them and they'll do something about Nancy Pelosi.  Pelosi needs to be reminded of who it is she works for and that she is NOT the president....not even close.
Diane Ohlzen  BULLSHIT.,Republican Congressmen and Republican Senators, all Republicans, need to forget Nancy and hound all the other democratic Congressmen and Senators.  Work on them and they'll do something about Nancy Pelosi.  Pelosi needs to be reminded of who it is she works for and that she is NOT the president....not even close.
Diane Ohlzen Well "sweetie aka bitch" The Republicans didn't get it passed because our democrat disguised as a republican majority leader, Paul Ryan didn't do his job any better than Nancy.  They passed small amounts for the wall and thats because that was all Paul Ryan put on the floor to vote on.   As for the shut down, Trump can claim it but the fact is that it is Nancy's baby.  I can claim I anything, but it doesn't make it mine.  I'm hoping the shutdown lasts until approval for boarding funding AND THE WALL has been secured.  Democrats of today are idiots.                              CLOSE THE BOARDER AND BUILD THE WALL!                                             #MAGA,Republican Congressmen and Republican Senators, all Republicans, need to forget Nancy and hound all the other democratic Congressmen and Senators.

Will he build a wall for that,Not trying to be rude but Americans do that all the time either drinking and driving or texting and driving causes accidents
Abby Schmidt Nobody cares  any more it has become to dangerous.    between the gangs , ISSI , the illnesses a lot of which are fatal & the rapist, Drunks, & Drugs coming through the borders its time to close them.  lord forbid  one of them should kill one of your family members. then you would understand. I raised my kids on my own.  i got welfare for 6 months i took a cut in pay to get off it. it was not designed to be a way of life. Kids now get pregnant now so the Tax payers have to pay for their kids .  if you can't afford to buy insurance then don't have kids.  when they are raised on it they don't even try to get off it, we don't owe other people a living especially from other countries that is communism go to Cuba  Russia North Korea ,  they are starving ,  if your sickly, disabled or old they let you die.  your only allowed 2 kids in China & Japan.  if you get a job your paying for others medicine, housing, food, How do you want to live just getting by or have a chance to have nice things, travel give your kids nice clothes , take them out to eat. afford a safe place for them while your at work. the rich democrats who all voted for the wall before Trump won are not going to give you anything. they all have wall, gates, armed body guards. & they would have you arrested if you dared to come near them,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Eva Graham at least Pelosi has shown her Tax returns.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Angela Wilson agree so very well said,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Stan Piznarski agree,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Buck Strunk we do not have open borders,No other country has open borders why should we
Well we c u didn't Photoshop your profile pic.... Lol,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Sharon Varner I agree!,Do not cave into the Dems  If you do not fix the borders now it will never get done. This is the only way you will get reelected
I’m not looking for a scapegoat Cecilia. I’m looking for security at our borders. There’s a legal way to enter our country as opposed to the mobs that are trying to enter. Also for security against trafficking, drugs and crime that are proven to be an issue at the border.,Stay Strong against those who will destroy our country!
Frank Betty Page it's all that booze she takes in.,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP

Martha Dillon Give me a damn break, Obama, Hillary, Pelosi, and other Dems have lied to the American people over and over again.  Ask the mothers of the men that died in Benghazi.  Obama lied about the cause of their deaths.  He was a traitor to our constitution by supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, and here's a list of some other lies he told.  You are a gullible idiot. https://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/statements/byruling/false/,Eric Wroblewski thank you

The immagrants will find another way to get to this country...,But our National Security is at Risk and giving Putin our National Secrets!
Right on Kevin,How many thousand American government employee's are currently not working who's job it is to protect us ?  That is defending a nation sir and you won't let them with your shutdown...   Let me repeat that Donald Trumps Shutdown.   So with that if National Defense is your highest priority?  You fail.    Resign
We need a new President...this is absurd, with holding government employees paycheck...they must be suffering,This should read: If we don't stop the Russians then we cease to be a nation.

There had already been CORRUPTION on the Southern Border !Trump, you are complete imbecile,pay the Coast Guard ASAP, they keep our borders "SAFE" ! If this is Not some kinda of "SiCK " game and a Political ploy to "USE" your CRAZY base,then prove it ! OPEN UP THE GOVERNMENT! I still am interested in where all the 1.6 Billion Dollars that you got in March went ? Why are you asking for an additional 5.7 Billion dollars ? Why hold these Feberal workers "Hostages" just so you can say "I won " ? It should demonstrate to the American people that you don't "Care" about the citizens of this Nation and that you are a "Greedy ,INCOMPETENT,EGOTISTICAL,,LIAR "! Trump your tweet about Schumer is very PATHETIC,you Fired Comey because of the "Russia Thing"! What Trump are you grasping at straws?

Patti Cullen go south to the border and you will see. And more are on are their way. Please dont think I am against imagination ,I have many friends  that have come to America legally and are wonderful hard working people. What  is happening at the southern border is an invasion by people that have no intention to imagrate legally. That should give us reason to be concerned for our country.!! Build the wall,technology, what ever it takes to keep us safe. It is just an older lady's opinion, not looking to cause a FB backlash,We want the wall.and stop the invasion of our country!!!!!
Charlesetta Brown r u crazy one crime ? Open yoyr eyes . There is crime by the hour from these illegals. Not to mention these drugs are kids are getting from them. You people need to wake up,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Estefania Torres Restrepo you grow up,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain

Joshua Snyder  Simple Trump wanted to make the DEMOCRATS the bad Guys.,This is one thing about Trump that baffles me. I would have been getting everything I could get done about border security while my party had total control of Congress. He wouldnt have had to put up with any BS from the Democrats. I think he is hurting himself even with his own supporters over shutting down the government for so long over something that could have already been handled.

....I'm sorry you find it amusing, Dan.... Are you aware of how many millions of dollars a day the illegals are costing us...? And now - all the families in crisis because of the shutdown and our President has agreed to a compromise and Nancy Pelosi isn't open to negotiating....? I am almost ashamed to be an American...,a wall doesn't mean KEEP OUT  it simply means ' please use the door....'
my son is a father of 4 in Utah and he gets extremely discouraged at all the Mexicans there - filling their shopping carts with food that he has never been able to buy for his family, crab legs, steak, etc.... Nothing against Mexicans, you understand - just discouraged with our broken system.... I hope this helps shed some light on the reality of things ~,a wall doesn't mean KEEP OUT  it simply means ' please use the door....'
when your ancestors and my ancestors came to American ( unless you are Indian - ),a wall doesn't mean KEEP OUT  it simply means ' please use the door....'
P. S. Steel Seizure is stare decisis.,Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress up until a few days ago. How was this simply not legislated sometime over the last 2 years? Hmm. 🤔
Courtney Leigh poor anti American idiot.,You are one in million and million in one. Love you Trump ❤❤
yes exactly, the dem abortions. fucking genius response.,How many children have been killed by Americans?
Statistics show that both legal & illegal immigrants commit less crimes than native born Americans.,For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not “criminals” by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of “criminality” ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of “felonies” have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized.
Brent Robinson 100% spot on!,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Laugh until you cry!,Trump 2020!

Ruben Radar Rodriguez Amen to that!,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Shannon Malcom boohoo..Keep being brainwashed from the liberal ideology.  They have you believing everything will be for free...Nothing EVER is for free....They only want total control, power and votes.......Wake up and see the light.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Cindy Cripps-Prawak not just about a wall do you think the drugs and child trafficking is ok. Nancy don’t seem to think this country is in crisis she is off traveling.  How can you blame the shut down  100 percent on trump are you really that blind to the facts.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Sarah Knutson Please..can you think for yourself??  What has Trump done that you hate him so much?,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
We have to build the wall to find out who's paying for it.,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Charlie Daboub, Honestly no.. I'm just saying I think a good idea...,I'll vote for that man in 2020 also! BUILD THE WALL!  And anyone that doesn't like the wall or the idea of it should go live on the other side of it
Lee Grant whether he's right or not I still feel how I feel I still feel we should build the wall Democrats in anybody else that don't like it the live on the other f****** side of it not for nothing but I work my ass off to send my kid to college and now immigrants get to come here and go to college and s*** for free so let me ask the people something that don't want the Wall.. if us Americans went to their country do you think that they would honestly give us what we give them, food, housing, health Insurance, and now free college education! BULLSHIT!,I'll vote for that man in 2020 also! BUILD THE WALL!  And anyone that doesn't like the wall or the idea of it should go live on the other side of it

Angela Wilson and democrats in America are socialists.  You can tell by thise that are on this page. They are all they riot they aren’t,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Brett Beardsley from the start they have been terrified. Spot on,Both sides are afraid you'll fix things, it gives them less to fight about and less to feel 'needed'. Keep it up!
Casey Voigt go worship on Barry’s page. You’re not American so F off,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak it’s over, idiot. Keep up. Did you think it was shameful when Barry and billy did it?  You’re on welfare.  You Canadians need to stick to your own business.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Debbie Reed Duffy she’s Canadian, so she is so dumb she doesn’t know it’s done. The shutdown didn’t affect her.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Sheila Wilson Keller she’s a brainwashed liberal Canadian just filled with hate for one person    She has no idea why, she’s just on a bandwagon.   These doors get on here to start problems and spread hate.  They know nothing at all.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Chrystal Renee Van Horn she’s Canadian,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Faye Lemke Hamilton that’s because Cindy is Canadian.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Curtis Rice inbreeding 🙄,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Gary Kane calm down little guy.  That was barry,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
John Garrison they don’t want to,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
Lee Barrett that’s barry and Killary,Says the Russian agent.
Orie Franco yup. Non essential. And they will get all the pay back. So, you Democrat’s want more government control over your lives so you are more dependent on them?  You don’t even know how stupid and brainwashed you are. True to your Nazi/communist roots.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Nick Baker but it was ok when Barry did it? Question why there are so many non essential employees,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Rod Novoa dumb ass liberal. You want oppression and poverty,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jonathan Clyburn it’s reality. Democrats hate that. So weird how we haven’t heard from Isis, etc since barry left office.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...

Gary Kane I invite you for a one on one. I guarantee you will be more educated on your ignorance,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
I understand all this and not  trying to cause any arguments. But of his reasons is illegals killing Americans well there are a lot more Americans killing Americans than Illegals killing Americans just makes no sense that's all. And as Rich as he is why doesn't he pay for his wall ?,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
I'm not saying building a wall is useless just saying they will find a way to get over it or under it. Just common sense that's all.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Kathy Smith Williams depends who the next president is walls have been taken down before.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
like Putin?,Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.
Projection. As usual. Insult the Dems for the faults of your fearless leader trump.,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP

Jim Villella Democrats dish out the same insults sadly.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Amen..,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
John Decker  maybe you should read the comments,John Decker  maybe you should read the comments
Bob Roman you're a typical Leftist. Love to name call.,Build the damn wall President! This is why we elected you!
Jon Haugen , the $$$ comes from everyone.  We should have a say in how its spent.  Majority do NOT want a wall.  (And, yes, I lived in San Diego for years).  Far more effective, cost efficient ways to secure the border.,They are but it still has to be released from the treasury by law
Diane Sanchez LOL Did your California physic tell you this? Or your crystal ball? Maybe your magic eight ball? No matter which you used, you most definitely need to get more educated forms of information! Hilarious!

Ruben Radar Rodriguez ahhhhh your own profile reveals you aren't a Federal employee..... More time invested in creating this account but fake is fake....it's been reported to Facebook,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Christopher Valinski  is FLOTUS running our country or getting a paycheck ?  Or do you just have your ass hairs twisted over something that don’t matter ?   I think it’s the 2nd one  😂,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Omar Martinez  what what ?? 😂,Todd Schroeder  we don’t care about the horse face comment what we care about is you making threats to blow people up with your industrial electrician skills   It was sent FBI – Federal Bureau of Investigation

Todd Schroeder  nope because we are rational responsible people who don’t think about shooting or blowing people up .,Victoria A. Deobald how you know this
Todd Schroeder  this cunt just sent your threats off to the authorities  And you didn’t delete them fast enough before I sent those threats to BF Goodrich too 😘,Victoria A. Deobald how you know this
Todd Schroeder  we don’t care about the horse face comment what we care about is you making threats to blow people up with your industrial electrician skills   It was sent FBI – Federal Bureau of Investigation,Victoria A. Deobald how you know this

If Trump does get the wall built passed without Dems support and it does make a difference, the Dems are going to prove to everyone that they didn’t pass it because they don’t like trump. If you see the videos of them saying we need to control immigration and build barriers, then they are on stalling because Trump is keeping his promises and they don’t like a politician who keeps his promises. I don’t care who pays for it as long as it gets taken care of. I know many people who have come here the legal route.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974.

Lydia Heilman no let’s shut the government down when they want to give us healthcare that is expensive and insurance companies still deny claims.did you forget Obama shut down the government for that? Oh yeah, we have to pass the bill to see what’s in the Bill. Now how was that transparency?,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.

One of the main reasons Trump got elected was because of the wall. You really think he doesn’t have support? Do you lock your doors when you aren’t home or away from home? Do you let complete strangers come inside? Well think of America as you home.

Micheal Marceaux  too *,This a reps job to make a mess bring in the dems for a whileblame then for their inability to clear up yearsbeyond years of rep damages and get played as the puppet for the chaos so a rep can stand back in and act like a hero so fucking abusive man
We are all victims now aren't we? We have one branch of government, the executive, the potus, refusing to pay his employees, our federal workers, to force our  other co-equal branch of government, (Nancy is the lead speaker of the house of it)!  one branch can't force the other to do things! our president has shutdown our govt, created a crisis right here, right now, trying to force his demands for 5.7 in taxpayer$ for construction funding! #OpentheGovernmentNow!,My heart and prayers go out to all the victims! And if you think about it ,aren't all legal hard working Americans victims? They come here and abuse our law and order, our resources , our job opportunities, our taxes that should be used to benefit Americans who are struggling! They broke our laws and we are paying the price.  Build that wall!
He may be in a pickle?  face impeachment, or resign and face conviction! ??,A black man voting for Trump is like a virgin voting for rape.
we are a democracy! One branch of our gov't, the executive branch, the president, can't force the other!  End the Shutdown! Fight over "beautiful see through steel barriers"  later!,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
David Lindstrom   behind in your reading?,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises.

one branch of our government can not force another branch! It's at the heart of our democracy! He can not force this construction project funding! no president is all powerful! He can Open the Government and haggle construction funding later! Ya know, so his employees can get out of the food lines, he can stop racking up shutdown costs over 4.6, putting airline travel in jeopardy...,To the Democrats FUND THE WALL NOW.
Just saw what Apple said , DOH,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Kevin smith, ha so you believe in an armed revolution very gung ho of you to recommend that to the UK. Be we are not Gun mad unlike you lot who don't deal with the problem thats killing your kids,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Liz fisher, don't be sorry for him I'm from the UK and he is talking rubbish,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Ok just to educate you, and show you that danny the blue nose doesn't know what he is talking about. The uk has a budget of 18 billion gbp for the EU, we get 5 billion gbp back as an immediate rebate and another 4 billion gbp to spend on public services therefore the net contribution is about 9 billion gbp. Replied back soon enough for you twat,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Renee ladd magee you've been watching too much Fox news, there is nowhere in Europe that has sharia law. I live in a uk city which has a large ethnic community, and you it has problems but its problems driven by unemployment and low paid jobs not what race or which god someone follows. Do not the US have the same issues in its inner cities ?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
And as a UK tax payer you know that we pay a lot to the UK but we also get funding back don't we ?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
I think you'll fine Danny doesn't know what he is talking about,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
So Veronica where exactly did this happen ?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Dave really great sarcasm but I think it is lost on most of the people who would read this post, certain your not British?,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Jim Butkowsky these are the people that see anyone can carry a gun and look at the number of gun crime let alone MASS SHOOTING  !,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Gerri Modic Candelaria you're going to be paying for the wall with taxes, that doesn't in anyway imply that Mexico is paying for it.,Mike Hine there was bipartisan support to open the government, and Donald denied it because it wasn't the right number for him. You know my views about Donald more than probably anyone else Mike.

Alex Traynor the great wall of china worked pretty well for a while,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don’t support it. Don’t say we.
Nancy D Heffron You're too old to be collecting dolls and taking their pictures as if they were real.,Today is my birthday. I'd like a wall to be built please. Thanks!
Robert, first uncage the kids.,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
Danielle Moore You have your head up your butt. The uranium deal had the blessing of both Hillary and Obama and they both made money off of it.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Laurie Dunco They are taking care of the illegals with our Social Security money. Years ago in Obama's first years they even sent me a letter telling me not to worry how they would support the illegals as they were using Social Security money. It made me sick.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Jeanie Railsback ever thought your building skills are less than par.,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.

Karl Hesford cars kill people you want car control also. Thousands of babies are killed daily and you probably support that.,America is truly a fucked up place. Thousands of Americans are shot by other Americans. You do nothing about gun control but are happy to spend millions to keep a handful of criminals out rather than deal with the ones you’ve already got.
Rob Egerton right on that abortions kill thousands a day.,Far more Americans are killed each year by fellow Americans - especially with guns, but he's not bothered about them.

Dennis Banaszak not even close to time for this yet.,it does no good to tell Nancy.  Time for Americans to storm Washington and remove ALL Democrats by force.   Excersize our 2nd amendment rights.
Fred Leenhouts democrats only condone violence they themselves create to incite panic so they can continue to take away privileges that was never supposed to be able to be amended. I am of course referring to our Bill of rights that they have in fact effectively changed to a bill of privileges that they can take away at anytime without notice, cause, or due process of any kind.,YOU CANT DEAL W/THE DEMOCRATS,THE ONLY THING THEY UNDERSTAND,IS VIOLENCE,\

And democrat votes......,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Seems to work all over the world..are you on the take somehow...,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Lea Callahan you're as big of a joke as your "president",Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!

Larry Lubiner so, you didn't pay attention about the thousands of migrants coming up from south America? What you are claiming is ridiculous!,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
So sorry for your loss. These idiots who turn their heads and pretend not to hear or see what is going on because see they haven't had a loved one killed by an illegal are fooling themselves if they think they are going to remain safe if this situation isnt dealt with. I stand with our president, and I stand with all who have lost a loved one because the Democrats refuse to help support the wall.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
KEEP PRAYING TOGETHER  One Nation under God. Prayers, Praises & Faith. May God protect and guide our President! MAGA 2020,God Bless you President Trump! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸

More : Sarsour was honored as one of the “Extraordinary Brooklyn Women,” and has sparked controversy because of her closeness to Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York. The newspapers added that in the past, if you wanted to become mayor of New York, you had to campaign to get closer to the Jews and get their votes, but now in a clear shift, you need to race not only to get the support of Muslims, but the voices of those with ties to Hamas, as is the case Linda Sarsour. Sarsour has also been charged with anti-Semitism because of her public pride that she has relatives who have been convicted of belonging to the terrorist Hamas movement.  Linda’s brother, Jameel Sarsour, is accused of belonging to the terrorist group Hamas and being on the terrorist list of the United States government, under the category of a “specialized international terrorist” by the US Treasury Department. It is strange that Jamil Sarsour lives freely in the U.S. although the government has given him this terrorist label. The FBI agents who investigated him, including FBI agent Robert Wright and retired FBI agent John Vincent, are very angry about it.  Despite this, Sarsour was a familiar face in the Obama White House. The Obama administration opened the White House to adherents of political Islam; they attended hundreds of meetings at the White House. Court documents and other records have confirmed that many of these visitors belong to groups that act as fronts for the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and other Islamic organizations. These investigations were based on a comprehensive analysis of records of visitors to the White House. These meetings were conducted with groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and other groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2013, White House officials received a delegation from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, which is now banned in Egypt and many Arab states as a terror group. It seeks to impose Sharia by force. They visited the White House. And Sarsour confirmed that she was invited to at least seven White House meetings between 2010 and 2014.  Obama is gone from the White House, but Sarsour’s continuing influence on the Left is a bad omen for America, a sign of what will happen in the future.   https://www.jihadwatch.org/.../linda-sarsour-is-a-bad...jihadwatch.org,Linda Sarsour is a Bad Omen for America. This person is a liar, an enemy of the United States and Israel! It will have to be EXPULTED. We are afraid for your safety.  Jan 19, 2019 8:00 am By Rami Dabbas - 30 Comments  Every day more secrets are revealed about the Muslim Brotherhood and the State of Qatar, which stands behind the Muslim Brotherhood and supports it financially and morally through several tools and institutions, both inside Arab countries and in the West, especially in the United States of America, under the cover of the charities and NGO organizations located in those countries.  Linda Sarsour is an Arab American of Palestinian origin and executive director of the New York-based Arab American Society, an association that is administratively linked to the Qatar Foundation International and ideologically follows the Muslim Brotherhood and Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi – a terror promoter — who strongly supports the terrorist Hamas movement and the Qatari government, which is allied with adherents of political Islam. The Qatar Foundation International is closely linked to the Qatari government. Former US Treasury Department analyst Jonathan Schanzer describes the institution as “an ATM for the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliated groups, the spiritual father of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, as well as funding Hamas and terror groups in Syria.” Schanzer stressed that Qatar’s neighbors from Arab countries were “nauseated” by Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Qatar Foundation and the Emir of Qatar established the Al-Qaradawi Research Center in honor of Qaradawi. The purpose of the Center was to promote Al-Qaradawi’s ideas on the basis that he was a pioneer of moderate Islamic thought for Muslims today. In January 2012, the Qatar Foundation (QF) opened a center for Islamic legislation and advocacy. Tariq Ramadan, the grandson of the Brotherhood’s founder Hassan al-Banna and the son of Brotherhood leader Saeed Ramadan, was appointed as the director of research of the center.  At the same time, the Qatar Foundation has strong ties to the International Institute of Islamic Thought, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States that was investigated on terror finance issues after the 9/11 attacks. The deputy director of the Qatar Foundation for Islamic Legislation and Advocacy was Jasser Odeh. At the same time, he taught and lectured at the International Institute of Islamic Thought, as he mentioned in his own profile. The Muslim Brotherhood in the United States described the International Institute of Islamic Thought as one of “our organizations and institutions owned by our friends” in a secret memo issued in 1991. The memo states that the purpose of its network in the United States is “a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destructing Western civilization from within.”  Now we come back to Linda Sarsour, who also has suspicious personal relationships. In 2004, Sarsour told the press that the US authorities questioned her and her Palestinian husband Maher Judeh, who was threatened with deportation after living in the United States for seven years. In the same interview, Sarsour mentioned that one of her cousins spent 25 years in prison in Israel, and that a family friend was sentenced to 99 years in prison. She added that her unmarried brother was also serving a 12-month sentence for being a member of Hamas.  The New York Police Department opened an investigation into the relationships of the Arab-American Association, headed by Linda Sarsour, and tried to obtain information about its board members. It found that its chairman was Dr. Ahmed Jaber, head of the Dawood mosque, known as the Islamic Mission in America. Sarsour is constantly trying to portray law enforcement officials and the government as unfair to Muslims, and her claims and fears of terrorist plots are in fact government conspiracies, according to Sarsour.  For example, Sarsour said that New York police detectives fabricated terror cases so they could get funding for the New York Police Department. The government stopped an al-Qaeda plot to destroy an aircraft using an explosive device hidden in a person’s underwear: Sarsour claimed the attacker was actually a CIA agent. In an interview, Sarsour said that “fear of Islam” is merely a manifestation of American persecution of minorities, and the United States remains a democratic state with an authoritarian element. Sarsour is known to launch fierce attacks on Muslim Brotherhood opponents, including Muslim dissidents themselves, so the Qatar-affiliated Brotherhood put its money in the right place when it decided to invest in her organization.

Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Maybe you tell that to members of congress, they won't negotiate...,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Cindy Sak Nowak go live in Chicago or Mexico if  you really believe gun control works .,I'm so sorry for your loss however more kids get killed in this country by American citizens. The immigrants aren't the problem, the guns are.

Karl Hesford go to Chicago if you want the safty of gun control  !,America is truly a fucked up place. Thousands of Americans are shot by other Americans. You do nothing about gun control but are happy to spend millions to keep a handful of criminals out rather than deal with the ones you’ve already got.
Martin Miranda no the wall at the prison or mental facility will hold them     walls work,Tell me about all the Americans that have performed massive killings, mass murders. Then they just say they have mental problems. I bet we have to build a wall around their houses as well.

She and 30 of her democrat coworkers along with 100+ lobbyists were having a lovely time in Puerto Rican enjoying that balmy weather, attending the play Hamilton and partying with the cast in the evening, while regular Americans are struggling to make ends meet since giving 0.005% of the $3.8 trillion annual budget for the wall is just to expensive!

Arturo Elroy Mañana mhttp://dlvr.it/Qx3hxn,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.

Laurence Hyatt Thank you 😊 very much!,This is a great message bc President Trump comes across to me, as caring, he’s polite and personable. This Angel Mom confirmed what I see. If I was in Pelosi chair, I’d set those ppl right in a hurry. She’s laying low, as they say. If this was Healthcare I’d be on the other side. js... I think we have to look 👀 at this with fresh eyes 👀, open heart’s and mind’s. You have to do a deal, pass legislation, be present. You can’t deny a meeting when it’s your job. A woman who knows her power and uses it in the best interest of the situation, that’s a powerful woman who cannot be bought. Who is Nancy Pelosi ? As a person, I do not know??? She’s hiding.
Elisa Farina DiCarlo “What’s going on here” is that we have a sitting President who actually CARES about OUR country. I don’t know who you are or where you came from, but if you don’t like the upturns we have had, then you are more than welcome and free to leave. I’m sick to death of liberal BS, and those who “think” they are the future of the USA. This mentality is what is killing it to begin with. Just go.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Susan Stalla Sure he would if he did followed the proper immigration procedures. #justcantbustin,Eric Wroblewski thank you

High approval rating. Just writing that makes everything that follows crumble.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
I’m pretty sure Dave was being sarcastic, but then I didn’t believe that was a real picture of the omelette station either.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

I'm sorry you still believe in a man proven to be immoral (not just adultery but scamming workers from their pay and much more), rude, disrespectful to our men and women in service and veterans; a man with the demeanor of an angry spoiled child who happily watches people having to go to food banks, some even putting their homes up for sale, because this man, this one you still believe in, will not accept what has ALREADY been offered in a bipartisan offering to add to the billion he hasn't spent yet on border security. This is a TEMPER TANTRUM! Do you have children? Would you let all the other children suffer because of the actions of one? And yet you believe in him still. That brings into question either your own morality or your intelligence, not something I can know. But you do. and also? He's just not a smart person.

Don, apparently you are still going to work every day or earning some kind of money to keep a roof over your head and food on your table. And you have the compassion of your President. That would be none.,Thank you President Trump! I admire you for holding your ground and keeping your promises.
Amy, I’ve been there. And I would like to come back. How are you helping? And, by the way, this wasn’t about El Paso, itwas about Trump once again making incredibly ignorant statements.,Ryan, because he didn't?

Steve Tyree Revisionist history much? PLEASE don't tout your education when you spew such a ridiculous spin on why it was close to impossible for President Obama to get his agenda accomplished.

There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.

Carl Ostendarp STFU -- obama went golfing 8min. after one of our journalists was beheaded .https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/us/politics/a-terrorist-horror-then-golf-incongruity-fuels-obama-critics.html,I am so sorry for your loss but your daughter was killed by a drunk driver.Who,What,Where,or Why they come from doesn't matter. Unfortunately, people are killed daily by drunk drivers in America and probably 99% are legal US citizens that kill them. I know this will never ease the pain of the loss of your daughter, but to blame a person on  the status of his citizenship is so very wrong.
Kris Landers How hard for you is this to understand ??? If the person was never in the country, he wouldn't have been here to cause the accident. -- Get that GED, you need it .,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Donna Davis Takes one to know one.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Charlesetta Brown Illegal entry is criminal.They can go through legal channels!,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.

Buck Strunk stupid as remark,No other country has open borders why should we
Zdenka Udovicic  what is the problem with my statement? It is a fact followed by an ironic question. Maybe your English isn’t good enough to understand the point of what I wrote?,White American men kill the most Americans every year. True fact. What keeps me safe from them?

NOT CNN THOUGH....THEY WILL TWIST THE FACTS AND WILL EVEN BLAME YOUR SON ...OR EVEN YOU!!! OUT WITH THE DEMONCRATS! OUT!!!!!! THE ARE TREASONOUS!,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL

Brandon Wright slowing down illegal immigration would help our homeless and needy immensely. Do you know how much our government programs are giving money , food stamps, free medical, etc. to illegals!? While our vets and needy citizens go without. In the state of Colorado, if you are illegal, you will pretty much instantly qualify for government assistance. It is sickening.,And if you don’t look out for your citizens?? At what point does one outweigh another. You truly can’t say you care about America when there is so many people working for the government, your government, not getting paid....I mean come on
Darlene Carter done!,Call 1800 344 8082 press 1 to Demand THE Wall
Yeah.... right. Keep watching CNN.,No one is talking about free anything 😂 I just mentioned there are immaculate flaws with all.of these and you assume it means free. Amazing.

Steven Bugden I'm only assuming you're speaking about pelosi also..at least I would hope so..don't show ignorance like others in the democratic party..,What part of "trump and his supporters" did you not understand? Was it the "trump" part, or the "his supporters" part?   Obviously you did not open the link and read the article, due to your rapid reply.  Please learn to read!
Steven Glenn I'm assuming you're speaking about pelosi and Schumer also..,Tony Perez, we've got our fair share too.

Name calling????  Big joke.  Dems are the champion name callers.,Why do the Trump cultists always call people names? Are they 5 years old?
They won't even meet with the angel parents.,Are Pelosi, Schumer others in Congress so cold hearted that they can't feel this pain of lives shattered?
So this situation is made better by allowing illegal dangerous criminals into our country???,In Chicago every 14 mins somebody is getting shot. The man who created the massacre in Las Vegas? All these shooters are "legal Americans"
Tell that to the ranchers on the border whose property and homes are invaded regularly by illegals.,trump leads through fear. Just don't buy it!!
He didn't have the votes. Republicans want the illegals for cheap labor and Democrats want them for votes and to set this country on a path to Marxist / socialism..,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Adil Shahzad Thank you!,Russians understand better than anyone what socialism and communism.Behind the attractive slogans is the tragedy of the country and every family.And our President puts his life and health to protect our beloved America from this disaster.I would have forced all Democrats to study the history of the creation and fall of the Soviet Union.If Russia had been told in 1916 that a revolution would have taken millions of lives of three generations in 1917,no one would have believed it.I pray for our President and his victory in this struggle.

Rod Novoa so you don’t believe in the best boarder security?

Wendi DelValle Umm I’m not trying to be a dick but what if it was someone else? Would you want a wall then?,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Frankie Urban  he's trying very hard, but the democraps are blocking him at every move.

Aaron Green, idiot. You don't think that trumps lawyers have not already explored all of this? LOL 😆,Bulld the wall using this Mr Trump Public Law No. 85-804, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1431-35 (Supp. IV 1998), grants to the President the authority to authorize any agency which exercises functions in connection with the national defense to enter into contracts or into amendments or modifications of contracts, and to make advance payments, without regard to other applicable legal provisions whenever such action would facilitate the national defense. 50 U.S.C. § 1431. The legislative history of the statute indicates that it may also be used as the basis for making indemnity payments under certain government contracts.

Wayne Brunner, I tuned in to CNN today and they had all the Democrats over there vying for more gun control. But the shooter had a lengthy criminal history and was not even supposed to own a firearm but he was able to purchase it. When he tried to get a concealed weapons permit that is when they did the big enough background check to find out that he was not allowed to own that firearm so the government ran by democrats there sent him a letter to have him turn it in. Apparently he didn't care what the letter said and they never did anything about it. The blood is on the hands of the the Region's government. So the government actually created this problem and now they want to step in and fix it simply by taking all rights away,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Rod Novoa DUMB@$$ Keep drinking the kool-aid... TROLL.. sissy boy,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I dont want to have to pay higher premiums because of shitheads like you.,Donald Trump you will get the wall and a lot more.  And of course, Pelosi and Schumer will take credit for it.  Obama will say he orchestrated it back when he was just a freshman chimp.  But who cares, you're getting the wall.
This chick is dumb as hell. They do have background checks. In fact you go on a 3 day waiting list. I can go down to the corner of my house in the ghetto and buy a gun off the streets with no background check and the gun won't even have a serial number on it also known as a throw away. So again remind me how gun control is gonna work??? 😂😂😂😂,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
How is building a wall to protect our citizens a violation to our constitution???,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
You mean the wall that we need because we have people coming over here illegally and breaking laws. Yeah sounds like a national security issue to me. Btw the Constitution also states to protect the American people which a wall does. Understand?,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
You show me in the Constitution where it states you can not use money to protect the US citizens,Kids in cages is a national emergency.

Norene Boone you are delusional,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Drew Mullen how many terrorists have the TSA caught vs how many of them have been arrested? 😂,Exactly! The role of government is to protect its people!
it only took place while obama was president... " he did nothing ",How many shootings are done by American citizens yet you haven't passed many come sense gun laws!
James Campbell remember when they busted them in that lie about all 17 supported that? 😂🤣,How many shootings are done by American citizens yet you haven't passed many come sense gun laws!
April Foster all these anti-trump bashing points are starting to look like overused pickup lines...   Haven't seen the money we're now getting from Mexico that we NEVER saw before in trade? " it's peanuts compared to what he is asking for the wall "   Big changes for cars. The goal of the new deal is to have more cars and truck parts made in North America. Starting in 2020, to qualify for zero tariffs, a car or truck must have 75 percent of its components manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the United States, a substantial boost from the current 62.5 percent requirement.  There’s also a new rule that a significant percentage of the work done on the car must be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour, or about three times what the typical Mexican autoworker makes. Starting in 2020, cars and trucks should have at least 30 percent of the work on the vehicle done by workers earning $16 an hour. That gradually moves up to 40 percent for cars by 2023.  While many economists think these new rules will help some North American workers, they also warn that car prices might rise and some small cars may no longer be made in North America because they would be too expensive under the new requirements. There are also concerns that automakers might not make as many cars in North America to export to China and elsewhere overseas because costs would be higher in the USMCA region than making the vehicles in Asia.  Trump’s victory: Canada opens up its milk market to U.S. farmers. Trump tweeted often about how unfair he thought it was that Canada charged such high tariffs on U.S. dairy products. Canada has a complex milk and dairy system. To ensure Canadian dairy farmers don’t go bankrupt, the Canadian government restricts how much dairy can be produced in the country and how much foreign dairy can enter to keep milk prices high. Trump didn’t like that, and dairy was a major sticking point in the negotiations.  In the end, Canada is keeping most of its complex system in place, but it is giving greater market share to U.S. dairy farmers. U.S. negotiators say they got a major victory by forcing Canada to eliminate the pricing scheme for what are known as Class 7 dairy products. That means U.S. dairy farmers can probably send a lot more milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder and infant formula to Canada (and those products are relatively easy to transport and store).  Canada’s victory: Chapter 19, allowing for a special dispute process, stays intact. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said repeatedly that he wanted to keep Chapter 19 in place, and that’s exactly what happened. The U.S. side pushed hard to eliminate this chapter, but in the end, it stayed.  Chapter 19 allows Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another’s anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court. Over the years, Canada has successfully used Chapter 19 to challenge the United States on its softwood lumber restrictions.  Mexico and Canada get assurance Trump won’t pound them with auto tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened to slap hefty tariffs on car and vehicle parts coming from overseas into the United States. Along with the new trade deal, his administration signed “side letters” allowing the two nations to mostly dodge Trump’s auto tariffs.  The side letters say Canada and Mexico can continue sending about the same vehicles and parts across the border free of charge, regardless of whether auto tariffs go into effect down the road. Only parts above that quota could face tariffs.  Trump’s steel tariffs stay in place (for now). Canada wanted Trump to stop his 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel. That didn’t happen — yet. The two countries are still discussing lifting those tariffs, but a senior White House official said Sunday that process is on a “completely separate track.” Trudeau has called the steel tariffs “insulting and unacceptable” because the two nations are such close allies.  Improved labor and environmental rights. The USMCA makes a number of significant upgrades to environmental and labor regulations, especially regarding Mexico. For example, the USMCA stipulates that Mexican trucks that cross the border into the United States must meet higher safety regulations and that Mexican workers must have more ability to organize and form unions. Some of these provisions might be difficult to enforce, but the Trump administration says it is committed to ensuring these happen — a reason U.S. labor unions and some Democrats are cheering the new rules.  Increased intellectual property protections. The new IP chapter is 63 pages and contains more-stringent protections for patents and trademarks, including for biotech, financial services and even domain names. Many business leaders and legal experts believed these updates were necessary given that the original agreement was negotiated 25 years ago.  Big drug companies gain more footing in Canada. U.S. drug companies will now be able to sell pharmaceuticals in Canada for 10 years before facing generic competition. That’s up from eight years of so-called “market protection” now.  Deal must be reviewed after 6 years. The USMCA stipulates that the three nations will review the agreement after six years. If all parties agree it’s still good, then the deal will continue for the full 16 year period (with the ability to renew after that for another 16 years). This was a compromise provision: Trump wanted ability to renegotiate the deal frequently. Ultimately, there will be a review, but it won’t happen until after Trump leaves office.  Chapter 11, giving investors a special way to fight government decisions, is (mostly) gone. Chapter 11 is eliminated entirely for Canada and mostly for Mexico, except for some key industries such as energy and telecommunications. Chapter 11 gave companies and investors a special process to resolve disputes with one of the governments in NAFTA. The idea was that if investors put a lot of money into a project and then the government changed the rules, there was a clear dispute process — outside the court system — where investors could get their problem resolved.  Critics argue that Chapter 11 was mainly used as a way for big corporations to get taxpayer money, but businesses say it was necessary to ensure they weren’t harmed by sudden changes when new governments came into power in Mexico, Canada or the United States. In the end, Chapter 11 is mostly gone, except for a few key industries, such as oil, that lobbied hard to be able to challenge the Mexican government if it changes the rules and tries to nationalize its energy sector again.

Todd Cuson   That's a different problem with a different solution. Fact is, people cross the border illegally where no wall or barrier exists. It needs to stop completely NO more.,Please  do  an  emergency  order  and  lock  the  border  down  completely.  Mexico  needs  to  feel  the  pain  for  sitting  on  their  corrupt  asses  not  stopping  it  at  their  border.
Sarah Knutson   Lol, this is hilarious coming from a brainwashed liberal Canuck.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...

No.  Leave the executive overreaches to the Obama administration.  It was wrong then, and it would be wrong now.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Brent Robinson his campaign promise was that Mexico would pay for the wall.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Barb Thornberry do you know more the the patrolmen that have their boots on the ground that say they desperately need walls.,You better worry what's coming through our airports and ports of entry

Florence Karfeld who knows best you or the border patrol that has their boots on the ground or maybe you know more than Mark Morgan who was the head of Border Patrol under Obama because he too says we need a wall.,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all

Miguel Levy , are you even American? Your profile says you live in Lisbon, Portugal and that is where you are from. If that is true. Then, piss off. You opinion matters about 2💩,Having a hard time understanding how our politicians have decided to become the representatives of illegals. Got all the time in world for some illegals and none for Americans. Hand out our money to people who materialize out of thin air practically. Stop pussyfooting around and build it. The progressives in both parties are never going to consent even tho they know it’s what we need. Time to see how much cartel money is in Congress and senate.

Timothy Norton, You are so right, ANY GOVERNMENT IS SECULAR, but let's don't forget THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD;  I love how king David says in Psalms 103:19 "The Lord has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all."  Also the word says in Daniel 2:21 "He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning."  Have a blessed day ❤,Mr. PRESIDENT,  You are not alone, You do what GOD sent you to do, and "WE THE PEOPLE" are 100% with you since day 1,   we will obey what God sent us to do in his word ( 1 Timothy 2:1-2) to pray at all the time for those in power , you, and your administration, and all those in authority, pray   for wisdom, protection and strength. You will overcome in the name of Jesus, if we understand what 2 Chronicles 7:14 says " if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."  WE THE PEOPLE WILL SEE THE HAND OF GOD, how will destroy all this barriers ( " enemies") that are in the way in the name of Jesus . Amen 🙏 God bless you  and God bless🇺🇸 America 🇺🇸❤🇺🇸

Austin Reis Green Did you read some of these comments? Horrible how some have suffered because of this insanity.,ABSOLUTELY AND FAST.  No more unnecessary loss of life.
Except for the American people were forced to accept Obamacare which has become unaffordable and fined if they didn't obey. Thank god Trump took those fines away. The only ones holding this country hostage are the Democrats who refuse to negotiate out of hate. Get your facts straight.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Sharon, you can always seek help from Community services, Food banks, etc.,Mary Hillgrove thank you.    have a good day
Wendy Winett Costello what tamper.  The wall?    Nah hes doing for the American people,Eric Wroblewski thank you

Why didn't trump propose this border wall at anytime duri g the first 2 years of his presidency  when the Republicans controlled both House and Senate? 🤔,No other country has open borders why should we
I totally agree Janine!,It's not just about drugs and murders. It's about the fact people are coming in illegally. What is so hard to grasp about the word "ILLEGAL?"
Danny Jones absolutely 👍🏻,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
John Jacob 💯💯💯👍🏻,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels’ hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy’s and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
Pam Tigert Me too,We need more posts like this.  News only reports about not wanting the wall. Never about the American people wanting it. That's why trump was voted in.  I am sure if it was one of those loud mouth reporters on television that lost a loved one they would be singing a different tune.   Or the Democrats in office.  I was a Democrat,switched over to Republican when trump was  running.
Heather Stevens the shithole trump created at present,No we just want YOU  on the other side of the border. Permanently. Go live with your boyfriend Vlad.
Heather Stevens why dont you?,No we just want YOU  on the other side of the border. Permanently. Go live with your boyfriend Vlad.

John Sindall or they would have committed “suicide”,What would Hillary Clinton do today about the caravan invasions if she was president?  Nothing.
Exactly. If someone she cared about was killed by an illegal she’d fight like hell for those people. Well, maybe not even then because Trump supports them. She can’t very well support something that the man she thinks she will impeach supports.,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!

Oh yeah?  Where?  Where is the proof of this?  Stop eating the garbage that is mainstream media, you hack.,Wish you'd spend as much time defending us as you do Russia.
Oh, I'm sure that's proof of everyrhing you claim.  Hahahahahhahaha.  What a joke.   I'm positive, after two years being investigated by a partisan group of lawyers, they're just not reporting this collusion or defense of Russia to the nation.  Your side claims Donald Trump is dumb, but he somehow masterminded a betrayal of that size and scope.  Which is it?  Trump is a super genius...or he's dumb and every one of the professionals investigating him is incompetent?,Wish you'd spend as much time defending us as you do Russia.
I mean.. in what metric do you mean failing?  Greatest job numbers ever, largest stock market numbers... ever, lowest unemployment, low gas prices, The Korea peninsula talking?  I mean.. What is the failure you're referring to?  You don't like the guy, that's fine, but the results are quite measurable.,It's incredible to see someone fail so miserably...

Blaine Tundler   You will be waiting quite a while. No one is against border security. Absolutely no one. The only debate is how most effectively and cost-effectively to do it. I know my math is a little rough, but I understand this wall will cost about $30 billion. A virtual wall can be created for around 1 billion. He’s been offered 1.6 billion already to upgrade and repair existing structure. The $27.4 billion difference could pay an additional 4750 border patrol agents for 100 years. In my book, that’s a hell of a lot better idea than borrowing another $30 billion from China and paying interest on it.,No other country has open borders why should we
Keith Webber Jr.  Actually, anyone that is here because they have overstayed their visa Is Trumps fault. Remember, he said he was going to round every illegal up and report them.,No other country has open borders why should we
Buck Strunk   The constant state of fear you people live in is preposterous.  What exactly is it that drives this incredible paranoia you have?,No other country has open borders why should we
Exactly the declaration I’d expect from you! No different than any other leftest so There’s no such thing as God, right? Exactly what we can expect from you & millions like you. God is still in control! How do you think you got your King? He’s your president so now down to him.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Greg Pyles we’ll even help him to the border, liberal jerk he is.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
You liberals don’t listen to anyone who levels with you. All the border patrol including authorities from Obama Bin Laden’s administration are on Tucker, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham EVERY NIGHT telling you a wall is what they need; that in fact they can do their job if they had a wall. Further that you ignore the facts and listen to your socialists congress tells me you don’t want border security under ANY circumstances.  It suits you just fine that taxpayers are spending over a $billion dollars a year on these assholes.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Fitz Ray damn right.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Larry Mitchell Oh you mean like JFK did? Like Slick Willie Clinton did? And moreover that they did it while IN-OFFICE even did it in the OVAL-OFFICE?  So your standards apply to this president but none of the Liberal bastards that came before him? You people need a damn keeper!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Roy Meston what are you willing to bet on that he’s gone next year?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Sebastian Rodriguez who’s really ruining the economy? Hmmm? You want this president to give in to a bunch so they can do this again & again!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Mike J Knifong keep singing that song!  This president stayed in Washington over the holidays while his family was in Florida simply because of the shutdown. Where were your liberals? On a beach in Hawaii, Puerto Rico while federal workers in the hundreds of thousands didn’t get their check.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another

David George, if I’m wrong, then we could save a ton of cash by restructuring all of the prisons in our Criminal Justice System to nothing but fences. And with that money we save, we could build more and more walls...You are brilliant, sir.,Matthew Cloward ya I guess prison wall are just for looks  … ya right

As always somebody with a strange last name has something dumb to say against trump ..,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Trump 2020,Common sense says build a wall for the USA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Shumer needs to go simple as that... 👍

Statewide, 61 percent of Texans oppose building a wall, while 35 percent support it and 4 percent don’t know or declined to answer, according to a poll conducted in April by Texas Lyceum, a nonprofit leadership organization. Residents of the Lone Star State who live, work and play along the international boundary with Mexico say they are happy that the Trump administration’s plans to quickly build the wall have encountered complications in Washington. A dispute over whether to fund the wall nearly led to a federal government shutdown in March, until the president agreed to delay the plan possibly until September. On Tuesday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney unveiled a 2018 budget that includes $2.6 billion for stepped-up border security, including $1.6 billion for a wall.

Brent Robinson He doesn't have a high approval rating.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Karen Ann Bradshaw aren't taxes withheld from gross pay?,I want the border secure.  I live in Texas and I can’t tell you several times  I hired someone with a Social Security number that turned  out to be fake when I filed it with Social Security. I never knowingly hired anyone who was illegal. That means that I paid someone $20 an hour for 40 hours a week and they did not pay any income taxes because they lied.   If you’re an illegal alien you cannot pay income tax because you do not have a Social Security number. Think about that Americans.
Jim Villella then why does anyone build a wall? It's to keep out what you don't want in...and as far as name calling, I don't do that but there is someone in this feed that called me a name. As far as immigrants go, sure I'll welcome them in my neighborhood too if they went through the LEGAL process to be here. Trump is no politician, I'll give you that, but he loves this Country and I like what he's done so far...so we agree to disagree.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(

Educate yourself before you post comments.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Babi Nikki The reason black  people were brought here was black Muslims who captured and sold them to Dutch and Portuguese slave traders and brought them here to be sold to the American slave market. If you want to know where the origins are of your slave people look to your own black Muslims.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans.

Are you stupid?  You're definitely confused; You confused  Obama and transgender wife Michael with President Trump and First Lady Melanie. You really should stop smoking that pipe, come back to reality, start drinking coffee. Wake up. Find God and support the truth not like Obama the father of all lies. Keep in mind(,if you have one, or can find it) that Trump is not a politician, and is the main reason Trump is President. Politicians lie honey Trump has proven himself to be a man of his word. BTW take those CNN blinders off and be apart of the solution not another liberal liar supporter of Globalization.

Oscar Olszewski didn’t vote for either. Had an acquaintance who went to a farenthold event and was shocked at his level of “partying”. And McQueen was in and out very quickly and abruptly and during Hurricane Harvey no less. No respect for either. What I realized was that politicians are useless. No matter what their affiliation. Some do good, some do bad and some are really bad. So we are forced to accept levels of “acceptable corruption”. At least that’s what I’ve found down here.,Patti Vargas I have both, but thank you for your concern. In addition to those, I have beliefs, morals and resolve. But thanks again.
Oscar Olszewski in addition to that, this city is run on favors and promises. They keep raising our taxes, say they’ll fix things then they never do. The city infrastructure itself is crumbling. Streets are awful, crime is up, they want to cut fire and police pay. Meanwhile....our taxes keep getting increased with no results. It’s nuts down here.,Patti Vargas I have both, but thank you for your concern. In addition to those, I have beliefs, morals and resolve. But thanks again.

Apple Rivera I’m sorry this happened to you but someone’s legal status doesn’t make a lick of difference when it comes to their character. This could’ve easily been an American citizen. I’m sure there are thousands of stories like yours that involved people who have legal status.,July 16, 2018: I was rear ended by an illegal, “Daniel Zuniga” who was driving an Enterprise moving truck, injured my back, neck, and shoulder. Enterprise didn’t take responsibility because they said they didn’t contract with him. Daniel Zuniga is no longer able to be found.

Charles Sneckenberg it’s so much about political parties and not about coming to an agreement.

Norene Boone perhaps after reading your long winded version of so called “due process” maybe you could get your head out of that dark space and figure out that OBVIOUSLY IT NEEDS TO BE REVAMPED,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  he offered them a deal. The ball is in the democrats court now. Blame it on the democrats.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited

If that is what you  believe Victor decinti,Thank you MaryAnn for sharing your thoughts and encouraging others ❤❤❤❤Prayers for you and  for all the victims families ..agree so important to keep fighting .. Stay strong!
I think it makes it so hard for victims of any kind to not be heard or feel as if they are shut out and refused options then being forced to keep living a negative experience to a certain degree..def prolongs the healing process.. I think the wall is a good idea to protect us and put limitations to  Such severe ongoing issues regarding various trafficking matters and also helping with getting other things in order with any other system in place that offers opportunity and financial benefit for people who do come and live here legally.. We also have to consider there are also victims on the other side of that wall and need to play a role in helping control those issues as well because not everyone trying to come here has Ill intentions and are just trying to seek safety just the same .. Such a huge issue and hard to find the right approach to help resolve all matters,Thank you MaryAnn for sharing your thoughts and encouraging others ❤❤❤❤Prayers for you and  for all the victims families ..agree so important to keep fighting .. Stay strong!

Now they have a great excuse Not to, Don’t have the votes anymore.  They are playing us.
Brandon Detwiler agreed,I think mr president should just penalize and fine everyone who doesnt want the wall… u know just  like Obama did to everyone who didnt want that worthless obamacare
Actually, it isn't. They've repaired a little existing wall, but no new wall has been started. Do a little research. Also, spellcheck is a thing now.,Melissa Lamphere you're triggered and brainwashed the wall is being built and it's beutiful. MAGA
Ps these shootings are from white American males. Let's put a wall around your butt,Hmmm. I know that is sad but there are more family members who lost loved ones inmass shootings by white American males.

Missy Turner if the government doesn't reopen by the end of the month Trump has just said on the news that we're losing ALL government programs.  Call your local Social Security office.

Hopefully, your great President will protect native American sincerely now unlike scolding Elizabeth Warren!,American arms and armed forces kills families in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and probably Venezuela and Iran too. So all those mentioned countries will allied either China or Russia to protect their beloved families.
Gary Kane I’m sick and tired seeing discrimination against the wrong people, so many poor Americans, while there’s a civil war going on to let more poor come in.  If you have clue about fiscal responsibility you would ask your self- we owe China so much from borrowing - when are they going to foreclose??,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Sarah Knutson Trump supporters just laugh at you out of touch liberals .. ha ha ha.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
The person who sold him the beer didn't hold a gun to his head and force him to drink too much. The car dealer didn't force him at gunpoint to drive drunk. It's simply called TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS!! No one forced them to kill these people - they did this by themselves. So, before you shoot your mouth off, be sure your brain is loaded!! Call us when you get some common sense. What an idiot. Ain't got the brains God gave an ant!!,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Chris Mallory   Not quite zero.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....

Ralph Alvord Hey,While these are heartbreaking stories the fact that the driver was in the country illegally has nothing to do with the traffic accident, the driver ran a red light because he was drunk

James Macleod you have the right to disagree and speak your but not to go against our laws and constitution so stick it,Pay no attention to the negative comments from the false Americans they are democrats or foreigners who went back on their alegence to America
That statistic is for LEGAL immigrants, my wife being one  100 US citizens are the victims of violent crime at the hands of illegals every day  If one of your loved ones was a victim, perhaps you would reconsider your position,Crime rates are higher for Americans than for immigrants. Fix gun control.
100 US citizens are the victims of violent crime at the hands of illegals every day  If one of your loved ones was a victim, perhaps you would reconsider your position,An America killed my best friend where should we build a wall to keep out?
100 US citizens are the victims of violent crime at the hands of illegals every day  If one of your loved ones was a victim, perhaps you would reconsider your position,We have criminals on the daily that are citizens including every shooter lately who happens to be a white nazi supremacist that also happens to be extreme supporters of Trump but every once in a while an immigrant commits a crime, big or small, and that's all that matters. Not the REAL crime problem of actual citizens. By no means am I supporting a killer but using it as a political boost is ridiculous.
MAG-GOT,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Sorry, I was wrong Bob. The latest average of all polls shows Trump T 40.0%. The 41.1% is about 3 days old. That is how fast Trump’s approval rating is falling. I should have waited till Monday to say the numbers were below 40%, they are AT exactly 40% today.  Good to see you are supporting a 41% Presidential rating. Most of his followers insist he has a 50-60% positive rating. Hope you continue to support Trump when he falls below 35% favorable.,I was at the game. I swear that Bundy was short of the goal line on that last TD. They should have had instant replay back then. Bundy would not be the legend he is today if there had been instant replay to show he did not score the winning touchdown in the final seconds.
Stan Piznarski Trump has pissed both sides off with his latest proposals. The right hate the fact he is talking about amnesty for the Dreamers. The left say it’s a nonstarter with Trump holding the government workers hostage.   His approval rating is now under 40%, a death sign for all Republican office holders. Not a good time to have a last name ending in Trump or being part of the Trump led cult.   The Trump bandwagon broke down many miles ago. It is sitting on the side of the road with broken wheels and flies buzzing all around. The buzzards are circling overhead, they are attracted by the smell political rot.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
I was at the game. I swear that Bundy was short of the goal line on that last TD. They should have had instant replay back then. Bundy would not be the legend he is today if there had been instant replay to show he did not score the winning touchdown in the final seconds.,Don't let this distract you from the the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, "Spare Tire" Dixon.
Mark Butler:  I know but, it sure would make them wise up and do the right thing for the American people as a whole and think of our country rather than their own self interests of just not letting Trump win because they despise him so much.  Over 327 million human lives versus 1 that is hated.  Odds should be in the majority's favor. wouldn't your think?🤔,So far Mr. President, the best idea yet is to freeze the pay of Congress, especially the House.  Pretty sure they will come around and do the "right" thing then...…...🤔

True but the point is we have more then enough criminals that were born here without importing other countries trash.,more people died in the Vegas massacre then all this angel victims put together..let's see why dont we start a group for people who were killed from hunting accidents..people killed in church massacres from a crazy gunman..why give these people special recognition. especially since trump has been using them as his poster women for the wall
You can try and vote him out in 2020 if you so badly want to remove him.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jason Mills walls and fencing works! Ask Nancy & Chuck. They have them around their palaces to keep people like you out!,No other country has open borders why should we
Stephen DeVoy yea look at Europe right now. They are being raped pillaged and burned and the police do nothing. Open borders must be working. Not!   Right now common people are rejecting this idea. Common folks have donned yellow vest in France and fighting to take back France. So there’s hope folks!,No other country has open borders why should we
Daniel Mckinnon so you want open borders and no country? That’s stupid!,Stand firm Democrats, don't give in to this POS President who throws temper tantrums like a 5 year old who soils his depends diaper. Make him cry.. His WH is made of glass and will soon shatter..
Gwen Fiebelkorn keep your friends close and enemies closer! Most people in Government and power are Globalist Traitors. Now he’s weeding them out. Just look even forced out the head of the world bank.,Remember Obamacare repeal? Republican House and Senate, Republican president, and Donald whiffed, twice. As I said, the Democrats are not the reason he constantly fails.
Natalie Halem yea Nancy and the Democrats won’t open the government. 5.7 billion is a drop in the bucket for them! They rather give it to Central American dictators than use it at home.,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage

Suiter Kaye ask the Democrats that run Flint why? Also know this if the Democrats cannot clean up the water in Flint just think what they will do to the rest of America if they take over.,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that’s where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don’t see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That’s unacceptable.  Anyway, I’m done discussing it.  If 🇷🇺 doesn’t interfere,  😉 I’m sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
Tif Duff if America isn’t great as we think why aren’t you and everyone else leaving? We would have most of Mexico and Central America trying to get in. Please!,No one is talking about free anything 😂 I just mentioned there are immaculate flaws with all.of these and you assume it means free. Amazing.
Tif Duff problem now days is most people take the easy way out. If they weren’t we wouldn’t have 2-5 thousand people coming up from Central America wanting free stuff.   Lucky the French people figured it out and are currently trying to take back their country and fix it with their yellow vest movement.,No one is talking about free anything 😂 I just mentioned there are immaculate flaws with all.of these and you assume it means free. Amazing.
John Decker pretty good never trusted people anyway.  Soooo?,Keep it up, Mr. President.  We are with you.  Law & Order, sovereignty
Bill, Mr. trump is compromised and has proven himself to be an asset of The Russian Federation. Remember when Mr. trump advocated on behalf of Russia at The G7 in Canada? “Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting? And I would recommend and it’s up to them, but Russia should be in the meeting and should be a part of it.” former NBC celebrity game show host Mr. trump - 06/08/18 Why is this not a bigger story? That is not normal! Why not Brazil? Brazil’s economy is far larger than Russia’s. Russia is no longer a part of The G7 because it invaded its neighbor Ukraine in 2014! This is not a drill! This is serious stuff! Mr. trump is a national security risk. I’m correct on this matter. 🇺🇸,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!

I swear for the ones that don't want this country to be better secured & wants to allow it to get worse why don't u go live with them in Mexico if you like that kind of life so much.   And for the idiots that keep sayin the wall isn't gona keep them out blah blah blah. We know it won't keep them all out but we need something to slow them down where they can be stopped. It takes a lot of man power to guard & stop them when there's so much of the border that's absolutely nothing there. It would be like locking the doors on your house. It'll keep more from breaking in so easy but won't stop them all. But you leave your house everyday with your doors unlocked & see how many times your house is invaded.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Bill Briggs so violate the constitution and declare a police state? You’re a moron.,Please  do  an  emergency  order  and  lock  the  border  down  completely.  Mexico  needs  to  feel  the  pain  for  sitting  on  their  corrupt  asses  not  stopping  it  at  their  border.

Ruben Radar Rodriguez is another lying Trump supporter.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Ryan Heather Sarah Eller Iran’s impounded funds. You’re an idiot.,Sue Howie stay in New Zealand and stay out of American politics funny how foriegners want a say in our President fu

Chris Hanson he didn't use the nuclear option.  (To prevent democrats from using it as well.)  60%.  Never had it.  Nice play on words, though.  Perhaps you should read up on how things actually work.,Didn’t you have 2 years to do this when republicans held all levels of government ?
Sorry, an illegal immigrant. Otherwise, the entire situation is the same.,We have criminals on the daily that are citizens including every shooter lately who happens to be a white nazi supremacist that also happens to be extreme supporters of Trump but every once in a while an immigrant commits a crime, big or small, and that's all that matters. Not the REAL crime problem of actual citizens. By no means am I supporting a killer but using it as a political boost is ridiculous.

Democrats had funding for border security in every version of a bill they have tried to pass.  You, Mr. Trump, are the one who is keeping the government shut down, not the Democrats.  You said you would sign the bill that was presented, the bill that would have kept the government open.  Who is not fulfilling their promises??  YOU!!  And because you can't keep your word, 800,000 citizens are not getting paid, have to worry how they will feed their families and pay their bills, and some are being forced to work without pay.  We want border security, not some ugly wall that will keep us in like the Soviets did to their citizens.  Open the government!!

There was already a deal. donnie didn't want it,  because it didn't give him the $5B that he needs to pay off the Russian oligarchs. Look towards the guy that owns the steel company that donnie has already chosen as his contractor.,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them. We see this in the recent drama from Buzzfeed. Absolutely amazing the reaction they had before they knew the truth and now after they know the truth. It’s a COMPLETE MELT DOWN.  WHAT A F——D up way to live!!!
Adams Aziz  i know 😂😂😂,Adams Aziz  i know 😂😂😂
Cynthia Forney  You cannot have border security without a strong physical barrier.  Do you remember 9/11?  We've gotten too complacent.  Do we need another terror attack to get you people to understand that?,We're telling you to restart the government...no one asked you to sacrifice American security just to get your way like a spoiled brat
Mark Hack And those "conversations" he had with the OTHER lunatic were just a photo-op, a handshake to appease his ego... Coz in reality he was PLAYED, BIGLY! https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/north-korea-secret-missile-site-upgrades-satellite-images,thanks for saving the country
Mark Hack Apart from THAT, it's common knowledge Hannity and Orange have a night call where they make up their daily "news" for you to gobble up... BTW they're BOTH  under several investigations... https://www.thedailybeast.com/report-trump-and-hannity-have-a-bedtime-phone-call-most-nights,thanks for saving the country

Mark Hack YES, Fox was sued for constantly spreading lies, back in 2004. Fox won because it was registered as ENTERTAINMENT so they could say whatever they wanted to without being liable.

LMFAO you aren't ACTUALLY worried about dirty money, now are you? Because if you REALLY, REALLY are, then: https://www.wired.com/story/mueller-investigation-trump-russia-complete-guide/,Having a hard time understanding how our politicians have decided to become the representatives of illegals. Got all the time in world for some illegals and none for Americans. Hand out our money to people who materialize out of thin air practically. Stop pussyfooting around and build it. The progressives in both parties are never going to consent even tho they know it’s what we need. Time to see how much cartel money is in Congress and senate.
If he uses executive order....the first time a Democrat takes office they'll knock down the wall. In the same way President Trump has already reversed EVERYTHING that b!tch obuma did.,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
On what grounds and with what evidence? Hurting your feelings is not a good enough reason.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is this Ok Facebook?,A joke to president allows N.Korea to have more warheads than ever before. A gangster to president ignores US people as long he and the family earns money through shady Russian business. The bragging president allows himself to say depressing comments about others and brag about pussy grabbing . A boastful president pays $ 130000 to silence Stormy Daniels. Christian rhetoric in the US is in total chaos . Cheating, pussy grabbing, money laundering president now leading the world's biggest real democracy / country in total chaos and conflicts. Russia, China, N.Korea, Saudi, Syria, EU, wall, what a con
Because if we have open borders then all the invaders will come and overload the systems and break down the United States. Then the globalist can move forward with the new world order.,No other country has open borders why should we
CM Garner , you do know our president is crooked, Right? You do know trump is Putin's puppet? Right? You are aware that most of the people around trump  are getting arrested for real crimes, Right? How much more do you need, and just last night Giuliani finally told the truth about Russia and trumps campaign.  So it's only a short matter of time before the rest of the truth about out criminal treasonous president comes out.,It's nice that Putin allows you to speak freely  lol
CM Garner I get it, you're a Russian bots, paid to post propaganda. You even have lovely pictures of that russian POS murder  Putin on your Facebook page.  Facebook has confirmed that all those bogus/fake  news pages about Hillary  during the election were in fact fake,  paid for by the Russians.  Drop dead you commie bastard.,It's nice that Putin allows you to speak freely  lol
Dann Hamblin not really. Because with true change comes sacrifice. And not that bs change obama preached while he uncle tomed his way through 8 years. Real change like securing this country for the people who live here making the country better for the ones who live here. People are tired of hearing about the poor poor immigrants and illegals who have it so bad. Screw them. America first. This country has spent far too long neglecting it's own to benefit paco and his 37 kids that jump the border and get the dream handed to them. I'll sacrifice a few write offs to see this country made better for the ones who have been here and contribute to it. Than have those write off I worked hard for handed to Jose and his family.,I love when he posts stuff. Because then all the dumbocrats come running to say how hes a liar and stupid and blah blah blah. But what they should do is actually look through the comments and look at the likes and see what it really shows. It shows that trump will enjoy another 4 years because they are vastly outnumbered. And the reason they should look at that and accept the reality coming their way is so they can just do the world a favor now and remove themselves from it immediately.
Nancy Edgeworth you mean like hiliary and her husband did? Saying things like that only proves how stupid you really are if you believe it.,I love when he posts stuff.

Buck Strunk do you seriously think that every other country in the world has walls around it except for the United States? 🙄,No other country has open borders why should we
Geoffrey Hostens so you wouldn't feel the same if she was ugly? Shame on you!,She is so beautiful! Why why why ?
Kim Miller you're right they would laugh at us if we close the border, because they already have all our big companies there. We lost thousands of jobs to Mexico so let's give the rest of them to Mexico too.,Thomas Morton close the boarder and they will pay. Good thing I ain't president you folks would love me lol.
Thomas Morton close the boarder and they will pay. Good thing I ain't president you folks would love me lol.,Thomas Morton close the boarder and they will pay. Good thing I ain't president you folks would love me lol.
Chris Davey  exactly right .,Have the democratic puts forward a rational explanation as to why the do not want a secure boarder?. Or for that matter any explanation at all?
Micheal Marceaux no you're stupidity is,How many sons and daughters has trump killed
Bull O'Neill HHS officials acknowledged that federal officials lost track of almost 1,500 migrant children in 2017 after they were placed with adult sponsors.,How many sons and daughters has trump killed
Bull O'Neill you mean one of the 1,500 children that are missing or the aborted babies his affairs have spawned?,How many sons and daughters has trump killed
Jeri Hendren yes lol they have about 10 better ideas than a wall. Read up.,So has the democrats even suggested anything on what can actually be done to HELP security on  the borders. For some reason haven't heard anything on that
Sophie Tkacz Wildrick name one thing he's done that's helped this country and tell me how it's actually helped this country.,Dude. Dumbest quote ever. How is this joker in charge of the free world???
,What about the far larger amount of legals killing legals? I can go to a bar on any given night and witness a bunch of people driving off over the legal limit. Beyond drunk driving, legal citizens of the U.S. are far more likely to commit crimes statistically. What are we doing for the far lager amount of people hurt by legals?
,Affffff he still playing this game and the trump-zombies are ‘oh yeahhh’... Jesus, year by year guns are killing innocent pple and Americans (not only in North America but in the whole north, centre and south... all sent from U.S.A.) more pple are dying from guns from America than casual accidents where unfortunately people had their faith to cross with, which involves anyone that comes from other countries trying a better life in U.S. - but yeah let’s talk about people from other countries coming over U.S. because that sounds legit instead of the real problems you guys are facing ... are you guys drinking the kool-aid or what ?! (Everyone remembers how the kool-aid pple died right??!) stop being fool ! He is the only one killing Americans and everyone elses while making profits on the top of it! ... and Trump-zombies are applauding believing every kind of nonsense - what a clueless nation!
,So, parading victims’ families? Looking for ratings, right?   An illegal made your bed thousands of times and you were fine with that bexause you and your ilk saved $$ in wages. So GTFOH with your parade, #hypocrite.
Estefania Torres Restrepo not if we get enough ice agents to round them up and throw them the hell out of here,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
What is disgusting is that You can't accept the truth more reality,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
And that's why the Democrats oppose the wall. It's apparent that they are getting kickbacks from the Mexican cartel. Just like the last Mexican president was getting. Most likely what Chapo said is true the Pelosi and the Democrats are on the payroll,There are Five groups that oppose a wall/barrier and increasing border security: 1) Those that smuggle people into the US. 2) Those that smuggle drugs into the US 3) Those that smuggle guns into the US 4) The Blue fascist rats. 5) Brainless zombies who believe anything the Blue fascist rats tell them….
So go over there and do what you say you want to do. Nobody's stopping you,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels’ hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy’s and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.

Javoris JV Dubose I have to disagree with you I'm not sure what you're doing wrong is everybody in New York is getting a higher refund and last year. So you better find a new accountant even with New York high tax rate we are winning. Maybe you don't pay taxes I don't know why you post this,Young woman from NY was just murdered by an 🚫 illegal her body put in a suitcase and dumped on the side of a road in Connecticut. BUILD THE WALL

David Owens Jeffcoat typical reply by Trump lover— always insulting,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.
You cried that Obama was going to deploy the military and enforce good rules on everyone. Trump literally does exactly that and crickets from you hypocritical idiots.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Liberalism is a disease!,No other country has open borders why should we
Liberalism is a disease, treated as such!,Don’t give in Mr President
Idiot stfu,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ruben Radar Rodriguez you are in a minority as more and more NOT 100% backing POtuS. 60% say no to Wall,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Pewlosi is the pockets of the Mexican drug cartels,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
It shows, he is just winging it and if it goes bad just blame the flag or this wall,
Jason Reger explain to me how you got into this country if you are not native american?,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Fay Johnson me to....praying he goes to hell,Mike Holub so sad you saying something like that
Joseph Siegel funny how no one mention this until he said it...but its not true...its not just free money....learn how this works before you run stupid crap from dumb ass trump,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
William Bieke everything you just said was wrong....learn about how that works before you listen to that idiot...go back to your coloring book,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Phuc Nguyen what the phuc are you talking about..,Please build the Wall ASAP! You’re the greatest President ever, in my opinion! You are a fine example for many future generations to come to learn from! Be grounded!

You said Mexico will pay for it. Now you shut down the government you lied.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Linda Gurtz Hildreth big deal 🤷🏼‍♂️,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Let me explain, Angel Moms are the mother's of children murdered by ILLEGALS. 100% of these children who were murdered by ILLEGALS Were murdered by ILLEGALS. And yes, more children are murdered by citizens than non citizens but that doesn't negate the fact that illegals are murdering children in the USA. If liberals really wanted to stop the no 1 cause of murder in this country they would help Americans overturn Roe V Wade.,I bet every Angel Mom would go without a paycheck in exchange for having their child back!
Jason Jindo we can have it all,Protect us from Russia.
Jason Jindo we need walls not just for Russia 🇷🇺!,Protect us from Russia.
Dave Callender maybe you should have died in that accident then you would have some ground to stand on for your argument like the other family's that have lost family to illegal alien's.  Think man they break the law when coming into our country and break the law after they are here. You go to their country's and break the law. See what happens to you.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Jimm Jenkens your right. And the founding fathers made sure we would have the right to bare arms in the future with the 2nd amendment.  That's so we can defend ourselves from those that would do us harm and the socialist government that is trying to arbitrate a coup against our duly elected government,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive.

The best way to end this shutdown is for TSA to go on a nationwide strike tomorrow morning so Congress cannot leave and millions of Americans get severely inconvenienced. Since the GOP cannot empathize with the common working person, pain is what they must experience.,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Robbie girl, you wouldn't know a communist if Lenin himself asked you out for a date.,Amen! Thank you for all you do.  Hang in there. We are counting on you.
Rick Voss Obama quickly, but not soon enough, that the Kim family is not to trusted. Trump hasn't figured that out yet. Perhaps Fox and Brietbart forgot to mention it to their audiences, but NK is continuing to build and develop missiles and nukes. All Kim has to do is to continue to send Trump love letters.,thanks for saving the country
Matthew David Martin Truly on of the best refutations of liberalism I have ever read. Short, to the point, and informative.,Thank you Mr. President. #BestPresidentInYourLifeTime
This especially pertains to DemocRATs and RINO RepubliCONs: "No man's life, liberty, or property are safe while the legislature is in session." -- Mark Twain,As long as we have Democrats in government we the people aren't safe. They want complete control that will ruin America.
Deborah Bartlett no it wasn't. The initial package included a 19th century wall with no technology being used. Geez, don't you people ever pay attention?,I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.
Keith Nance well guess what. It isn't. Trump proposed a 19th century steel wall. We need to utilize a 21st century solution that will both cost less and be better at securing the border.,I fully agree that we need border security. However, a wall is not the most effective or cost efficient way to secure the border. We need a mix of physical barriers and technology, with emphasis on the latter.
If illegal immigrants are so dangerous why does he employ them at all his Trump properties?! The man lies to your face (every single day) and you love him, that would make you a sucker... 🧐,No one but this great man could withstand the abuse and the lack of support and still accomplish the unthinkable. You’re a warrior, sir. We thank you and we love you. God is with you🙏💙. In my 74 years, no one even comes close🇺🇸
And Mexico will pay for it!!! (oh, we’re not doing that anymore?) 😏  Don’t you feel just a little stupid?,WHY is declaring a National Emergency to address a National Emergency in The United States considered wrong? There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve “emergencies” in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, "homes of the rich and famous” and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers"  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year." (* 2017, FAIR's)  This does not include cost of loss of life, property, and Democratic stability.
Horacio Daniel Hernandez to South Americans everything in the US is gold also! You can't just let people in without them following the process that's what Buck Strunk is trying to say! Immigrats are people that come to this country legally, Dems want to just let in anyone without being vetted because that's a sure vote for them!,No other country has open borders why should we
Rod Novoa sounds like something a Venezuelan would say about 20 yrs ago!,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Go kick there asses,TRUMP 2020.
Tell em sis,TRUMP 2020.
Yes everyone knows that..has nothing to do with disliking immigrants..it's the ILLEGAL one's..do the proper process and there is no issue at all,We are a nation built on immagrants. We judge and we should not do that..the bible says that very clearly.

Kristen Scarbrough it's not just one person it's millions.,You can't hate an entire race for one persons screw up, what if every race that white people did wrong forced you back to where your ancestors came from because trump got one person killed, one person.. You can't live life in anger and hate, it solve nothing and creates chaos... A wall should be built agreed , but hate is not the reason. Passion deprived from a Greek word "pascho" meaning affliction or suffer. "You ask God and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions". James 4:3
Greg Merz, my goodness, what have I said that makes you assume that?  (Caron),Caron ~ Thank you and your wife for bearing this burden for the good of our country.  May God encourage your hearts as we go forward.
Gina Mcknight, I'm so thankful for the sovereignty of God in my life and in the affairs of nations.  I am thankful to God with all my heart we were spared a presidency by HRC who has "values" which are counter to mine in countless areas.,Caron ~ Thank you and your wife for bearing this burden for the good of our country.  May God encourage your hearts as we go forward.
Greg Merz, our differences probably stem from what we read and listen to rather than some of the other things you suggested.  My sources include Kerby Anderson with Point of View Radio Talk Show, the ACLJ, the The Daily Signal, etc.  I'm aware of the positions presented by the MSM, but I don't use any of them solely as my source as I want both sides as I make decisions.  Also, the Bible is a source of knowledge and wisdom for me as well, and it's timeless and helpful to all.  (Caron),Caron ~ Thank you and your wife for bearing this burden for the good of our country.  May God encourage your hearts as we go forward.
Caron ~ Thank you and your wife for bearing this burden for the good of our country.  May God encourage your hearts as we go forward.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Kim Miller and you are the recipient  of the idiot of the day award.,Donna Rinerr, Great then tell Trump his Great Wall is only 423 miles long because that is not what he is saying.
Reworking immigration policies?  This is not different than banning guns.  Bad people will always find a way to have guns.  Reworking the immigration policies doesn’t do anything for the illegals.  Having a wall creates a funnel that limits the influx to specifically controlled areas.   Many people support affordable healthcare but what we have now isn’t affordable.  I don’t support a balanced budget.  I support a budget that has us bringing in more than goes out.  Stop sending money to undeserving countries for no reason.  Every broke person in the world doesn’t support tax cuts for the wealthy.  I don’t support them but I do recognize that certain taxes, like business income tax, must remain low so we can generate jobs and keep the jobs in this country.  We all support infrastructure spending so let’s stop spending 150B on illegals each year and build a wall for 5B so we can save 100B.  We then can use that money for infrastructure.,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Carol Zuback Alexander ,trump wants to grab you by the pussy. Well, maybe not you,I DO BELIEVE YOU ARE A FRAUD...TROLL   But I see you are a New Yorker,,,so I guess that's why you're so deranged...poor guy.

Ryan Clunes looks like the brainwashing has worked rather well......,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Nicole Jarrett  ... They will all get their back pay in full as soon as the Wall is funded. Even if they didn't work a day during the shut down. Neither will they be charged vacation or sick days. It always happens this way. Shut up and take the win. Funny ... did you complain when obama and Clinton shut it down for 16 and 21 days respectively? ... ** crickets ** ... thought so.,American's want their f*cking paychecks, Mr. President!
Larry Boydston who is talking about CNN? These are polls by Quinnipiac and Harvard CAPS,Polls say building that wall is not that important to Americas
Nah democrats want to ban guns already..Liberalism is really a mental disease.,سوف يقع الجدار في النار
Becky Lao they all ready have.,Americans overwhelmingly know you’re a fake
Dennis Coughlan I don't get it, if I want to keep you out of my yard and I build a big ass wall with Barb wire on top with cameras , with sensors on the ground, your saying it won't stop you? It will stop   95% of it for sure,How are democrats stopping you from building a wall you said Mexico would pay for? Is it because you lied and are now trying to stick American tax payers with the $25 billion dollar wall. Your stupid wall idea only covers a small percentage of the country and does absolutely nothing to stop the 40% of immigrants that fly in. Your $25 billion dollar wall will do nothing to stop illegal immigration. Why dont you just be honest and admit you know how to embezel and extort a ton of money from this wall project.
You must not have seen the videos of the fat woman with children walking across the very high 4' off the ground piece of wire and walking right in. Clueless,How are democrats stopping you from building a wall you said Mexico would pay for? Is it because you lied and are now trying to stick American tax payers with the $25 billion dollar wall.

Drey Claude This is not a Trump issue. You must be 2 year's old. It's been a big issues since. President Reagan. Bush Clinton bush Obama all recognized it. Finally someone wants to fix it,Day 719 of 1462 (Illegitimate Presidency) - Jesus Weeps! Mike Pence, a “man” who states he is a devoted follower of Jesus Christ LIES to his fellow Americans concerning Southern Border & defends the LIES of Donald J Trump. HE IS NOT A MAN OF GOD!   https://www.google.com/amp/s/thinkprogress.org/pence-defends-trumps-lie-presidents-dont-support-border-wall-f71c1ad56e10/amp/Pence was asked about Trump’s blatant border wall lie during interview.

Joy Sudler Really ? They are citizens? We will always have crime, but why import it?,More terrorists cross the northern border than the southern. Why no border wall in the north? https://globalnews.ca/news/4824976/us-mexico-border-terrorists-canada/Reality check: More terror suspects have entered the U.S. from Canada than from Mexicoglobalnews.ca
Katie Curran I guess your not paying attention. Ford motors is now not going to build trucks or truck parts in Mexico. They are moving those jobs to the USA. It's a multiple billion dollar deal. Yep they are paying for the wall,YOU AREN'T FULFILLING YOUR PROMISE!! YOU SAID MEXICO WOULD PAY. NOW YOU WANT AMERICAN MONEY TO PAY.  YOU ARE A LIAR!!
Mexico could have saved themselves Billions if they would have built the wall themselves.,Mexico could have saved themselves Billions if they would have built the wall themselves.
Kevin Couture yer still upset Trump Happened?  Get over it buttercup!!  MSM has, and continues, to lie to you!!  You want to see what immigration policies should be like...try crossing into Mexico illegally, or for that matter...all the things you would need to prove and provide to the Mexican government before you could move there LEGALLY!!,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
I guess it means nothing to you that when an illegal commits a murder in this country.......YES that is his focus and it should be.............,An American just murdered 5 Americans and this is his focus 🤦🏻‍♀️
Meredith Bogue They make medicine for your problem..........Preparation "H",God Bless you President Trump! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸

Timothy Coleman you are a moron. It’s you who is the pathetic follower of things against our way of life.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Lonny Watters yes we do. Politics was never suppose to be a career.,Willard Swanke i want a wall built deep and tall.
https://www.facebook.com/derekmke/videos/275714039790118/?t=21,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Harold Meinster  Trump pulled those caravans out of his ass, sucker.,So many of us are with you.  Two more caravans are coming.  Declare an emergency and get it done.  Lets the courts battle it out.
Harold Meinster  I'll bet you get trolled a lot. Its what you get when you post bullshit from a fucking cowardly, lying, draft dodger with Putins hand up his ass.,So many of us are with you.  Two more caravans are coming.  Declare an emergency and get it done.  Lets the courts battle it out.

Dave Callender this is awesome man! Godbless my brother!,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Alicia Thompson yes! We do,We need this wall!!!💯
And by his logic the native Americans are the only real Americans.,So by Donald Dumbs logic the united states never was a nation because it never had a huge wall next to Mexico. Seems legit.
Not mr. Trump Amed eeo Corey,you mean a wall?
You're delusional,you mean a wall?
Edgar D. Gutierrez the first lady was here LEGALLY and then became A LEGAL CITIZEN. What part dont you understand so that I can dumb it down to your level.,America first! Trump 2020!

David Dennison you still into those fake fisa warrants, that was done by last administration , just wow !!,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
9pm Eastern,What time is the speech tonight??
Cindy Ann Godfrey, your a special.kind of DUMB,Mitchell James lol didn’t bother looking did you
If you believe this bullcrap, then tell please tell PeterPan and the Easter bunny, hello....geez....do you have walls around your house???,Hey! You actually said something with some truth in it!!! Americans do want border security! That's what Democrats are standing up for! They want methods that are more likely to be effective than your huge wall. They are willing to continue talks about border security - which don't have to include a government shutdown. They had agreed to a funding package that included money for wall repair and some building, where applicable, but you refused to budge unless they totally capitulated to your demands for funding your wall. Way to show you care about our people - not!  Democrats are quite willing to work on improving border security. They also want legal immigration, rather than illegal immigration. But calling anyone coming to our borders "illegals" is not right. They are only "Illegals" if they try to avoid the vetting process. There is a lot of work needed to improve the immigration situation, but your stubborn insistence upon doing it only your way will get nowhere fast.
Matt Bachugan I pay taxes I dont get a refund, I'm a working American who pays for dipshits like you to get a refund you dont deserve,Ryan Wasajewski 1. A large trampoline is around 500 to 600 dollars 2. Itd make trump a criminal to not pay taxes 3. Damn son wered you get that diss almost hurt my feelings
Matt Bachugan your the most disgusting human being...why would you say something so stupid and ignorant.....you Democrats are the dipshit dumbasses of America....,Ryan Wasajewski 1. A large trampoline is around 500 to 600 dollars 2. Itd make trump a criminal to not pay taxes 3. Damn son wered you get that diss almost hurt my feelings
Why is it oue responsibility to pay you for your medical problems, cant work my back hurts,cant work hurt my neck, cant work my knees hurt, look people it is not the governments duty to provide medical and money to its citizens, it's your job as a citizen to get a job with insurance benefits,He's not ever going to change.  I'm not ever going to forgive his cowardice cutting off benefits for the people who really need it. I'm a 49 year old who has had back surgery and I'm going to have to have neck surgery soon. I can't ever hold a job cause I can't sit down or walk very much.  He's the worst president ever including all the republicans.
Kris Landers way to blame the victims. Maybe if I don’t wear a short skirt, I won’t get raped either. Nice try but it is the rapist fault for raping a 6 year little girl. Who he drugged btw,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak so it’s ok when the democrats shut the government down,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Ryan Clunes Obama held the government hostage due to Obamacare and so do Clinton shut the government down,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Sha-nee Lacey A toddler that owns 500 plus businesses. A toddler is a billionaire. Ummmm I didn’t know toddlers can make that much money and own that many businesses,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Sha-nee Lacey they can draw unemployment til the government shutdown is over and then they get back pay.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
It isn't a damned competition you myopic virtue signaling troll! Illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be here, FULL STOP!  By your logic lets let them in because we already have mass murderers?! That is really a very special kind of stupid, princess!,The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!
So it is a competition?! One is not as bad as the other?! It matters when some son-of-a-bitch guns you down?! What an asshat! What part of ILLEGAL ALIEN border jumper, who is not supposed to be here to begin with, do you not get?! As in if the illegals were not here they could not kill anyone you mental midget!,I know 500 people who were shot almost killed in Vegas.... Anything being done about that?  Your promise that Mexico will pay for it died yesterday 😂😂🤣🤣🇲🇽🇲🇽
SO it's a competition?! I s that  what your point is?! Or are you saying that crime by our own citizens justifies letting illegals border jumpers in?! "Meaningful gun reform?!" Exactly what is that?!  Most of the schools and mass shooters have obtained their weapons LEGALLY, through background checks and "common sense gun controls!" The Florida theatre shooter bought one just for the occasion the day of the shooting! Or then you have those who are criminals like the Aurora shooter of 5 who couldn't get a legal gun so guess what he did, come on Chris, guess what HE DID?! He got one ILLEGALLY!  Not one gun used in a mass shooting in this country was acquired by private sale or transfer either! The UnConstitutional Common sense gun controls we allowed last time with the promise "this will fix the problem" even knowing it would not, have failed miserably and cannot be documented as saving ONE, not ONE American life! You know what has worked, good law abiding citizens who were armed and shot back! You really are a myopic liberal lubricant! #ShallNotBeInfringed!,Mass shootings kill hundreds in America, when do we institute meaningful gun reform.
If they had barriers for 1900 plus miles of WIDE OPEN territory where illegal border jumpers can just walk in, the BP could focus more resources on those tunnels!  I have not heard of 10,000 invaders coming through a tunnel you asshat!,I hope nobody invents tunnel technology.
https://www.kvia.com/news/border/far-from-migrant-caravans-border-crossings-surge-in-texas/911604294,41 year low.....
BTW, if we secure the 1900+ miles of open territory these border jumpers can just walk through, BP could focus more resources on tunnels! I had not heard that caravans of 10,000 invaders were coming in through the tunnels or landing at the airports! You asshat!,Yeah a wall doesn't fix tunnels or airplanes must I keep going ?
If that wall saves 1 ONE, American life from being a victim of these illegal border jumpers it is worth every dime!,Yeah a wall doesn't fix tunnels or airplanes must I keep going ?
By that logic we should ONLY let in violent criminal illegal border jumpers to balance out the scales of justice?! Wow, you're really a special kind of stupid!,And a US citizen shot up Columbine, Shot up Parkland, don't get me started on Eric Robert Rudolph, or Ted Bundy. American Terrorist attack at the 96 Olympics in Atl. Yeah our prisons are filled with Americans. Whats your excuse now? Try again.

So by your logic lets import some more to be sure they have equal representation?! You really  are a special kind of stupid!,And how many Legal  (Americans) have killed the daughters of other Americans ??
As long as it isn't your family who is dead, right?! As long as it hasn't cost you personally, yet!  It isn't a competition ffs! Illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be here, FULL STOP! Between the ACA and these illegals flooding our ERs and hospitals for FREE, my 36 year old daughter is dead, how are your kiddos?!,Yes, Protect all Americans!! 5 killed yesterday from US citizen. The national emergency is gun control and affordable healthcare!! Not wasting money on a wall, Years in the courts!!

End "Gun  Free Zones" and that kind of BS will go way down!,Build walls around our High Schools, Night Clubs and Post Offices then
I refuse to argue with a myopic liberal moron, you will just drag me down and beat me with experience!  Illegal border jumper killers are everywhere, who knows maybe drunk in a car near you!,Hmmm. I know that is sad but there are more family members who lost loved ones inmass shootings by white American males.

If you threaten or defy American power and might, I encourage you to make your peace with your god and prepare for for your rewards!,American arms and armed forces kills families in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and probably Venezuela and Iran too. So all those mentioned countries will allied either China or Russia to protect their beloved families.
Emil Dörr Really, from germany?!  How is the muslim take over under your glorious merkel going?! Asshat!,1 year ago. #msdstrong  How many children die from gun violence? Declare THAT emergency.
There is no such things as "Gun Violence" or "manmade climate change", both are made up crisis! guns do 3 things, they fire, they fail and they rust, hate is in  the heart and you cannot legislate that! Finally it isn't a damned competition you witless troll, illegal border jumpers are not supposed to be her at all, FULL STOP!  By your logic because we have an epidemic of social violence brought on by liberal ideologies, we should let in more criminals?! You really are a special kind of stupid!,1 year ago. #msdstrong  How many children die from gun violence? Declare THAT emergency.
How many of your ancestors were raped, tortured and murdered by Indians before America ever came to be?! Mine were being slaughtered by them in 1622 here! Next!,How many native Americans your family killed

As in if the illegals were not here they could not kill anyone you mental midget!,Was the dude who just murdered 5 people and injured police officers in Aurora, Il an Immigrant? Or do their lives not count because an American citizen murdered them? Just curious, Because I see conservatives mock school shooting victims, but then try to claim a moral high ground when a criminal who happens to be an immigrant attacks someone.
"Hardship!"  you mean like Officer Rohnil Singh's family is facing, or the tens of thousands of families whose loved ones will never be whole again?!  Like our 36 year old daughter who died last June because of illegals?!  Is that the kind of hardship you mean?!  At least those Americans in hardship have been made whole, and I did not hear of the shutdown killing one person!  #FinishTheWallNOW! #DeportThemAll!,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.

Curtis Rice lol - these comments are great. No one can even pull a BreitBart article above crime based on demographic.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Might be the stupidest analogy I have read. Maybe confer with your elves before writing something insane the next time.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do.

Iris Nielsen no he is not, the people who oppose him and are trying to bring him down are the enemies of our country, even if they are American citizens,You took an oath to the American people- to defend our country against all threats both foreign and domestic- right now you Donald J trump are the biggest threat to our country- resign
Beverly Hurst Smith took him a while to straighten things out after 8 years of Odummer...he's the President...not a magician,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Jeremy Stephens wrong...he's letting the dimwit demolibtards know he's not going away and standing his ground for the best interest for the USA. TRUMP 2020!!,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.

Barbara leonetti please can I by your friend,Prayers for this angel family. So sorry!
Good evening,An illegal killed my dad years ago..
Hello Dave how are you,Can’t build the wall fast enough.
Please let me be your friend,Just reading through these posts proves that liberals HATE President Trump and everyone who voted for him. They spew their hateful lies and try so hard to hurt and anger. They don't get it. Most people don't live in a dark world where trolling online is their only entertainment. Pretending to be intellectually or morally superior has become the left's pathetic and desperate grab for power.
Toni Saunders how are you,Build the wall from sea to sea.
Valerie how are you doing,The reason Democrats don't want walls is because they get kickbacks from all the drug cartels... That would stop all of that
I promise  i actually  don't  care  about  politics,  i truly  think  this  guy is real  dangerous  person.  And all of his supporters  that  demand  a wall are just  sucker's,I could  spend  literally  hours  trying  to change  your  minds as a former  Bush  supporter.  But i won't  waste  my time.   Its apparent.  30 % of this country is fucking stupid
Ok man ,im not  trying  to argue  abor all of that.  . Im simply  saying  hes a douche.  You want  numbers  , i don't  have  numbers.  I am 45 and my whole life  Trump was  a dick . Now  hes president.  I can't  forget  the years  that he was a douche  . So regardless  of your  numbers  and what ever.  He was a dick  ,still is a dick  and that's  that,I could  spend  literally  hours  trying  to change  your  minds as a former  Bush  supporter.  But i won't  waste  my time.   Its apparent.  30 % of this country is fucking stupid
Im a Bush  supporter  and a Republican.....,I could  spend  literally  hours  trying  to change  your  minds as a former  Bush  supporter.  But i won't  waste  my time.   Its apparent.  30 % of this country is fucking stupid

Ali Mohammed bless and take him🙂,Ali Mohammed  Avengers return of the wall😂😂💔
Danny Jones what is your culture not trying to be rude,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Paul Johnson Mr Affluenza killed several people; he was legal, Caucasian and barely served any time.,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
Go to the freaking border for 1 day, and you will see the real threat. Just don't fly if you think it is a big threat. Wake up, you people have no idea how bad it is. But I am sure you will be the first to blame Trump when someone in your family is affected by this....,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!
Jasmine Simpson little girl you have no idea about the real world. Do a little reading, you might learn something...If we do not secure our borders, you don't have a country.,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!

Addy Means , not true, there are a few Dem Senators that are donating their pay while the shutdown continues..... I support Trump 100%,  and just like there are some Republicans that need to go, there are some good Dem's, unfortunately Pelosi and Schumer are NOT!,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Kathleen Scott, Everyone, contact your representatives and email all of Congress to support “No Government No Pay Act of 2019.” Bill , to stop congress from getting paid in a shutdown going forward. They are the ONLY ones that should not be getting paid!.,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
TJ Bell , FYI, how many seats did the GOP have...51.... how many votes to pass anything??/ 60....think you can figure out the rest!!!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

What the hell are you talking about?,No other country has open borders why should we
Denise Malloy Davis trumpturd,DEMONcrats no longer have OUR interest...just their own and it's not good for our country...they ALL need to be removed from office at this point....
You mean trumpturds I'm sure!,DEMONcrats no longer have OUR interest...just their own and it's not good for our country...they ALL need to be removed from office at this point....
He can't run from prison!!,I love when he posts stuff. Because then all the dumbocrats come running to say how hes a liar and stupid and blah blah blah. But what they should do is actually look through the comments and look at the likes and see what it really shows. It shows that trump will enjoy another 4 years because they are vastly outnumbered. And the reason they should look at that and accept the reality coming their way is so they can just do the world a favor now and remove themselves from it immediately.
Kathy A Norton wrong, the Democratic party refuses to talk so Pelosi is causing the shutdown. Trump has been waiting in Washington DC while Pelosi went to Hawaii and the Democrats went to Puerto Rico to party.   Get you facts right before speak.  Democrats want to protect illegal immigrants over the security of the American people.  DEMOCRATIC SHUTDOWN..,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Beverly Hurst Smith he never had full control.  The Senate needed 60 votes so why don't you get your facts straight and take some civics classes.  McConnell should have used the nuclear option like he did with Supreme Court justices (Harry Reid started it) and we wouldn't be where we are today. DEMOCRATIC SHUTDOWN totally.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Just as I do not understand the level of stupidity in people that think it is necessary.,I just do NOT understand they level of insanity in people that think this is not necessary
Karen Clemovich No...he's thinking about himself and the fact that knows nothing about governance, deal making, or any other quality that a good leader would have.  He is a pathetic waste of space.,Love My President, He is thinking about you and me!
Patti Cullen You confuse Trump with Obama. He thought he was above everyone and everything.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.

Brian Nixon also this is not related, but I noticed your recent post, and I agree that wildfires are a terrible issue. I'm unsure, then, why house democrats rejected a proposed bill for increased funding towards wildfire prevention methods?,We’ll gladly defend them. But we won’t pay $21 billion just to build the damn thing, plus billions per year in maintenance.   The answer is “No”.  Your popularity is dropping pretty quick. You might want to go ahead and accept defeat on this one. That’s what you get for trying to tack regulatory bills onto spending bills.  “No”. - Nancy Pelosi

Thank you for supporting #PresidentTrump while he continues the push to do what is best for #Americans, and what Americans have asked him to do. #KeepingPromises,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Kris Landers so if the “illegal” was kept out because the “illegal” doesn’t belong here, the drunk driving case involving said “illegal” wouldn’t have happened.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Nick Baker  He has been trying to open the government back up everyday and Democrats are admit they don’t want a wall. I’m not going to sound like a die hard republican because I’m far from it but I do support trump because I believe he truly loves America. If the right democrat runs you bet I’ll vote for them. I’m not trying nor will I sit here and argue. #unitedwestanddividedwefall,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again

How many kids  and people where killed by Americans how many illegals ran up in schools or churches or shopping malls compared to these Americans lol,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!

Tunde Lakatos This wall is to segregate!  Just like the Berlin wall it has been sold to people in a scare method to solve a problem that it will not address and only cause isolationism and segregation.  If you truly want to address the drug problem, you should look at our ports, airports and the border were trucks are passing inspection and flooding our country.  If you truly want to weed out the de minimus amount of truly bad immigrants look elsewhere because they aren't crossing the border illegally.  If you want to address terrorists attempting to come into this country, look at the airports and marine vessels.  You might want to look at Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia as well.  Documented that the preponderance of terrorists are from those countries.  I understand you think Saudi Arabia is our friend and ally. That women and children walking hundreds of miles to escape political and gender discrimination are the enemy. I understand because Donald J. Trump told you to believe.,On this day in 1981, Ronald Reagan was sworn into office, so it seems appropriate to quote him"...tear down that wall!"
President Trump made 8,158 false or misleading claims in his first two years -- Put another way: The president averaged nearly 5.9 false or misleading claims a day in his first year in office. But he hit nearly 16.5 a day in his second year, almost triple the pace.,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸

Sandy Nicholson nobody wants to migrate to Canada. That’s why lol,No other country has open borders why should we
Bill Lowery We the people elected Democrats to the House. Quit listening to that propaganda Fox News throws out there! Trump couldn't get money for the wall with Republican's in control of Congress, he's not going to get it now.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Judy Feinberg Qualls The Senate passed a spending bill (with no money for the wall) 100-0 in December. The Republican house rejected it. Democrats took control of the House in January and passed that same bill. Now Mitch McConnell isn't even bringing it up for a vote (new session, new vote). This shutdown could end right now if Mitch McConnell wanted to. Trump isn't doing anything to help bring this shutdown to an end.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Kevin Lake Again, its not a vacation. There are people being threatened with eviction, people who could have their services shut off, and people who can't get medication all because they don't have their money now. How is that so hard to understand? Again, if Trump thinks these people aren't essential why doesn't he just fire them and show us who he doesn't care about?,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Nathan Teal you are mistaken, Trump doesn't love anything but himself and money! He hasn't been trying to open the government, he is playing politics for his vanity wall. He owns the shutdown, he said so himself.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Sandy Swaney Mahady by "whats right" I'm assuming you mean pass legislation to re-open the government so those 800k workers can get paid? House Democrats passed a spending bill that Senate Republicans previously passed 100-0. Why won't Mitch McConnell allow a vote?,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Chris Lonas he's not doing anything you goof! I thought Trump was the deal maker? More like a real faker!,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
James Walker the Senate voted on a spending bill 100-0. The Democratic House passed that same bill. Now all we need is for Mitch McConnell to pass it and we're on our way to funding the government. Trump is throwing a tantrum for a vanity wall which the majority of people don't want.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Kevin Lake Then why doesn't Trump just fire those redundant people? I'm sure we'd all like to know who he doesn't care about!,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Kevin Lake great! Good to know you don't care about workers,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Kevin Lake its not vacation for these people. There are real life consequences of Trump throwing a tantrum over his vanity wall. These workers aren't getting paid. Some people are being forced to work without getting paid. I would call that slavery.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Lisa Hertel getting back pay doesn't help if you get evicted because you can't pay rent while you are working and not getting paid.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Takes a big man to copy and paste,No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.   STOP hurting our own citizens - it is IMMORAL.
We the will people will Prevail one way or another we will get our Wall or just piss off the demonrats by having Trump win re-election in 2020 or my personal favorite having them both.  Trump 2020-2024.,Hey here's the problem the dumbrats and George Bush talked about border security. They also talked about building wall I meant a fence. But the fact is none of them had the balls to get it done. So now with one more year till the 2020 election  the dumbrats don't want the  wall built because they won't have those illegal Voters. The Dumbrats also don't won't Trump to go in the history books as a President that kept he's promise to the American People awhile keeping America Safe  and also making America Great once again.
^^^ but a wall will keep us safe from illegals,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
James Campbell ISIS the military force is defeated. ISIS the idea lives on, and the idea is what the radicals are loyal to. Expect to see a lot of sleeper cells popping off in the coming days, as they run out of options with their supply chain and leadership destroyed and default to "blaze of "glory"".,How many shootings are done by American citizens yet you haven't passed many come sense gun laws!
The thing about radical organizations is, even once you've crushed their holdings, supply chain, and leadership, true believers are still going to attack. It's not like fighting a more mercenary or defensive force, where the soldiers will call it quits when the battle is lost and the money runs out. ISIS will keep attacking people until the last idiot who buys into their dogma is dead. Destroying their infrastructure and holdings just removes their ability to recruit and arm said idiots.,Stan Piznarski Stan the man at Bellevue mental hospital, how's it going girlfriend, still on those weekly ECT treatments I see

A conservative challenged liberal Facebook friends to “make a case, not based on emotion” against Trump’s wall. Conservative buddies flooded his post with snide remarks about how this would be impossible for “deluded libs.”  “Okay, I’ll play,” I responded. And in order to avoid being accused of bias, I explained that I would use only conservative sources to prove my point. My primary source was a policy paper by the Cato Institute, a conservative, rightwing think tank, along with other conservative voices (listed at the end of the piece). Here’s why I’m against the wall, I wrote:  1. Walls don’t work. Illegal immigrants have tunneled underneath and/or erected ramps up and down walls to simply drive over them. People find a way. When East Germany erected its wall, it created a military zone, staffed by booted, machine-gun carrying guards ready to shoot to kill. Yet thousands managed to make it to West Germany anyway. More to the point, do we really want to model ourselves after communist East Germany?  2. Most illegal immigrants are “overstayers.” They come to the US legally — for vacations, business, to study, etc. — and then STAY past their visas. By 2012, overstayers accounted for 58% (THE MAJORITY!) of all unauthorized immigrants. A wall is meaningless here!  3. Walls have little impact on drugs being brought in to the US. According to the DEA, almost all drugs come in through legal points of entry, hidden in secret containers and/or among legit goods in tractor-trailers. A wall will have little to no impact on the influx of drugs into our country.  4. It’s environmentally impractical. Walls have a hard time making it through extreme weather. For example, in 2011, a flood in Arizona washed away 40 feet of STEEL fencing. Torrential rains and raging waters do serious damage. Also, conservative sources generally do not address the environmental harm that walls create, but there is plenty of documentation available that show its potential for irreparable damage to both plant and animal life.  5. A wall would forces the U.S. government to take land from private citizens in eminent domain battles. Private citizens own much of the land slated for the wall. The costs of the government snatching private land — and the legal battles that would ensue — are incalculable.  6. Border patrol agents don’t like concrete or steel walls because they block surveillance capabilities. In other words, they can’t mobilize correctly to meet challenges. So in many ways, a wall makes their job more difficult.  7. Border patrol agents say, “Walls are meaningless without agents and technology to back them up.” Are we prepared to pour countless billions annually — after the wall is built — to create a nearly 2,000 mile, militarized 24-hour surveillance border operation? Because according to patrol agents, that’s the only way a wall would work. Again, are we really, going to use East Germany, a brutal communist state, as our model here?  8. Where walls have been built, there was “no discernable impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens.” In other words, they came in elsewhere, primarily where natural barriers such as water or mountainous regions precluded a wall.  9. An unintended consequence is that a wall blocks farmworkers from EXITING when their invaluable seasonal work is done. Farmers are against the wall because it makes getting cheap seasonal labor almost impossible as few American citizens want or can even do those jobs. And if seasonal worker do get in, a wall makes it harder for them to leave! A wall traps migrant farm laborers in our country.  10. Trump’s $5 billion is a laughable drop in the bucket for what would ACTUALLY be needed. For example, according to the Cato Institute: An estimate for a border wall area that only covered 700 miles was originally 1.2 billion. How much did it REALLY cost? SEVEN BILLION. And that’s only for 700 miles. Whatever we think it’s going to cost, experience shows us we have to multiply it by more than 500%.  11. According to MIT engineers, the wall would cost $31.2 billion. Homeland Security estimates it at $22 billion. Given the pattern of spending mentioned in number 10 (plus Murphy’s Law), that means we’re really talking about pouring endless billions into something that doesn’t even work. And, of course, we taxpayers will be footing the bill, not Mexico. Given all the drawbacks, is that REALLY the best use of our taxes?  As the conservatives of the Cato Institute put it, “President Trump’s wall would be a mammoth expenditure that would have little impact on illegal immigration.” (Emphasis mine) Also it would create many “direct harms:” “the spending, the taxes, the eminent domain abuse, and the decrease in immigrant’s freedoms of movement.”  And, we must add, since conservative sources do not — that the environmental harms are likely to be severe.  In other words, the facts show that walls don’t work and they create even bigger, more expensive problems.  So what happened after I posted this conservative-sourced, fact-based list of why the wall is a bad idea?  Silence.  I waited for someone to respond, to engage with me. Where were the angry defenses or rebuttals? But when I searched for the post after a few days, I couldn’t find it.  My FB friend had deleted it. You could say, like Trump with the government, he shut me down rather than deal with the facts.  The ugly genius of Trump is his ability to manipulate deep, primal emotions — namely fear and hate. He, along with Fox News, have convinced his base that they are in “extreme danger” from immigrants and only a wall will make them “safe.”  Unfortunately, the need to “feel” safe is much stronger than the will to grapple with a complex, multi-faceted problem.  And so, here we are, paralyzed by shutdowns at every turn.

Buck Strunk Most other countries have open borders.,No other country has open borders why should we
Terri Reeves no I’m saying Trump did not get that belt. That was a planned build from before Trump was president.,Trump start out by saying let’s build a wall. Are you a Trump supporters cheered him on. Now Trump is saying let’s finish the wall. Again all you Trump supporters are cheering him on.   He hasn’t even started to build the wall. But now you guys are cheering him on to finish it.  All Trump has to do is say he finish the wall.  You Trump supporters walk again cheer him on.  So why doesn’t he just do that.  All this nonsense will be over.
Did you just ignore everyone saying build the wall and say no one wants it. 😂🤣😂🤣😂,Working together requires you to actually give up the idea of a stupid, pointless wall no one wants.  Learn how to collaborate and work with people who have different views than you and learn how to separate fact from fiction.  There are already plenty of bills waiting to be passed that most people ACTUALLY approve of.  Stop acting like a spoiled child.
Lynn Limauro Floyd   Your son was a moron,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL

Steven Whitehead the reason why the majority of the country do not like this president is because he has no idea what he is doing.

Tim Stump don't forget that the reason insurance is increasing is because this administration has taken bits and pieces of it to the point it does not work the way its suppose to. With that being said the Republicans had two years to replace and fix those problems but they instead fought amongst themselves. I can sleep at night knowing that if someone needs assistance because they are sick we can help.

Tunde Lakatos 1) i have the right to post to The President of USA cuz i am also US Citizen.  2) costa rica and USA has exactly the same issue with immigration. This country has people from Nicaragua, Colombia and Venezuela immigrating to CR as illegals. So i Understand Trumps position of immigration. 3) I have a good point to ask something that he promise in campaign.,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
Not to mention he has literally no understanding of what his actual job is, or how the government works. There's checks and fucking balances for a reason, causing a government shutdown over this is nothing short of the most childish thing I've ever seen a grown adult person do,What happens after the wall is built and illegal immigration is still a thing? Which hole are we gonna piss money into then?

Chammy Ney Ney Jr. Can't wait for another 4  years and take back the house.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Nick Moyte well take all doors anyw windows out of your house and let them come and go from your house and you feed them then.,If you think a wall will secure the border you are gigantic dumbass.
But I like trees 😞,Neither A or B. How about impeachment?
Oops my bad billionaire,You just call about money, why cant you just pay for the wall your damn self your a fucking millionaire
Thank you both for loving your country and fellow American citizens with your sacrifice.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Vicki Zamow he wants it to remain in force. Not be undone like Obama's EOs.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Omar Martinez  Can’t you read?,Trump campaign propaganda site. Fake news.  Bots.
Paul Pietrantonio  Bots,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!
Pelosi rejected the offer before it was even made. She's the freaking problem.  #BUILDTHEWALL  #WAKEUPAMERICA,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
She was too busy planning her family vacation.,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Jonathan Burgsteiner and you are the prime example of a White Republican radical “Christian” male. Only Christian when you want to be. Treating females like lower class. Christianity isn’t a buffet, you’re not supposed to take what you like and leave the rest.,Wayne Denny absolutely
Evelyn Warren I absolutely feel the same as you ! I was raised in a democratic house & was a registered democrat for more years than I care to remember .  Even then I voted for Ronald Regan . I shutter to think what kind of shape our country would be in had Crooked Hilary won & all that has been uncovered never saw the light of day !!!,As a former democrat of 40 years, I have never been so proud to have left the party.  President Trump, God bless you.  I am proud to be a Trump supporter.
Give him a chance there friend!,I'm truly sick of hearing about it. Live up to your word...😎
The wall*,They wanted the border also!!  I think we all know, the wall is needed badly!
Kasha Alverson Obambam caused the National Crises!,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Bob Segal -  I don't :),This bitch Laura Trump  is annoying !!!
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin  if you don’t live in America you don’t matter .. so hush!,BUILD THE WALL MAGA ALL THE WAY!!!!
LaVerne Avenatti You need to see a Dr. very soon and get off what ever your smoking and or drinking. Every thing you just said was ALL LIES All of that was Obama.. Obama Ruined our country Obama has no idea what the truth is because he don't know how to tell the truth. Every thing that has every come out of Obama mouth was and still is all lies,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Barbara Hill #Pedogate,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.
Logan Storey Happy Birthday! May your wish come true!,Today is my birthday. I'd like a wall to be built please. Thanks!
Rod Novoa WHY?,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
David Dennison No it suggests some were working on their own agenda and not the administration's.,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Rich Pal both,if someone breaks into your home, does that make them an “illegal resident” or a criminal? 🤔

Kyle Callender Good points and common sense logic ~ Bravo!,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Marilyn Carter look it up. 😊,trump leads through fear. Just don't buy it!!
Bob Segal I've listened to trump. I've seen how he works up his base at rallies. . He's inflated statistics to demonize immigrants, refugees, LGBTQ community, minorities and democrats! He has us fighting each other, hating our neighbors . . . . It's what he does.,trump leads through fear. Just don't buy it!!
Joe Calabrese when Pelosi gets over herself and does the right thing! She doesn’t and didn’t give a rat’s ass about these workers going without a paycheck when she was ready to fly off for a week!! No chance to work this mess out because she doesn’t care about anything other than getting her way! She has some grandiose idea she’s in charge 😂😂 She is the culprit in this shutdown and she is the solution!! Trump has tried to make compromises and she is blocking everything, nothing more than a careless stubborn bitch!😡,Please open the government. My husband has been protecting the public from dangerous inmates and   is working for free. We have two children that we need to feed and provide shelter to! Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.
Arturo Elroy Mañana I want border security and if a wall helps with that, I would rather use that method other than shooting immigrants!! No one single thing is going to work but a wall is a deterrent. We use walls around prisons to help keep the bad guys in, they seem to be doing the job! An escape now and then? Maybe, but nothing is fail proof just added defense! What’s wrong in a steel fence with razor wire to help the men and women of the border patrol in protecting our country? I think it’s not the Wall, you have a problem with, it’s who will get kudos for actually making it a reality!! TRUMP!,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Arturo Elroy Mañana Well, I remember when Clinton in fact both thought the wall and a stricter border control to keep out unwanted illegals.  I saw Obama say the same thing regarding our need for a wall and we had to curtail the influx of illegals. Now, we have someone willing and ready to get the job done but? What happened? The wall is still needed for the same reasons as Democrats wanted then, what’s changed with it being effective? Nothing!!! Except Trump is pushing for it and unless Pelosi gets her head out of her ass, it’s going to be a really tough time for a lot of federal workers! But hey, she can take another vacation she has no worries, right!! Nothing like working for your citizens that support you 🤔,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Arturo Elroy Mañana oops! Didn’t get my point again!🙄 What I’m saying is, if a wall and guards around your home and family is good enough for you, what about our country and citizens!,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Arturo Elroy Mañana why do you think Pelosi, Waters, the Clinton’s the celebrities all have walls around their homes Oh and guards?? That’s not deco !!😳,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house.

Arturo Elroy Mañana lmao stop drugs and illegals is a supply and demand issue?? This is now just ridiculous! You obviously have a invested interest in not wanting this wall to help our border agents!!😳,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house.

Jamie Bennett There really isn't.,Make no mistake, Trump couldn't care less about Americans.  You're a fool if you believe his lies.
John Decker If our country is to be saved from them, hell yes.,Nancy is NOT working for the American people. She is working for the far leftist nut jobs trying to destroy our country. Stand firm Mr. President.
Sarah Knutson BS...us 61 million are laughing at you,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Deceitful 45 the worst and most CORRUPT president in American History! Worse than Nixon!,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
Cora Pantoja Clinton is not president now. We are in the #metoo era NOW. Its shameful that women like you, are trying to normalize sexual misconduct.,Lets meet with the  17 AMERICAN women ADULTEROUS 45 sexually molested!
Bob Frederick we’ve got to stop voting fraud. Democrats will do anything to win power.,The midterms in the House of Representatives was a big surprise to me and to Trump that is why the Democrats think they have the upper hand

Roy Meston  your never going to stop drugs but at least keep the people that do not have any business just showing up in our country uninvited!!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Lonny Watters They are never draining that swamp!! He can only do so much but by shutting the government down I feel was wrong!! Hurting the wrong people!! Now if he threw everyone out of congress I think This whole country would throw a party!!!,Willard Swanke i want a wall built deep and tall.
Ryan Heather Sarah Eller  Because they don’t like him,Sue Howie stay in New Zealand and stay out of American politics funny how foriegners want a say in our President fu
Todd Cuson Wow, i actually grew up in a small town, Woodstock outside of Chicago.  Went to church every Sunday.,I sure am.  Thank you.

Gary Kane GfY,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Anne Crossway ...so... It is ineffective when President Trump wants it, but not when Clinton, Obama or other radical leftists did.  Tell me how that works.  It's the same wall.  This is just a hate campaign...News Flash!!!!!HILLARY LOST 2 YEARS AGO... GROW UP,Just do an executive order and be done with it
The sooner the better.  How is that going I hope well haven’t heard,Willard Swanke i want a wall built deep and tall.
Erin Bond  Ah huh 😁,It would be awesome if you hadn’t colluded with Russia to win the election, and compromise the United States in the process.
Kevin Carlson  Perhaps it us their neediness & connection to drug & human trafficking.,Build a wall on only one border. Looks to me like you don’t like the people on the other side, or why wouldn’t you build it on the Canada side too? You and your followers are motivated by the color of those on the other side of the wall you wish to build.
Vicki Oldham  Child, that was campaign rhetoric.  You didn't expect Mexico to wtite a check did you? It appears that with the mess at their border because of the caravans, they are incurring some expense. We also have a new trade agreement with Mexico.,The promise is, “Mexico will pay for the wall.” Keep your damn promise.
We’re not talking marijuana, we’re talking heroin, fentenol, fake prescription percodine, crack, meth, ectisy, Molly, rat poison cocaine.................,Campaign promise is circumstantial to factual problem: Social and Financial due to illegal immigration and illegal harboring of illegal aliens.
Buck Strunk  Australia has open borders.,No other country has open borders why should we
Carl Ostendarp where are you 300 or more a day,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Sharon Et Trina Bratley at least they problem had a license and insurance also won’t be driving,I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.

Alyssa Ferris  I’m one of the contractors affected by this.  I’m thankful that I’m moving on soon from being an EPA contractor.   I’m glad they are shut down.  I’ve never seen more reckless spending in my life.   I’ve witnessed it for over 10 years, and it’s bad.   Hurricane Maria?   They spent  hundreds of thousands of dollars on a “dog deterrent system” for their employees for stray dogs, which was an umbrella that you “open aggressively” and every employee had a class over how to operate it.    I’ve seen residential yards excavated that exceeded the action level for lead at 0.1 mg/kg over cost 1 million dollars or more.  And if you take one speck of dirt to the left, it’s below that level.   I saw epa employees jobs being highlighting calendars for hurricane Maria and they had to take off Thursdays.   I saw meetings over where to hang a sign, that involved 100 epa employees, that make 100k or more.  1/10 epa employees are worthless.,Patrick Buster totally! I disagree on politics with some of my best friends... even my husband sometimes. 😂😂
Alyssa Ferris  either way, I’m glad Jill and I met you, and we can have differing opinions and are friends!,Patrick Buster totally! I disagree on politics with some of my best friends... even my husband sometimes. 😂😂
Clinton and Obama are liars,Trumpaganda even on a Sunday!  LIAR
Tijuana is the deadliest city on the planet.  Nice try, nimrod,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
"Donna Brazile admits stealing debate questions for Hillary, but blames the Russians By Thomas Lifson I give Donna Brazile just a few points for finally fessing up (after lying and denying) that she stole and supplied CNN debate questions to Hillary Clinton, helping the establishment candidate triumph over insurgent Bernie Sanders.  But I have to deduct even more points, because she did so in a context of blaming the Russians and partially exonerating herself. The expression “non-denial denial” has a cognate in her non-apology apology.",Democrats are now an adversary of the U.S. and like any enemy of the U.S. they care nothing about National Security and Public Safety..
"Indeed, what the Democrats and Mueller's team seem to be saying is that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election by hacking into the emails of John Podesta and the DNC to reveal how they were interfering in the 2016 elections.  And they forget how former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz tipped the scales for Hillary Clinton over a surging Bernie Sanders.  She interfered in the 2016 election in ways Vladimir Putin couldn't even dream of and arguably changed at least the Democratic Party results and campaign timeline.",Democrats are now an adversary of the U.S. and like any enemy of the U.S. they care nothing about National Security and Public Safety..

Melody Nehls  By the way, Melody, I should have commented that that is a very deep and cogent counterpunch, spoken like a true member of the tRump Crime Family Cult.  You win!,Serious, Real News: My Client Resigned From the White House. It's Time for Trump to Think About His Children and Do the Same  Impeachment should be far from the President's only concern By Martin London (VP Spiro T Agnew’s attorney, back in the day)  The BuzzFeed report that former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has told investigators that, after the election, President Trump instructed him to lie to Congress has raised new calls for impeachment. But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen’s testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions “internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents”) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family — specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. — knew the details of Cohen’s secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as “deep involvement” in the discussions with Russia — a subject they’ve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had “extensive discussions” with the family members. The outlet’s two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them “very detailed updates.” If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump’s firm support in the Senate — which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House — dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President’s immediate concern is Mueller. This is not like Trump firing of then–FBI Director James Comey, which lawyers can challenge because it was technically within the President’s constitutional power to do so for any reason, good or bad. This is conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony. There can be no argument that the President has the Constitutional authority to conspire to, say, cause somebody to rob a bank — or commit any other felony, such as giving perjurious testimony concerning the President’s conduct.  Don’t forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex–campaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President’s power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer — and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?  At some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment. The longer the President waits, the more evidence piles up, and the tougher it will be to get a deal. Mueller already has a federal grand jury hearing evidence that just received a six-month extension. The President should make his deal before that body completes its work. The Mueller report may accompany a clutch of Mueller indictments.
Melody Nehls  Really, cultist, because I don’t lie repeatedly to the American people.

Bob Segal  and Cora: Bob is showing us that the poll I referred to was 1POINT OFF - and the one below it, which I should have quoted, would have been accurate.  A ‘stone cold lie’ or the wrong line which put me one point off, using Bob’s proof?  Please.   Cora, snowflake, don’t defend the popular vote when speaking about the Electoral College President. Actually, the poll that said she would win the popular vote was correct, wasn’t it, by 3MILLION?!   Why do you guys get so uppity on issues where you are only marginally correct or incorrect?

It's Time for Trump to Think About His Children and Do the Same  Impeachment should be far from the President's only concern By Martin London (VP Spiro T Agnew’s attorney, back in the day)  The BuzzFeed report that former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has told investigators that, after the election, President Trump instructed him to lie to Congress has raised new calls for impeachment. But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen’s testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions “internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents”) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family — specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. — knew the details of Cohen’s secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as “deep involvement” in the discussions with Russia — a subject they’ve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had “extensive discussions” with the family members. The outlet’s two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them “very detailed updates.” If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump’s firm support in the Senate — which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House — dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President’s immediate concern is Mueller. This is not like Trump firing of then–FBI Director James Comey, which lawyers can challenge because it was technically within the President’s constitutional power to do so for any reason, good or bad. This is conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony. There can be no argument that the President has the Constitutional authority to conspire to, say, cause somebody to rob a bank — or commit any other felony, such as giving perjurious testimony concerning the President’s conduct.  Don’t forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex–campaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President’s power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer — and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?  At some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment.

Robert Decker well I kind of agree with you in one way or another but if you remember history who were the first people here in the United States before people from England landed and discovered America in about Civil War even black people fought against each other from the north to the South people are still killing each other doesn't matter if you're black white yellow green purple or rainbow color people still are killing each other so we either got to get along with each other we are the ones that are killing each other the engines knew nothing about alcohol until the Americans traded them alcohol for their beads and Furs and blankets and their women got to remember we're all from the same father the same mother think about it we all came from Adam and Eve God made Adam first took a rib from Adam and made Eve so there was a first really people in the world their children are descendants of us so we each got to either get along or stay away from each other God bless you all take care of the United States because it belongs to everybody not just bigots it's not our world as gods made in seven days and seven nights he can destroy it and nothing flat the snap of a finger week of a die guns don't kill people people kill people so let's get along God bless you all,mr.

Bette Ristoff Cite one of your "reports". Or were you just screaming like a crazy cat lady because you can't help it?,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!
Dear Madame Speaker:  Due to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate. I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown. Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.  I look forward to seeing you soon and even more forward to watching our open and dangerous Southern Border finally receive the attention, funding, and security it so desperately deserves!  Sincerely,  Donald Trump,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!
Joseph Hart You'll get paid every cent brother. That being said, if this shutdown prevents you from feeding your kids then you are a fucking loser. ...or were you just using a catchy phase to sound profound?,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!
Drew Mullen I agree. It's disgraceful that Democrats would choose weak borders over American workers.,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!
I have an incredibly kind heart. I hope they all make it into America ...LEGALLY. You can't properly vet an illegal - you just can't. Fund the border wall and everyone gets paid. It's that simple. Every LEGAL American wins that way.,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!
Only one party is trading Border Security for illegal votes. That's the Democrats. TSA isn't getting paid because Democrats favor illegals over America's safety. All for votes ...not for anything else either.,Keep the government shut down until 2020 for all I care. Build the Wall!

Ryan, you're a special kind of STUPID! !!!!!!,Was the dude who just murdered 5 people and injured police officers in Aurora, Il an Immigrant? Or do their lives not count because an American citizen murdered them? Just curious, Because I see conservatives mock school shooting victims, but then try to claim a moral high ground when a criminal who happens to be an immigrant attacks someone.

Britney Joray, and it's all because the Democrats don't want President Trump to be President because they Hate Him, They Hate the American People who elected him and they Hate America!! We still have a loving God who could still save them if they want it!!,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!
Darrell Reid, No I do hear how much you hate the most successful President since President Reagan!,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!!

Harold Kupers, it's not all about me it's what he is doing for this country, besides what he has done for me!! This country has a booming economy and when I ran a corporation in NYC I always said we needed a businessman to remove all the crippling regulations and high taxes to allow businesses to grow and hire more people,  he is bringing respect back to our military and police officers who sacrifice their lives to provide our security!! Our Country is a safer and more economically capable of bringing the American dream to all those who seek it legally!!,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!!

Diane Ohize, That analogy of a wall that separated two countries, one free and the other over a communist dictatorship is typical of the kind of narrative the Democrats sell to the vulnerable and uneducated for many, many year's now!!If criminals from other countries were sneaking into a communist country seeking a better life you could use it however we know it's apple's and orange's so let's just "their you go again" do you remember Regan using that phrase everytime the Democrats would try and slip one through the goalie!!,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE LOVE YOU!!!
I love watching trump lose everyone knows it’s a trump shutdown he thought he would make deals through twitter but he’s losing like a bitch maybe a hooker pissing on him would cheer him up,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Kenny Kats u and I will build it with cardboard paper 😂😂😂,Build that wall!!
A step in the right direction,a wall Maybe just a little Band-Aid on a gaping wound
what about all the mass shootings you have in America? Pretty sure that’s not related to immigrants!!,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
You have a wise daughter.,Donald Trump you will get the wall and a lot more.  And of course, Pelosi and Schumer will take credit for it.  Obama will say he orchestrated it back when he was just a freshman chimp.  But who cares, you're getting the wall.
Josh Gr , no, that was Hillary, giving 20% of our Uranium to Russia. Don’t you have enough to do in Canada having to deal with Trudope ruining your beautiful country?,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Brent Robinson Mueller will solve the problem once the Orange Orangutang is arrested and thrown in jail.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Anthony Clark  They’re gonna have to buy cars manufactured in the States, they gonna pay alright,Why isn’t mexico paying for it? 😂😂😂 damn y’all dumb 😂😂
Brandon Joseph Long  Mass shootings are minuscule compared to other murders and homicides done by illegals,There are far more stories of white right wing men doing a mass shooting.
They’ll have to pay for stuff they use to get for free,I know 500 people who were shot almost killed in Vegas.... Anything being done about that?  Your promise that Mexico will pay for it died yesterday 😂😂🤣🤣🇲🇽🇲🇽
Jason O'neal  A lot just cross the desert, usually the really bad ones with records too,The vast majority of illegal immigrants that cross the southern border enter this country do so in cars through ports of entries how is the wall going to stop them?
Mwangi Kanothe  Mass shootings are a drop in the bucket they just get more attention,5 people died yesterday out of a machine gun in illinois that's the emergency Mr President assault weapons,your border emergency is crap made up in your head
Sergio Simone  Because a convicted murder, shouldn’t be allowed to come in,,Seriously how many Americans kill people what kind of a stupid reason is that
Steve Cotton  Should’ve been armed and protected them,,A white guy killed my family member with a gun.   All i got was thoughts and prayers
Whittley Guidry Garcia  Because a lot of crime is caused by illegal criminals,,Paulo Americo Rocha I can't see the comments private message me
Anthony Tan  haven’t sleep?,Indeed

Albert Kojo Kyekye stay in your lane!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Ruben Radar Rodriguez 👍,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Canals need water, right?,Turn that border into a canal! Dig it deep enough that the sides become a natural wall. Then the US and Mexico get trade growth from the canal being used, and we get a deterrent to illegal border crossings!
Jason Jones  a canal in a drought desert area????,Turn that border into a canal! Dig it deep enough that the sides become a natural wall. Then the US and Mexico get trade growth from the canal being used, and we get a deterrent to illegal border crossings!
James Kenney yes but a new car and expensive cell phones are not a necessity. Like I said people spend what they make. There are ways to save and make cuts. Each person is responsible for their expenses. I realize sometimes expenses come up that aren’t planned. I am old school and if you can’t pay for it you don’t buy it. I know people have to have a home and I am not talking about that.,I agree we need to have secure borders but get the government open so people get paid. Granted people should plan with emergency money put aside but the reality is people spend what they make.
James McCaskill If you support the wall call this number 800-350-6647 then press 1 it tells the government we want the wall. I just did it.  Copied and reposted Nancy's number 202-225-4965 left message... build the wall. Here's Chuck's 202-224-7433. Be professional, but demand the wall funds.  Repost numbers. Let's do this. Leave a message, Build the Wall! Everyone call!! Fill their machines with BUILD THE WALL!!! If mailboxes are full PRESS 3 and leave a message.,Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets. But if you listen to mainstream media or the Democrats nothing wrong with our borders.

Stan Piznarski yes absolutely,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Arturo Rosales ask the Democrats.  Since the large majority of mass shootings arw done by them!!,Do they also work for mass shootings???? 🤔🤔🤔
Maureen Hersey Brown becaus theyre braindead sheep!  They believe what the evil scum tells them!,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
Build wall along the Mason Dixon Line.,BUILD THE WALL!
Sophie Tkacz Wildrick 😂 Holy Jesus I needed that belly laugh. Donald Trump was born into wealth. His first car was a limousine. He hasn’t wiped his own ass in decades. His handlers do it for him. What’s tragic though is you admire and worship  him. He’s nothing more than a two bit thief. He will go down in history as the most corrupt person to ever occupy the oval office. Live with that Sophie dear,Your highest and most important duty? How about right after your first priority of fleecing anyone and everyone of every last dollar you can? They don’t call you Don the Con in Manhattan for nothing Mr. President.
They  cant can’t legally build  it  that  way.,Go fund me page to build the wall 330,000 people have donated 19,000,000 dollars in 23 days
Richard Boudreaux they will... first you have to build it and than get paid from Mexico.... its gonna take a little time.... Ill be laughing when Mexico pays for it without knowing about it....,Build the Wall and build a wall around the liberals and California...

A ladder is even cheaper.,Thank you President Trump !!  We need the Wall.  WALL is CHEAPER !  The additions and upgrades proposed by the Democrats will incur Information Technology infrastructure costs that will eventually exceed the cost of the wall. New digital sensors, cameras, outdoor wireless repeaters, expensive servers to monitor the new equipment, expensive switches to carry the network load. Remote hardware stations needed to allow access to sensors in remote areas.  Digging to extend hard wire networks.  Server updates, sensor and camera firmware updates, switch firmware updates.  The IT costs alone are mind boggling.  THE WALL IS CHEAPER !!!!

I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
Who you calling stupid I flunked math but my intelligence is above average!   99 percent of people surveyed say they are above average.     And the other half is even higher, if you asked them about their children.,Trump lies for example in the sotu he said one out of three women in the caravans are molested.    The mainstream media looked into it and found trump lied.     Only 31 percent of women in the caravans were found to be molested!  Impeach trump and lock him up!

We can safely live w/o walls in Germany. We've teared them down in 1989. We don't need an arsenal of automatic firearms in every household.......and we have a community which cares for refugees in solid living conditions. That's where the difference is to be lead by a government without everyday lies,Sheryl Whitfield-Tolliver   love your irony........hahaha  - seriously not a consent comment
The deepest swamp in the US is the corrupt Trump family - that's the national emergency,Sheikh F Shahel hello
Sheryl Whitfield-Tolliver   love your irony........hahaha  - seriously not a consent comment,Jo Sechi Drugs kill more people than gun related deaths, so does vehicle drunk driving! How much of this countrys drugs come over our borders????? Over 90%!!!!! Several weeks ago tons of Fentanyl was confiscated at the border, enough to kill thousands!!!! Yes, Jo do some fact checking BUT DO it through a reputable source. My advice; Christian based news, Washington media research, call your senator's to keep informed of bills being passed!!!! STOP listening to bias propaganda, it make your debate ridulious.
Ruben Radar Rodriguez your a patriot mate keep it up,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Emily Neal we are discussing the wall.,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
Maureen Hersey Brown its the democrats,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(
So Todd what about your BJ  Clinton was getting in the white house 🤔,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Karen Keele He's RIGHT THERE but YOU choose to believe the propaganda. And you think HE'S deluded? Good God.,No wall for you.  But be of good cheer, no one with half a mind expected you to keep your word or tell the truth.
I'm american, it's not my #1 concern.,Where would trump be without ignorant, scared, white women?
Jill Travassos Not true, not even close. Let's see your source, because you are either lying or someone misled you.,Where would trump be without ignorant, scared, white women?
Admittedly May is a nightmare but Europe is finished we are the first to leave but not the last,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Ass,Eric Wroblewski thank you
That blathering idiot obama is the reason this is happening now, the wanna be celebrity did nothing,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Kasha Alverson,do you call housing, feeding ,medical care ,educating the children,ten's of thousands each month a manufactured crises,when does it STOP,we have enough Homeless Americans that we cannot provide for.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
It seems to be doing fine compared to the US.,Rebecca Higgins Meisner you talk to much jackass
Trump and his base need to dial back the name calling. The House has a Democratic majority and Trump won't get a single bill passed if he can't get some Democrats to support him. Calling them "evil" and "dim" isn't likely to work.,Rod Novoa ~ President Trump is the Greatest President in American history. Evil Obama almost destroyed America ~ President Trump is having to clean up the wreck he made!!
You are stuck with her for 2 years, just like we are with Trump.,If we don't defeat Pelosi we cease to be relevant.
No one says the border is, or should be, open. You obviously don't ever cross the border or you would know that.,No other country has open borders why should we
Tom Peden travelling outside the US might give you some perspective.,No other country has open borders why should we
That wall was just a campaign gimmick to remind Trump to talk about immigration at his rallies. He didn't even intend to build a literal wall, but when he tried to back off and say he just meant border security, his base screamed no, we want a real wall. So now he is stuck, being brought down on an issue he didn't even care about.,We voted for Pres Trump, but since he won't build a wall, and shut down the border, we're not sure at this point if we will vote for him !
Trump and his base need to dial back the name calling. Now that the House is under Democratic control he won't get a single bill passed without Democratic help. Calling people "evil" isn't going to work.,I feel so sad that you Mr. President have to take so much from the CORRUPT and EVIL Dems, but I THANK YOU for Putting Our Country FIRST !!!!
Trump loves the ego stroking that comes with the SOTU. All those legislators, Supreme Court justices, honored guests, etc. If he gives a speech somewhere else it is just another speech. He wants the pomp and circumstance that prove he is the President.,President Trump, instead of having the SOTU Address being held in Congress, maybe move it to either the oval office or the southern border itself and stand with Border Agents and Angel Parents.
Source? Maybe among Republicans but no polls show even a majority among the general population.,Trump 2020, he Is our president, has 70 percent approval for the Wall.
Tax cuts for billionaires were more urgent.,He had two years to address this 'critical' issue and did nothing.
Trump and his base need to dial back the name calling. Now that the House is under Democratic control he won't get a single bill passed if he can't get enough Democrats to support him.,Keep everything shut down till you get us that wall ...Screw the democraps
Not much winning so far.,Joel Nash...God bless you
Stick a fork in him?,You’re well done.
Remember when Trump set up a commission to try to prove that illegal immigrants were voting? They found nothing.,Well, then it is obviously the goal of the democrats to weaken the US from within so that it's easier for them to let in illegal immigrants to vote for them and maintain their power :3
If it wasn't an emergency during the two years when he had GOP majorities in both chambers of Congress, I doubt he can prove it is an emergency now.,Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
The wall won't actually help. Everyone wants border security, but the money should be spent on things that will actually work, like more personnel, high tech border surveillance technology, more immigration judges and so on.,Wished I knew what 316 of you morons find so funny, he's exactly right.
That is just a small fraction of the total cost. Trump would have to pitch another tantrum every time the budget comes up for a vote.,The security of our southern border in perspective…. President Trump is asking for 5.7 billion out of an annual budget of 4.407 trillion …. In other words President Trump is asking for $57 out of an annual budget of $44,070 …… think about that for a minute. Put that in perspective…. Imagine your wife/husband saying we’re not going back to work, the kids are not going back to school and no bills are being paid unless you give up the idea of spending $57 to fence in our yard…. This is what Pelosi, Schumer and the democrat obstructionists have halted our government for.
This will be Trump's biggest problem. He is demonizing Democrats, but since the House now has a Democratic majority, he can't get a single bill passed if he can't get any Democrats to vote with him.,Wake up people. The wall between the left and the right in Washington DC is probably the most impermeable wall ever constructed it's not a physical wall but it's definitely an impermeable wall.
And people in Hell want ice water.,Today is my birthday. I'd like a wall to be built please. Thanks!
Lol, right. What are you smoking? Are people going to check a box on their tax forms saying "I oppose the wall, fine me."??,What if Trump fined everyone against his wall like Obama did with obamacare
And please make him smarter. Amen.,Thank you Mr. President Trump. Thank you Lord, please Lord Bless our President to govern this country. Protect him from harm, from evil, Keep him away from danger.  Thank you Lord Amen.
From 2009 through 2014, there was a net loss of Mexicans. More migrants left the US than came here. Who was President back then?,This will help immigrants to realize they have to come legally and safer for them.  Our country will turn into a country the immigrants are leaving if we don't have order
Just because it was a campaign promise doesn't mean it is a good thing to do. If a Democrat promised Medicare for all, do you think Republicans would say "well, it was a campaign promise so let's do it."?,WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO THOSE DEMOCRATS IS STOPPING YOU FROM FULFILLING ONE OF YOUR PROMISES PRESIDENT TRUMP!! THAT'S WHAT YOUR HATERS ARE DOING!! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT BUILDING NO WALL!! THEY JUST HATE YOU FOR TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR AMERICA!! THAT'S IT!! THEY DON'T LIKE THAT NOR DO THEY LIKE YOU!! DON'T EXPECT FOR YOUR HATERS TO SUPPORT YOU & WORK WITH YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!! IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN!! LET'S GET THE WALL BUILT WITHOUT THEM HATERS!! LORD, PLEASE HAVE YOUR WAY & HELP OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU WANT HIM TO ACCOMPLISH IN JESUS NAME,  AMEN!! THANK YOU JESUS!!  :) PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 2020!!  :)
Trump and his base need to dial back the name calling. The House has a Democratic majority and Trump won't get a single bill passed if he can't persuade people to come together on some common sense moderate measures. Calling people "evil" or "dim" isn't likely to work very well. 😁,and that is just what the evil demonRats want....the USA destroyed.
Trump and his base need to back off on the name calling. Now that the House is under Democratic control he won't get a single bill passed unless he tries to treat people with respect.,How about Dems have a little respect for our countries security and what made this country great and realize that what they are doing is far from helping THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!
Calm down. Everyone wants border security. We just want the money spent effectively on more personnel, high tech border surveillance technology and so on. Not on a wasteful monument to Trump's vanity.,Phoebe Cassandra Smith it is a matter of security not vanity. Maybe you should leave this conversation to the adults..
Like crazy Rudy?,We are with you President Trump. We have another Invasion on its way and two more after that. Whoever is Leading these Caravans needs to be Arrested. We see Lawyers down there from here encouraging these people. Please tell me we are not paying for these Lawyers. Any Lawyer who goes against our Law should be disbarred.

OMG I would take Trump over your PM anyday!,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
he needs to keep saying it until congress stops obstructing what common sense tells us we need.,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.

Joel Bernardini, really? THAT is what you see? There are more important things to look at.,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.

Art Gage ...he is a troll.   I guess the Democrats won't text him so he has to look elsewhere.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Simon Cardinal those are all problems we have to worry about, of course. There's no debate here. the point here is that the wall has nothing to do with the fact that somebody has been killed. the point is that trump is using a specific situation that has nothing extraordinary to prove his point on a global issue. You cant build a point on such an important issue by playing with peoples sentiments using tragedies. En fait c'est simplement de la malhonnêteté intélectuelle et cela est une preuve parmis tant d'autre que cet homme exploite les sentiments, les émotions et des stratégies trompeuses dans ses discours afin de contourner toute réflexion rationnelle puisque c'est un terrain où il s'est avéré être incapable de gagner.,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans
Terri Reeves well I dont know much about Chicago but I know that here, in Canada, there are probably only as much murders in a year than in Chicago alone, maybe less,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans
Well I wont be a politician later but yeah it was obviously a statement on the president priorities. Gun control might be a bigger problem in the US considering the thousands of deads it could save every year. But I guess now it's all about our opinions, values and interpretations of the stats about each of these issues,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans
🆗👍,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Jeremy Stephens North Korea, the country that made nuclear threats towards the USA. But obama never had the guts to start a dialogue with them. CNN never told you that.,thanks for saving the country
True, Presidents Trumps 289 accomplishments since the election has restored America to greatness. Let’s not overlook the fact that the world is a safer place since Trump started denuclearization talks with North Korea. No more missiles flying, and North - South Korea in peace talks. The economy booming, millions of jobs, 4 million fewer people on food stamps. Americans can have pride once again, after being ashamed and embarrassed by obama for 8 years.,thanks for saving the country
Angel Adrian Urbina it cant hurt to try and its better than doing nothing even if it stops only half I would take it.,You idioits actually believe itll work lol
Cathy Rohrer-Mackenrodt  first illegal aliens not immigrants and 2nd even though this sounds crazy it's not illegal to be illegal in our country. It has always been they can only be deported if they commit a felony.,I  REALLY  PRAY PRESIDENT  TRUMP GETS THIS  MESSAGE.  IN DELAWARE WHERE I LIVE,  TWO  WEEKS  AGO  THERE WAS  AN  INCIDENT  TO WHERE  AND  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WAS INVOLVED  AND  THE  DELAWARE  STATE  POLICE WAS  INVOLVED,  AS  ONE  OF THE  OFFICERS  ARRIVED I  TOLD HIM  THE  GUY  IN  THERE IS  ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT  AND THIS  OFFICERS  EXACTS  WORDS WERE  “ THATS  A  PROBLEM FOR  IMMIGRATION  NOT  US”.  NOW  WHY  ISNT  LAW  INFORCEMENT  DOING MORE? PLUS  I HAVE A  NAME  OF  ANOTHER  ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT WHICH  WAS INVOLVED  IN  DOMENSTIC ABUSED  CASE  AND  THIS PERSON  WENT  TO  A  DELAWARE  FAMILY  COURT  UNDER  AND ILLEGAL  NAME, SSI ETC  BEING  USED  AND  THE  JUDGE WAS INFORMED  OF THIS PERSON  BEING  ILLEGAL,  WELL  GUESS  WHAT,  NO  OTHER  QUESTIONS WERE  ASKED AND  NOTHING WAS DONE. I FEEL AS THOUGHOUR  PRESIDENT AND  US AMERICANS  WHO ARE  DOING  OUR  BEST  OF  FIGHTING  IMMIGRATION ARE GETTING  NO  HELP  OR  SUPPORT FROM EVEN OUROWN LAWS, POLICE, COURTS  AND/OR  JUDGES.  PRESIDENT  TRUMP  WHY  ARE WE  NOT  GETTING  THE  HELP  WE NEED?
Dave Sienknecht Border busts, Border Patrol agents arrested five men carrying 4 foot tall backpacks with methamphetamine, cocaine and pills over the weekend near Gila Bend. This group was one of 5 groups of smugglers caught by agents in January near Gila Bend. In total, the drugs seized in the incidents was worth about $1.7 million. Customs and Border Protection,The question is, would a wall have stopped this guy from coming here? No, because the vast majority come across ports of entry, not the desert.
Dave Sienknecht nope no way they are coming through the dessert. Really come on, this is a real news report.,The question is, would a wall have stopped this guy from coming here? No, because the vast majority come across ports of entry, not the desert.
Lisa P. Woodruff  Illegal aliens not immigrants,A bigger problem than illegal aliens in this country, a drunk killed your daughter.

Suzanne Burgess Lee FAKE,  give  one  FACT....,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Arnold Bowie He  is  your  President  and  he  is  doing  a  great  job by  putting  America  First.  Research  the  issue  and  see  what  Border  Agents  says  we  need,  WALLS do  WORK....listen  to  Homeland  Security  with  the  actual  facts  instead  of  being  spoon  fed  by  the  ANTI  HATE  TRUMP  media.,No other country has open borders why should we
Samoan Dannielle what  did  DEMS  ever  do...they  will  raise  your  taxes  and spend  the  money.    DEMS  are  the  ones  who  spent  the  Social  Security  funds  and  NEVER  put  it  back  in  the  budget.  The  TAX  CUTS  was  for  all  Americans....for  your  first  $25,000  you  are  not  taxed  plus  President  Trump  gave  Us  more  of  an exemption...PLUS  paychecks  sees  anywhere  from  20  to  100  dollars  more....,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate

Deborah Hathaway King you’re sad that I’m right,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Vicki Zamow you’re an idiot!  Way more people were killed by good old American boys at Parkland and Las Vegas, but President Stupid didn’t mention that did he???,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Kevin Lee Groves and we are here because we are patriots who live our country, and refuse to see trump continue to destroy it.,No wall, not necessary!!! Do your job,  fund the government. Embarrassing that you let Anne Coulter boss you around.  Who is the president, you or her?   Looks like her from where I sit.
Tommy John most likely he will just create another bill to redo the spending, or take the money from another budget.,Its not about the wall, its about that the bill provides amnesty for illegals, limits ICE and hampers our ability to throw the illegals out. I don't know why in gods name he signed that damn thing. Not to mention once again provides an unchecked slush fund to isreal
Tess Calomino no, that happens with all presidential addresses.,Eddie Sturgis scared of the success .. your party better grasp what is happening to the heartland and entire running of our nation.
Vicki Zamow only difference is that Obama was smart, this guys an idiot!,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.

Larry Mitchell when a person doesn't have a decent argument, they resort to name calling, just like a two year old. Grow up, quit spreading rumors. And if you want to bring up him supposedly Not knowing a single bible quote, maybe you should quit being a hypocrite. Here are a couple for you. "Judge not that us be not judged". Or how about "pull out the mote that is in your own eye, before you try to pull out the mote in your brothers eye". Better yet, just shut up!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Beverly Hurst Smith thats because it was just recent that the globalist like Soros started the caravans.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
maybe someone who knows you well gave you some lego,Today is my birthday. I'd like a wall to be built please. Thanks!

Eva Graham you are sad,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
His promise was Mexico was going to pay for it not the tax payers.,Robert Betancourt, so if you were to be up to speed on the facts....Mexico is in fact paying for the border barrier along with substationally much much more through the new trade agreement that replaced the doomed NAFTA.
Beverly Hurst Smith hey dummy he has never had the 60 votes needed. Obummer had the 60 votes when he lied to the voters about Obamacare,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Joan Bentivegna I think he may have needed as many as 10 votes since George Soros’s puppet John McCain was out almost the whole time,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Danny:  Brexit is going to be a disaster, voted on by the same rural rubes who voted in Trump. You are in for a rude awakening when the welfare dries up because of all the lost tax revenue when London loses thousands of high paying fiancé jobs.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Elisa Farina DiCarlo  neither do you so shut up.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
lowes record,Remember Obamacare repeal? Republican House and Senate, Republican president, and Donald whiffed, twice. As I said, the Democrats are not the reason he constantly fails.
Build That Wall no more land of the free handout,Our borders are fine.... worry about healthcare, jobs, and roads
Kathy Solomon the land of the free hand out is over,Everything has been just fine until you were elected now it's a problem
Christopher Thompson , each and every immigrant costs the taxpayers in excess of $50,000 a year. These are figures given by the Budget Accounting Office. Free medical, schooling, and now college yet those things aren’t offered to US citizens....,Those who oppose a wall are obviously hoping to support illegal activities. Search your soul. The cost is a non-issue and pennies in the dollar compared to the outrageous waste of our government.
Craig Shurick , you really think 90% of illegals came through a checkpoint? If so, you are very misinformed.,One man, one incident undocumented as the alleged DUI perp was.   How would a wall have helped?  This DUI perp came through the border like over 90% of these cases do.  Help us understand how a wall would have helped!  This article is NOT a plea for a wall but rather more “border security.”  Every Congress person agrees we need border security.  A wall?  Nah!

John Burks , better phrased as that’s why prisons still have prisoners in them. There are plenty of drugs and weapons in every prison.,Walls work that's why there is no drugs and weapons in prison
Joseph Nowik , ask Obama, he started it.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Joseph Nowik , unfortunately that won’t happen in the future. The use of a National Emergency to eliminate the 2nd amendment won’t happen. Only a fool would try. Global warming seems to be an American thing. The major contributor country’s haven’t done a thing to deal with it. Healthcare isn’t a right. Simply put if a person wants insurance they can buy it. Wether or not they can afford to use it is a different issue.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Kris Landers , they already do hold others responsible. In Drunk driving accidents not only does the driver get sued but also the bar and the server. Same thing for house party’s.,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
Ryan VanBuren , very weak argument,Robert Dahlquist  like the “emergency” we are experiencing, check this out...”I didn’t really need to type it out but I wanna do it fast.”
Tim Koepp , nothing will change until it happens to a politicians family.,No trust me the majority of us we feel for those Angel moms and one was too many this walls going up
Don Januszewski the native american man put himself into that situation ALL BY HIMSELF. The kids WERE NOT bothering him at all. He ever n said it that HE instigated the whole situation. So thus just proves to me that HE IS A LIER AND A SHOULD BE TRUSTED. Also tge kid didn't block him and he was just standing there. My advice there is always 2 sides of the story.,more media fake news..http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=59696&fbclid=IwAR0sPNEQELUeLaKniF9YvhXHlWYaabqtogpj0ZjpTF4C8WwllGjXTRQp9TUHATE HOAX: Native American Activist Approached Chanting Covington Catholic Teens, Got In Their Faceinformationliberation.com

Shannon Laird they could easily use the 14 billion they confiscated from El Chapo but the corrupt Democrats want to keep that to maybe give it to Saudi Arabia,Robert Day good answer. I can live with that. Totally forgot about the Ted Cruz ace in the hole. Thank you.
Paul Gonzales your just as ignorant as a black man crying about slavery. But I guess you think our civil war was about that majority? So forget about taxation without representation. Oh and forget about plains Indians that tried to live peacefully with the white men. One such group was the Sioux tribe. It was the largest and most powerful group in the west. They signed treaties with the government giving up ninety percent of their land. The Santee agreed to live in a small area. In exchange, the United States agreed to make yearly payments to the tribe. This made it possible for the Indians to buy food and other things from white traders.,mr. Trump you need to stand there at the border with your own gun and your cronies and try to stop trying to stop all the Hispanics to come to United States you got to remember history the Nina and the Pinta who were the first people here on this country and this continent it was the natives natives Americans the Apaches the Indians the Incas and all the other Indians that were raised and born here in United States we are not the only go aliens the ones that came here from the Pinta and the Santa Maria when they landed and found America remember you guys were from England you guys are the foreigners not the Mexicans and not the Indians so if you want to put a border put a border on your ass amen God Bless America the land of the natives and the Hispanics so take that to the bank

Emily Neal new laws will not stop a criminal from getting a gun.,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.

Dave Callender.  Don't be asinine.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Rod Novoa  you poor little snowflake I have a safe room you  can use it's filled with unicorns and rainbows I also have lots of coloring books with big crayons and your favorite stickers your  welcome to use it while your great PRESIDENT runs the country the way it should be run.

,Nancy Pelosis phone # is 202-225-4965 call her and voice your concerns. I just did. I asked her if she would take a drug test....the phone went silent and then started beeping all weird. It's sad the way they treat you President Trump. Schumer could never do a deal like you and he knows it. Looked like a trouble teenager in the principals office the other day with you. Democrats cant get rich on their own like you did. They need to steal and lie to get anywhere. Schumer's a rat that needs to go to the nursing home or find a trap. His number is 202-224-7433 but he's too much of a coward to answer.
He wants free stuff, not freedom. Typical,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jerry Risner Amen,Arev Neerg i'm sure your stern message will change his ways. the dems. plan of let them all in isn't a border security plan

Kevin Couture. He is a troll that looks like a child molester.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
That means your stupid ass has to go too, you don't like it here then leave,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Hey Max: Stay in Italy asshole,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
Angel Roy did Mexico pay for it?,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
Ed Ward duh does the word undocumented mean anything to you?,How did Joel Velazquez get to the country? I can't find anything saying how or when he came here.
Danny Jones  Thank you for your sentiment.  Wish we could get the sheep over here to wake up and see reason before we end up in a civil war.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

Dave Callender There is a Mental Institution near you, I think they have noticed you are missing! LOL,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

Norene Boone Obama care is unconstitutional cram that up your ass,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

what?,He's a minute man. I am sure he killed a lot of immigrants. Or allowed them to cross over the border with out properly identifying the immigrants. So where's the justification in that?
GREAT President Donald J. Trump,Fake President.
bs...do you even know what the term means...3-4 victims ...thats  what...take a look at percentages...there are 14 times  the amount of citizens to latinos....350 million to 20 million.....math alone tels you theres going to be more citizens killing ...gangs kill that many on any given weekend.....mass shootings lol...get educated,The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!
what? smh,Trump ur just as bad as cnn. Lets remind the worl how many Americans ate people and buried people . Also many more evil crimes. Lets build a wall is like locking us all in a cell with these American killers. The kkk set nonwhites on fire and tied them to a tree but there able to roam free . Good one trump

and many experts say it will,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
we do...60,000 illegal  entries a month....turned loose into our country awaiting a hearing that only 2-4% show up for...our american citizens aren't afforded that right,Yvonne Webber we elected democrats to the house to stop his tyranny and impeach him. GET OVER IT!

ok for you but not others?,Trumpaganda even on a Sunday!  LIAR
i agree except for the whipping, and we do need a wall so we don't waste expenses on them,I believe legislation would be way more effective than a wall.  If there were no benefits, no work, no way to even move around the country and commit crimes, and there was immediate punishment (whipping) and deportation, then we wouldn't have a problem with illegals wanting to be here in the first place.
i feel bad for you...no one should ever be treated that way.,I believe legislation would be way more effective than a wall.  If there were no benefits, no work, no way to even move around the country and commit crimes, and there was immediate punishment (whipping) and deportation, then we wouldn't have a problem with illegals wanting to be here in the first place.
legally,It's very sad that you lost your child that's horrible. At one time your family were immigrants and needed to come to a better environment to have the necessities for life.
or just walk across because of the lack of other security measures...build the wall,If criminals use Ports of Entry. Why do they dig so many tunnels along the border?
are you really that naive and behind in other current events(except for the hate trump ) that you don't know nk is in russia and chinas hip pocket?,When you said, "I believe Vladimir Putin" regarding the potential of North Korean missiles to hit the US, were you high or out of your mind? Benedict Donald needs to be arrested, interrogated and imprisoned ASAP!
then those countries need to address the fact huh?,USA has killed most people over the world how many Americans cross borders to take advantage of child prostitution and so much to list here that not counting asholes
if the wall would only save 1 life...yours...i'd still fight for it,Send this snake to Satan!
whats GROTESQUE is your opinion...but thats your right,Unconscionable to use one person's tragedy for your own political gain. Even worse to give this man false hope. Because of Trump, this man will feel responsible for additional deaths caused by illegal aliens  when he learns more people will suffer loss like he did (when statistics demonstrate that the resources wasted on the wall could have saved countless others) if only America would have invested in alternative and far better protections than a wall. In addition, this poor Dad will be no closer to bringing his daughter back. Trump is literally compounding this man's tragedy for his political gain. GROTESQUE!
sometimes by the wisdom of force,Triumph comes not by force but by wisdom. A strong wave will bring ruin to what it touches but in its wake you've discovered a cleansing of the shores...
and we have laws against it and enforce them,How many legal citizens kill people in the United states daily?
coming over the border illegally at the rate of 60,000 a month...and not "mexicans" but all illegals, drugs, human traffickers ...it's a very big concern. are you saying we don't have laws and are not enforcing them for your concerns? or programs in place for those in need?,How many kids are killed from school shootings? How many people die from poverty and not being able to afford their medicine? Didn't 16000 veterans kill themselves this year?? But yes the Mexicans are our country's main concern. Idiots.
a man...race has nothing to do with nothing except for racists,How many kids are killed from school shootings? How many people die from poverty and not being able to afford their medicine? Didn't 16000 veterans kill themselves this year?? But yes the Mexicans are our country's main concern. Idiots.
they feel special and don't want to stand in line,I have 3 daughters and can't imagine the pain of losing a child. I'm so sorry for the loss of your child, your beautiful daughter. My grandmother and grandfather both came to this country legally. I support Trump and I support the wall. We welcome anyone, just do it the right way, the legal way. I don't understand why people have such a hard time with that.
or you for defending him?,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
and we enforce the laws and arrest and sentence them,Not trying to be rude but Americans do that all the time either drinking and driving or texting and driving causes accidents
they all do,As thousands of AMERICANS struggle due to the shutdown. Way to go, Mr. President! You’ve sure left your mark now.  I sympathize in the Angel families and believe we need to secure our borders. But what about those that are about to be evicted because they already live paycheck to paycheck?   Despicable!
and you have never done anything bad in yours,Ronald Bettney good work my ass.
at least the dem side...repub sides on solid ground,The house will fall
and theyre on a steady increase now...60,000 a month,Why didn't Trump build a wall two years ago when he had a majority in Congress...Because it was not an emergency. Illegal border crossings and apprehensions have been declining for nearly two decades, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and in 2017 were at their lowest point since 1971. A 2018 study published by the Cato Institute found that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) the majority of illegal drugs coming into the country across the southern border are being smuggled through legal points of entry. In other words, this president has manufactured an immigration crisis for his own political gain.
you should have been more up to date on current affairs then and you would know why...smh,Why didn't Trump build a wall two years ago when he had a majority in Congress...Because it was not an emergency.

keep up with the times , we enforce the laws and prosocute them.do some research . we have gun control.but we wont tolerate a gun ban,Gee..dont you people stay up with news? We have had more shootings in America by white Supremists than by Hispanic immigrants..do some research..you will find that a wall is not going to solve your problems....how about gun control...? Ever think about that?
thats something both parties would agree on but it must be a united country first,Ron O'Hearn   Thanks for commenting But can you be More specific???  I wouldn't agree if our prime Minister gets Marco Rubio and tells and says you are going to be the PRESIDENT!!!! Just because 40 countries  agree to  that!  While Mr Trump still is the PRESIDENT!!!  That would NOT BE JUST IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND MUCH MORE.
it'd be easier to just get rid of you,Can we build a wall around every White American Male, you know just in case they decide to go nuts and shoot up a church, school, concert, etc??
what?,You just made my point.
bigots? how so?,Bigots for Trump^
Bullshit,Bullshit
Sean Walsh your comment doesn't deserve it,Ron O'Hearn you’re back, thank goodness! Hail Trump, am I right?

Kelly Preiss Wilhelm white, black, asian, latino gang shootings,...you have no clue...take a look at percentages of race to murders.....why just blame white...all races do it....even women,I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
Wolf Solstice well even bernie n barack said its been broken for yrs...you'll believe them but laugh at trump when he says it? don't make much sense does it?,I did? When he said he wanted to run for president!
glad you could admit it was broken before he took office,I did? When he said he wanted to run for president!
sure, but a person illegally here that should not have a license?,Ron O'Hearn either way license or no license people still need to drive to get to places like work
whats that have to do with an illegal with no license or insurance...etc...if he weren't  here, it never would have happened,Ron O'Hearn either way license or no license people still need to drive to get to places like work
Buck Strunk  Right....so close Canadian border and Great Lakes and especially the east and west coast....You know those Dem strongholds will let ANY TERRORIST in.,No other country has open borders why should we
Linda Mesopotanese  Yes...Here’s his message: “ You’re f..ked suckers...Lies told lies kept”.,Stay Strong Mr President and give your State Of The Union Message as scheduled and wherever you damn well please! 👍

Look in the mirror for shame,The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them. We see this in the recent drama from Buzzfeed.

If you are, I just hope that you are kind, to the undocumented immigrants, because sometimes they can experience the worst cruelty from their own kind.!!!,How can people just not view west coast drug crime and neverending homeless people with drug psychosis as a direct relation with that border
John n Morris and maybe you need to call 1 866 go Jack off!,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.

Timothy Norton well I`am from europe and President Trump is 100% correct about most european countrys not spending 2% on defence as for the southern border or any border in any country for that matter,you can`t have people wandering about coming and going as they please,from what I have read there is a huge volume of drugs comes into the USA through the southern border,if true thaat alone would be good enough reason for a wall even here in europe it has been a absolute disaster all the migrants getting in and allowed to wander unchecked ,just two days ago a afghan mirgrant stabbed a pregnant woman in hospital they managed to save the woman ,but the baby iis dead,Timothy Norton well I`am from europe and President Trump is 100% correct about most european countrys not spending 2% on defence as for the southern border or any border in any country for that matter,you can`t have people wandering about coming and going as they please,from what I have read there is a huge volume of drugs comes into the USA through the southern border,if true thaat alone would be good enough reason for a wall even here in europe it has been a absolute disaster all the migrants getting in and allowed to wander unchecked ,just two days ago a afghan mirgrant stabbed a pregnant woman in hospital they managed to save the woman ,but the baby iis dead
Joe Stark what a small comment.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
It's a fake emergency.  The facts say illegal immigrants are far more likely to come by plane not Southern borders.  The wall is nothing more than a dog whistle to bigoted supporters that just want a fight to coverup Trumps other legal issues,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.

Amen amen amen,America first! Trump 2020!
Gary Kane you cant possibly be that stupid.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
But it will be much,much harder.Every country who has a wall say their illegal's have dropped from 50-95% success rate.Israel is at 99%.He is on the front lines we just have news to go by,and some choose to listen and salivate to fake news..And those who believe in God and his word the bible,it's in many a scripture.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Jo-Ann Machinist Cassidy not Americans, Russians.,62,000,000 American’s voted for Trump, if we all send a check for 10$ would that cover the building of the wall?
Best President we have ever had,Rod Novoa people like you should be stripped of their citizenship and food and out of this country. That is if you have citizenship you're probably one of those New Yorkers that de Blasio takes a liking to
Brian Lee omg. Such old misinformation. Try something new,A 5 times draft dodger fight???
Jacqueline Alas doesn’t count they just claim mental issues or there problemd lives. Very sad.,An American just murdered 5 Americans and this is his focus 🤦🏻‍♀️
Sam North they will just claim mental issues and get away with it they always do.,A legal citizen shot and killed 5 Americans yesterday.
Liz Hall Believing his lies doesn't make you informed.,Liz Hall Believing his lies doesn't make you informed.
,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
The wall is a waste of money, time, energy. It's useful only to feed an ego. Invests in technology and education.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Hal Eric Mitlitsky you lefties keep regurgitating that mantra about gun control. So stupid, its in the constitution. Also did any of you lunatic leftwings know that Obama already did it 12 times in his Presidency? Btw, we dont give a rats @$$ what  names you whiney sore losers call us. We have names for you too.The dems have to bring in outsiders because the American citizens see they are not for the betterment of this country. Patti Cullen, try telling that to Ms. Pukelosi or the 12 times Obama did it.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Camille Ortiz Marroquin oh ffs go sit down...,Eric Wroblewski thank you
If we would stop paying the illegals that are already here, the ones held at the border we could..  You are paying congress and the illegals becky lao,,  unless your on welfare..  then we're paying for you also..,Americans overwhelmingly know you’re a fake
why do you think we need a wall,, they don't just come through the airports ya know..  tell it congress..,Right now we need security at our airports where we are actually stopping thousands on our terror list. Agents aren’t being paid.  You sir are a fraud.   Do us a favor and crawl back into your reality tv hole    You make a piss poor human.
A wall will help,, and your an idiot,, Not keeping america safe is treason.. and it's people like you that will get us all killed..  its not just a wall,,  go back to bed..,STFU You are so disgusting in every sense 🤮. #TreasonIsTheReason #PutinsPuppet #LockHIMup Stupid people believe a wall will keep the drugs out...newsflash...they use tunnels 🤦🏼‍♀️. Give me funding for technology not a useless wall
That was really ignorant Marilyn Weiner..  Why do we need sanctuary cities for illegals if we're all supposed to be so safe.??  This is our country not theirs..  I have rights also..,If DONALD TRUMP THINKS IMMIGRANTS ARE SO DANGEROUS, WHY DOES HE KEEP MARRYING THEM?
Teresa Collins Batchelor Presidents have been giving the State of the Union address in person only about 100 years. There is no requirement that it be done in person.  Pelosi is just showing her ASS.  Text, call, or write her and tell her what you just posted!,I have a question, you are require to give congress a state of the union address but Representative Pelosi has stated that is her house and because of security reason you can give it. (It's Americans house but we won't go there for now). Why can't  you address the other chamber of congress? Send her the address on paper like she wanted but give the address from the Senate floor.

Sorry Chammy Ney Ney Jr..  I tagged the wrong peson...This question is intended for James Ahssanipoor. So here it is ole buddy.   James thinks Hillary Clinton did NOT have textual relations with that server.  I mean........ anyone could accidentally delete 33,000 e-mails that would incriminate them. Right? He wants Hillary Clinton back in the white house with Bill Clinton by her side. That way Bill coud have wild passionate monkey love in the oval office on TAXPAYER'S money. Hey James. .. Did you know that Monica Lewinsky had a birthday recently? She's in her 50's now. It seams like only yesterday that she was crawling around the white house floor putting anything she could find in her mouth. They grow up so quickly these days. Don't ya think so James? Hillary Clinton will screw over America in a Benghazi minute.... but just answer this question James.... If you didn't vote for Trump,  who'd ya vote for and why? That's a VERY simple question. A simple answer will do just fine.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.

I'm done with him. I've asked 5 times.  He obviously doesn't want to put a comment statement on here..... because he doesn't know how to answer the question. It's EXACTLY what I expected.... and EXACTLY why I continued to ask. It was to prove a point. I've done that. So y'all have a nice day. I've got to get out my 4 wheel drive John Deere tractor I paid cash for and grade the snow off my 7/10 mile long driveway into my farm here in Kentucky... so my wife can get her Chrysler 300 M out of the garage and make it up to the guest house. Dang! I just wish I had that CFO money that ole James Ahssanipoor makes. That way I could pay someone to do that for me. That dude says he NEVER has to work because he's obviously rich. You know....  being CFO and trader and all. He's not conceited either! He's just convinced! BAHAHAHAHA  You've at least been VERY cheap entertainment James. Have a nice day sir. 😂,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
I've read every one of them. ALL that I asked for is for you to say I voted for....   Because...... But I guess that's just too difficult for a CFO that says they NEVER work. It actually requires a minimum amount of WORK. Really not difficult. You're just not willing to answer the question because I'll make you look stupid.  Too late pal. By NOT answering. You already do.  Just sayin.....,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
James Ahssanipoor  STILL circling the airport. You said who cares about Hillary. That's something we agree on. I didn't want her back in the white house either. That's why I voted for Trump. So I'm gonna ask another time. Who did you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? It's such a simple question. How come you're not willing to answer the question? A smart CFO like yourself shouldn't have a bit of problem coming up with a very quick answer. How come it's taking so long....you never answered my question?,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
James Ahssanipoor  When are you going to stop circling the airport and land the plane? I've asked you a VERY simple question 3 times. I'll ask it again. Who did you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? Your CFO of your company. Surely it ain't gonna be that hard for you to answer. So stop sidestepping it. Ya want to stop circling the airport and bring it in for a landing? Who'd you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why?,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
James Novotny  I wonder what the news media would do if Trump announced in Helsinki that he was giving Putin 20% of our Uranium reserves in exchange for a donation to his private foundation who's records are stored on a private server in his basement.,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.

As a mother who lost her child at the hands of failed immigration policies, I know just how important border security is to American families.  I watched my son, Javier Vega, Jr., gunned down by two illegal aliens who viciously ambushed our family while we were on a fishing trip in Texas.  Javier served his country as both a Border Patrol Agent and a U.S. Marine, but he spent his last moments bravely defending my family from these ruthless animals.  Any mother who has lost a child in this way can attest that there is nothing more gut-wrenching than knowing that their sacrifice was entirely avoidable.  Politicians had neglected their responsibility to keep my son safe by ignoring our country’s desperate need for immigration reform for decades.  Three years ago, Donald Trump gave new hope to every American family like mine that has lost a loved one at the hands of illegal aliens who never should have been allowed into the country in the first place. “I hear you, I see you, and I will never let you down,” he promised us.  Since then, President Trump has never wavered from his promise to protect our families by building a wall on the southern border.  When the media ignored us, he listened. When the politicians mocked us, he comforted us.  Because he understood how failed immigration policies destroyed our families, he brought our stories to the forefront of the public consciousness and fought tirelessly to make our plight known.  President Trump gave a voice to Javier and the countless others whose lives were taken by illegal immigrants, and I am forever grateful to him for that.  But Javier’s story is just one of many that never made the headlines and likely would have gone unheard and unaddressed if not for the President’s unrelenting commitment to fix our broken system.  That’s why it’s so important to see this fight through to the end. We cannot let another child become collateral damage of the reckless open-border agenda.  Of all the promises President Trump has made and followed through on, fixing our broken immigration system is the most important.  In my home state of Texas alone, over a quarter million criminal aliens have been arrested and charged with over 600,000 crimes in just the past seven years.  My family paid the ultimate price for the failed immigration policies that allowed these crimes to happen, and I owe it to my son to demand accountability from the elected officials whose indifference cost him his life.  I am not alone. The majority of Americans overwhelmingly oppose illegal immigration and want a safer country. That’s why we elected Donald Trump to be our President.  He’s always had our backs, and now we want him to know that we have his.  President Trump, now more than ever, we support you in your battle to resolve our border crisis before more American families experience the tragedy mine has had to endure.  Marie Vega is a proud mother of two sons who served in the US Marine Corps. One was Border Patrol Agent Javier “Harvey” Vega Jr. and the other is mineral well engineer, Jordy Vega. She works as a bookkeeper at a local law firm.,Eh Dipshit, Open the Government and pay them now ! Stop negotiating using the lives and livelihood of Federal employees  !

Dennis Bottkol  Obama shut down the government.  Clinton shut the government down.  Reagan shut down the government.  The very first government shutdown didn't start in December of 2018 under Trump.  5 years ago ALL 54 Democrats in the house agreed to spend 40 billion dollars on border security.

Kolja Beckmann what are you talking about? Germany is one of the safest, if not the safest country in the world. So what if they let a bunch of Islamic refugees in, what have they done to Germany that is so bad? Besides crime, rapes, child grooming, attacks on Germans etc etc.....,I wish - actually not so much 'my' - Chancellor Merkel would understand this.  Much love and support from Germany. If you do this and they'll see it works they will have no excuse here as well. This project is important far beyond the US. And that's why they fear it. So good luck my brothers and sisters in the US.

,Don't let this distract you from the the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, "Spare Tire" Dixon.

No, this falls on the democrats solely.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Gary- why do you liberals speak with nothing factual to offer. Are you blind, or stupid? Probably both.  This falls solely on the democrats and the longer they continue, it ensures Trump's second term by a landslide.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
No the majority of Americans want a wall. Technology so far hasn't stopped the illegal aliens. That's like someone walking into your house while you leave the door open, but the alarm system and CCTV will stop them. Dumbass,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
– If we don't have the funds to build the wall along our own southern border – Then stop sending American tax-payer funded financial aid to foreign countries, stop financial aid to illegal aliens, stop importing cheap labor, stop allowing and enabling US jobs and industries to be outsourced to foreign countries and do not import foreign fuel, steel nor electronics used in our military weapons, national defense systems and power grids – Build the wall and guard the border using our drone and satellite surveillance systems to find and turn back unauthorized intruders – Also, hire our veterans and former law enforcement officers to monitor and minimize visa over stays.  This is The United States of America, it's our country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant – What the American People clearly want and need are more elected officials that will actually start putting the best interests of our own US CITIZENS first and foremost, and that includes appointing judges and others that will do the same.  For the first time in 30 years, we finally have a president that's actually doing something about our traitorous trade and immigration policies – And the corrupt manipulative media, establishment puppet politicians and their globalist masters are blatantly fighting President Trump and the American People tooth and nail every step of the way.,America first!

Stay strong yourself. I’ve been wondering how people affected view the issue, as that’s what matters. God bless. If necessary, find another as this might take awhile.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Linda Acree I doubt that but that is the American way,Linda Acree I doubt that but that is the American way
Brent Robinson wrong trumps ratings are down and any thing hes says or does is for his ratings,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

Dave Boyer Little Dummy, aren't you?,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Joe Nash 20 years from now he will be remembered as the worst and the first criminal President in the White House.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rod Novoa He will be removed soon. This entire scenario is about him and to satisfy his base. The Democrats want border security too but the fool wants his stupid wall.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sarah Knutson too many stupid people. He could piss in their faces and they still would feel blessed.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Barb van der Burg So literally the only place I found this article was on a site called "crooks & liars" I really try to do research to see if you Dims are correct but once again it's just Trump Derangement. Did CNN have anything to do with this? We all know they've gone over the cliff when it comes to Trump.,Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Norene: Obama held the American's hostage for Obamacare. He then overreached his power & signed into law the DACA program which is an illegal program. Anything to do with immigration must be passed by Congress not by EO...They wouldn't pass it so he basically said "screw you I'm signing an EO for it". You asked if walls would protect someone. Do your fences protect you? Do your doors protect you? Why do you have them then if you feel these aren't protecting you? I grew up in Nogales, AZ...Believe me it is in a crisis situation.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Faye Lemke Hamilton It starts at the top like the charlatan in chief said when The Great President Obama was in office. Now 45 is swindling people out of pay like he's been doing for decades before he had Russian help to steal the presidency.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Lenny Anders That's the best comment so far. BTW it won't be the current charlatan in chief.,Thomas Harrington kermit the frog would be a better choice at this point and he's a real puppet. You sir are the DMF.

Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
Give one actual reason. Not your opinion but a undeniable fact that is ground for impeachment,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Josh Gr yeah we can talk about Russia 2.5 year long investigation with nothing to show for it aside from wasted money...but a wall is wasting money and republicans can’t do that. Only dumbass’s (Democrats) can waste America’s money.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Katherine Ricciotti Ooh I know he can’t. All he can do is the same bs everyone else like him does.

yeah..there is lots of them,No wall
why wouldnt they?,Quit holding our government hostage.  Most people don’t want this wall.

Wendi DelValle Im so sorry for your loss. Lets hope this wall gets built. Maybe it should be engraved with the names of all the lives that have been lost because we didn’t have it.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Joel Bernardini u r a sad person to be wasting you time on here with this remark'- I suppose if your child had been killed from some one illegal - u would be more respectable.,Just curious why you find the need to photoshop your pictures to make you appear not obese.  Seriously, they’ve shaved about 150lbs off for this one.
Dave Callender that's a nice picture of you and your sister.,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Loyda M. Riley Yes!!!!  He IS the biggest snake in the swamp.  He continues to lie and his supporters are so full of hatred and anger towards those who are different and/or have different point of views, that they will swallow all he says without even checking for truth  I always check what either party states because I learned long ago that ANY media and ANY politician can twist words and information around ..... as i've seen this myself......it is just so sad how they are allowing him to treat them like unintelligent children, manipulated for control....feel sorry for them,You socialist communists prove how stupid half of America is
Sherry Carruth it doesn't matter to him....just look at his responses...he's so full of anger and cannot even have an adult conversation or debate.  As for the snowflake, everyone already knows that those who must hold rallies for the sole purpose of whining about people who are mean to them and look for praises and to be coddled by cheers, are the biggest snowflakes of them all.,You socialist communists prove how stupid half of America is
Kelly Dunham Hardin so what is your proposition for all those illegals flying in here?  if you are truly concerned of illegals....why aren't you fighting for the president to stop those coming in with their f1/j1 visas?  you do know those are the ones who take our higher paying jobs, right?  they speak more than one or even two languages,,,,they take high paying jobs from us easily....you think that's right?,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don’t support it. Don’t say we.
he said mexico AND canada are already paying for it through the new deal...it's on his very own twitter page...so why is he holding the government hostage?  oh right, because he's a coward and doesn't know how to negotiate.  he's afraid to let the bill pass onto the senates (which is republican controlled) and have them vote on it  because he's afraid to have a veto under his belt... BTW...Dan....the ones who cross the border to work....they are taxed social security....a tax they can never see as non-citizens....being that we do not have enough social security, they're contribution is helping to keep us afloat on this....use your brain and do some real research like an actual government site....or even a library,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Mike Neary reworking immigration policies is not the same as banning guns...however, adding new walls is most definitely like banning guns, and as you already stated, people will find a way.    There are reasons why certain sections remain open...and obviously we will always have a budget to repair/replace those that are already there.  A more advanced system is what is needed..perhaps even hire more border patrol along these sections.    We have illegals coming in from other means and they eventually take our high paying jobs from Americans.  This is something no one is even discussing.  I've seen this happen myself, and it's far easier by plane.    I don't understand why we cannot have a new system at eh airports where tourists are registered into the system....make sure they have a return flight ticket...make sure they show where they will be staying (hotel reservations helps), monitor college students making sure they do not stay continue to stay once they have graduated,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Ann Shields What did he lie about?,Step down.  Enough of your lies.
Brian Nixon Yes, Nancy and Chuck better wake up and make a deal for the LEGAL TAXPAYING AMERICAN CITIZENS and not for their greedy selves.,We’ll gladly defend them. But we won’t pay $21 billion just to build the damn thing, plus billions per year in maintenance.   The answer is “No”.  Your popularity is dropping pretty quick. You might want to go ahead and accept defeat on this one. That’s what you get for trying to tack regulatory bills onto spending bills.  “No”. - Nancy Pelosi
James Campbell Why? So Chuck and Nancy can turn this country into a socialist/communist country? Wake up and learn some history.,How many shootings are done by American citizens yet you haven't passed many come sense gun laws!
Louis Scherfig Proof of the vulgar left going even lower and proof of the dumbing down of America. Nice language.,I support you... in fucking yourself!
Roy Meston if you can't figure out how raising the minimum wage is going to ruin the economy you need to take an economics class!,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Cathy Bellin tell that to the people who risk their lives every day. They need walls or barriers as well to help them do their jobs more effectively to keep us all safe. Ask any Angel mom.,You better start defending then.  Why are you fixated on the wall?  You do know that border security measures include added personnel, drones and smart tech...why not use those?
IDIOT! You don't have the house votes or even a legit cause to unseat her never mind impeach her.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Trump is a lying crook. If you believe what Trump says you're a SUCKER,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
There are many better ideas. A wall won't stop the tunnels nor will it stop the fentanyl thats flying in fromChina.,We need something!! Build wall.......  Unless someone has a better idea..  Has nothing to do as to if you like Trump or not.. We need wall
Of course we care. But some of us seem better informed and know that fentanyl is flying in from China and that most drugs are intercepted at legal entry points. Trump is lying.,It's a shame you have to do all this for something that  as everyone can see is wrong do they not see the gangs in California or the pictures of the drugs that's caught at the border not just because you in office you the one trying to fix this...it's crazy they want it to stay the same....Do Americans care about America?
He came through a tunnel and he was selling fentanyl that flew in from China.,How did that illegal get here?
Beto knows the truth.,Some people dont want to hear the truth...bet on Beto as one of them...
Not true. 50 people dead so far this year from American citizens shooting each other up. We know what the real emergency is. Most violent crime is not perpetrated by illegal immigrants. Trump just loves to exploit these anecdotal stories when it does happen though.,So much blood on the left and media's hands.  Up to God who they will one day explain it to or not.  I can't judge he reserves that right.  Funny they can't even see the truth. He wins again.
Exactly. Or the 5 shot dead in Illinois yesterday.,How about the parents from Parkland shooting!?!?

Yes,you are right,those that matter appreciate all that you do.

Um, he wasn’t even supposed to be in America in the first place?,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
That is so very sad also.  But that isn't what this message stream is about.  You should start a new post on that one.    Surely you would get support for it.,I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
You need help.,You need help.

BUILD THE WALL!!!,Build that wall. Stand your ground . They all wanted the wall but never did it. They just hate the fact that you will do it!
Beverly Hurst Smith he is working for us while all you heard was the media bashing him. He is and has been building the wall and fixing it already. He has made people work 20 hours to get medicade and EBT and most were dropped because they refused to do even that. Saved tax payers money 😊so much more even, thank you President Trump! 😍,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Steve Deshner Mexico will be paying when the illegals can no longer send American dollars back to Mexico to spend. And we no longer have to pay for illegals medical, food, and housing.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .

Eva Graham just STOP. Please,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Catherine Barbier Blanchard  Actually I would be OK with Trump making every one that doesn’t want the wall pay for it just like Obama did with Obama care!,Why aren’t the taxpayers vote on this issue?? It’s their tax dollars paying for it!! Why not pay the unpaid government workers with the money paid to the crooked politicians??!

Denah Colette Campbell You make no sense at all.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
I will also vote for him again in 2020.  The only person I have ever voted for just for the fact that he is not a political lobbyists pet.  He is doing his job.  Never gets credit for what he has done and accomplished, but gets criticized for every move he makes.  Proud to say he IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.,We elected you to do a job and you are doing that job. I’ll vote for you in 2020 again
He has both republican majority in house and senate and didn’t do a damn thing lol,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
So we are just making stuff up now.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

Danny Jones yeah that’s the Democrat love for you We deal with every day killing everything here in the United States,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Dave Callender Oh that’s real smart it’s not that accident don’t happen to everyone it’s that They had no business being here to cause the accident not having insurance because they are illegal you’re real smart,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Kris Landers that’s just stupid a person that’s not supposed to be in this country it is called a illegal alien that person should not be here to be able to drink to kill a person seems to me you’re not very smart actually the store owners fault also if she did not have a legal ID the store owner should be prosecuted and lose their liquor license to and get a fine but come onHopefully you don’t have that many rocks rolling around in your head,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.

Norene Boone  love my President WE HAVE ONE SINGLE MAN who has attempted to solve a problem that predated him being in the White House. We have one single man who fights every day for Americans against all the elite, deep state Washington insiders owned by lobbyists! Thank you President Trump,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Fay Johnson for sure. Well God would never listen to a prayer like that.,Mike Holub so sad you saying something like that

Suiter Kaye oh I read yesterday that Elon Musk helped Flint. Musk 2020,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that’s where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don’t see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That’s unacceptable.  Anyway, I’m done discussing it.  If 🇷🇺 doesn’t interfere,  😉 I’m sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
Angela Wilson is that all, you just made America feel like heaven, the way you criticized those European countries, your police force kills their own children, I mean if they see blacks as theirs, i don't hear stories like that in others countries,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.

Praying that Brexit is finalized this year.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Gary Kane   A little chaos is good every now and then. Trump believes in getting things done. For years we have had a lot of talk and very little action. How can anyone say it’s trump’s fault when Pelosi won’t even meet and slams the door before even talking?  What I want to know is why Democrats don’t go around her and negotiate.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Arturo Elroy Mañana   They most certainly won't hurt. Gives boarder patrol a bit of an advantage.  Please listen to those that face it everyday.  They know best.,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak. Did you not listen.... he is giving them 90% of what they want!!!!,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Emily Neal Americans will never go for it. They are smart enough to know that only the law abiding will turn in guns, leaving them completely defenseless against criminals.,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
Estefania Torres Restrepo A Wall will keep out hundreds of illegals. Then more attention can be given at legal ports of entry to stop drugs flowing into the country. More people could be after the over stayed visa people.,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Dedrick Jordan   Seek help.,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.
Lisa Mann A Wall will make it much more difficult and time consuming than just walking in.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
Lori Olson Rasmann American taxpayers have paid for border walls in 3 other countries. What you should be thinking is why the democrats don’t want a wall. They don’t want it not because it won’t work but because it will, and they know it.,Nikki Graham How do you know this? Did you read the bill? Who is your source?
Nora Arevalo it is rather difficult to hand dig a tunnel. Have you considered that?  Have you thought about how long it would take. Do you think or just spout Democratic talking points?,Mr President have you heard of Tunnels.
That would have been Osama when he held office.,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
He sits on his fat arse tweeting all the time.,That camera angle does a decent job of hiding Trump's obesity.
And 4 Americans were killed because he said that. ISIS was sending trump a message that they are not defeated! Trump wont listen to the people he should be listening too. Mattis tried to tell him and trump thinks he knows more than the Generals. NOT ! Trump thinks he knows more about everything than anyone. Typical Narcissist!,How many shootings are done by American citizens yet you haven't passed many come sense gun laws!
Maybe you should talk about trump and his orange hair, his fake tan and his lack of intelligence !,All americans. Thank you Sheldon. Trump is the President America needs to keep America safe and great!
You are a friggin idiot !,GO PRESIDENT TRUMP BUILD THE WALL IF THE DEMS HAVA A PROBLEM THEY CAN MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY
Draining the swamp?? lol. He keeps filling it with sewage water and then either fires them or they resign. Then he replaces them with more sewage !!!,Shelly Burgess learn.  🛑 👽 a 🐑
,Im sure he did.
Im sure he did.,Wendi DelValle liar.
I guess someone in his circle can start it.... I’m ready,I guess someone in his circle can start it.... I’m ready
Davita Levao.. Who are you to judge? That's Gods Job..Not Yours. I know you cannot Walk on Water. Shame on You!!,And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.             Thank you Jesus for Trump and Pence.

Omar Martinez https://abcnews.go.com/US/largest-single-group-migrants-tunnels-border-wall-arizona/story?id=60462672,I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can’t fool everyone. Open the government !

Sherry Carruth President Trump is trying to do all he promised but the demos will not stop oh, who cares who pays for it us taxpayers pay for every other damn corrupt thing in this country, so I say if we have to pay for something this wall would be a nice change.

Norene Boone I pay 740. A month and only  pays for half my medical bills no scripts no dental no vision .this needs to stop.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Stephanie Kay Shockley you are not losing your home in 30 days.get real,Renee Martinez But people are dying and suffering because of the government shutdown. I'll keep praying asking God to get him to do what's right.

Patti Cullen, picking on the wrong President for that. Obama was definitely the one that thought that.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.
Jeanie Railsback, I lost my husband too, and he also died here at home. He was a Veteran from Vietnam era and evidently the VA got his records mixed up with someone that served in Afghanistan. He didn't believe me when I told him that I didn't think that the VA Hospital was really trying to help him until about a month or so before he passed away. We didn't have insurance either because we couldn't afford it and be able to live day to day.    To many foreign doctors working there with their own agendas. I don't believe that they have the lives of our Veterans and their families as top priority for surviving.    The Democrats always thought that the WALL should be built until Trump promised to see that one actually would be built. I think that a feasiblity study should have been done as to what the WALL should be built out of etcetera and how to use technology to help with patrolling and monitoring the border before doing a slapdash project.,Well,,my husband died from poor medical treatment...no walk was gonna give me good health insurance.

Danny Jones you need to go educate yourself, and have all the facts checked! Please!,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
I won't deny the fact that America has a gun problem, though we can't act like illegal immigration isn't an issue.  While not every immigrant is a threat to society, we cannot deny the fact some of them are, even if they're a minority. Some are even wanted criminals.  Not to mention that if Orange-man were to actually implement stricter firearm control, there would still be a lot of contraband crossing the border because of the lack of immigration control. Not just drugs, but unlicensed weapons as well.  They're basically fuel for the black market which puts unlicensed weapons in the wrong hands. this in itself is valid reason to encourage possession of a firearm to protect one's self against this threat.  I think that fixing (or at least minimizing) the contraband problem is the first step towards implementing a better, more efficient gun control project since the population will feel more secure.  Whether building a wall is the best solution is up for debate. On the surface it looks extreme, but we won't know its efficiency until it's finalized. Until then, people will have a valid argument to defend both the second amendment and the wall. Pierre-Luc Vachon,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans
That I can agree on. I guess I misinterpreted your first post and I apologize for the misunderstanding.   Though we might not agree on everything, I respect your views and knowing you're a future politician, I'll give you this advice to help you on your path.  The ironic tone of your comment made it sound like you were making a statement on the president's priorities instead of him pushing propaganda. Some might have understood your position, but I think your comment is open to a lot of misinterpretations.  Nothing's wrong with irony or humor of course, though clearly stating your position is a must in this day and age (especially considering everyone takes everything as an attack nowadays). Hope this can be of some help for your future career. :3,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans

Mike Sikora yeah! You're comments are devoid of both truth and facts!,Democrats are so hell bent on trying to make Trump fail but what are they doing in return to make this country better? Right now, absolutely nothing. Don't blame Trump for the shutdown. Blame the House for not passing a bill that will not pass the Senate.  Turnabout is fair play. The democrats refused to make the necessary votes to pass a bill that the House (when republicans had the House) and now the Senate republicans are saying "No". Kinda sucks when the other teams is using your playbook against you.

Joseph Roy start with Americans first tho. That's where Trump should start,I would suggest that you deal with the ones you have at home first then.
Build A northern border wall too BOOM!,What about all the middle eastern illegals pouring across the Canadian border? This is more of a problem than those coming in across Mexico’s border!!!!
Barbara Davis That would be awesome!,I would love to see a "fireside chat" on TV, with only the American people. No press, no Congress and definitely no papers sent to Pelosi ahead of time.
Dario Sanchez Just you keep your head in that dark place that's between your legs!,I completely feel like you have NO IDEA on what you're doing anymore.
Jeri Hendren Guess you never went on strike on a company you work for. Like 92days!,So has the democrats even suggested anything on what can actually be done to HELP security on  the borders. For some reason haven't heard anything on that
Jim MacKey believe nothing you hear and only half of what you see!,Jocke Stangebye  I never pictured Stanley as a wanker...but now that you mention it...
Joshua Yang Thanks To President Trump, the Asian workers have the highest job rating EVER!,Nadine Weber no threat there just people travelling to and from work. I spent the last three years traveling around that area for work when I lived in Merced California.

Thanks to President Trump!,All you who voted for him look like you all keep it in the family if you know what I'm incesting,  I mean intending 🤣🤣🤣  No wonder your brain cells seem to be deteriorating at an amazing speed.

Slow your roll cuck. Don't cry yourself to sleep. You have 6 more years.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Bobby Wilson maybe the Dems who originally voted FOR the wall should stop pretending to be against it,Then open up the Government so TSA workers get paid
Blaine Tundler yes they are,No other country has open borders why should we
Abdul Majid she is a legal immigrant,What about melina trump she is also immigrant
Ok ppl are getting paranoid here,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Charles Landry this is not proof of need for a wall. Illegal immigration happens primarily through Visa overstays and the other issues we have with border security are also largely through ports of entry. This is intended to bolster unthinking response by people who have poor critical thinking skills. It is transparent fear mongering.,Who exactly??? Because stats don't support a barrier wall.

Ruben Radar Rodriguez    Drusilla Morrison read this post please.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?

Angela Harris I agree,  and I see it all the time with our schools,You can get arrested for hunting and fishing without a license, why are the illegals allowed to work and stay in America without being cleared. And schools that are run by tax payer money should have to verify that the parents of enrolling children are here legally. You would be shocked how many children are entering our schools.
Same as Obama making us pay for everyone’s insurance.,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.

Yes, people can tunnel and OCCASIONALLY do, but Nancy’s electronic dogs are not the answer.,I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.

These people should not be in office. They are acting so childish and petty. I say we get rid of them and replace with more reasonable people!
Mike V. Radatti more Americans are killed by fellow Americans with guns than anything else including drugs from over the Mexican border and illegals put together,An American just murdered 5 Americans and this is his focus 🤦🏻‍♀️
the art of the deal LOL trump cant get a deal but you think he's a clever cunning man LMAO only morons and idiots read trumps book,The art of the deal is being played out and its obvious Pelosi didn't read the book lol.How can people of this country not see how Pelosi doesn't care about her own state all she cares about is attacking Potus.
waiting 2 years to declare an emergency is hardly addressing an emergency if he waited until after he didnt get his own way to call it , he just needs to keep his base happy so he gets a second term,WHY is declaring a National Emergency to address a National Emergency in The United States considered wrong? There are 28 current National Emergencies, most of which involve “emergencies” in OTHER countries, that were declared by the previous POTUS.     ALL of these so-called declared National Emergencies could be applied to the actions of those people who are ILLEGALLY crossing the Southern Border of the United States of America.   IF apprehensions are down, it is ONLY because of a concerted effort to deter entry, that DETERMENT costs the taxpayer, BILLIONS of dollars each year. The press likes to declare that most drug apprehensions are at legal crossings which is true; however, how do we know how many drugs are successfully transported across our unsecured border every day?      A wall is a realistic, and economic, approach to denying illegal entry into this country.  Why do you think walls there are built around prisons, the Vatican, Israel, "homes of the rich and famous” and most other countries.  BECAUSE the expense of employing many guards with guns to protect 2000 miles of border is TOO expensive and NOT nearly as effective as a wall!    "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers"  report put the total cost of illegal immigration at $135 billion a year, while claiming undocumented immigrants paid only $19 billion a year in taxes. That leaves a net loss to local, state and federal governments of $116 billion a year." (* 2017, FAIR's)  This does not include cost of loss of life, property, and Democratic stability.
trump shut it down , if they give him his pointless wall he'll shut it down every time he does not get his own way . he's a man child having a tantrum,i wish the dems would stop stalling go ahead and give the man his wall least trump is standing for something   this is a disgrace  l
exactly what the DEMOCRATS have bee saying FIX THE SYSTEM not build a wall,How does one have a criminal past but not be deported if they did not have legal documents to stay here? This is more then just a wall. The justice system sucks and needs fixing.
trump is USING them to further his agenda he couldnt give a crap about them,Are Pelosi, Schumer others in Congress so cold hearted that they can't feel this pain of lives shattered?
we don't , we just know spending $25 BILLION on a wall will  NOT stop people entering the country illegally ,  most illegals are visa over stayers but trump is not addressing that he just wants a wall to keep votes off morons like you two,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(

STOP listening to bias propaganda, it make your debate ridulious.

Raphael Pulman  This is very insightful about the European Union (EU) government.  """ Dear Mr. Temple, Thank you for your supportive email. The EU president was not elected into his post and is meant to be the face of 450 million people in Europe.  There is no mechanism to remove him and no way, through the ballot box, that the people of Europe can hold him to account.  The European Union is a undemocratic and corrupt organisation that tries to force us to accept one EU currency, one EU flag and one EU state without the consent of the people. It is my job to fight against this and be the voice of free speech - again thank you for your kind message. Yours sincerely, Nigel Farage" """,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.

The Emoluments Clause, US Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 “Also known as the Title of Nobility Clause, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution prohibits any person holding a government office from accepting any present, emolument, office, or title from any "King, Prince, or foreign State," without congressional consent. This clause is meant to prevent external influence and corruption of American officers by foreign States. A similar provision was included in the Articles of Confederation, applicable to both federal and state officers. The language of the modern clause, however, suggests that only federal government officials are prohibited from accepting any emoluments. That the phrase "Offices of Profit or Trust under the United States" applies to all appointed officials is undisputed, however there is much debate as to whether it extends to elected officials. History does not provide a clear answer: When he served as Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton produced a list of persons holding such offices at the request of the Senate; the list did not include any elected positions. Further, during their presidencies, while George Washington did not seek or obtain congressional consent for foreign gifts, Andrew Jackson did. The Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act of 1966, on the other hand, enumerates several elected positions in its definition of "employees" who may not accept any gift of more than minimal value without congressional approval. Such "employees" include the President and the Vice President, a Member of Congress, and the spouses and dependents of the same. A constitutional amendment was introduced in 1810 to modify the Emoluments Clause. The effect would have been to strip the citizenship of any U.S. citizen who accepted, claimed, received, or retained any title of nobility from a foreign government. However, this amendment was never ratified, though it is technically still pending before the states. The interpretation of the Emoluments Clause has never been litigated before the U.S. Supreme Court.” https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/emoluments_clause,What part of "trump and his supporters" did you not understand?

Hayden Blair sueing is just going to tie up the funds I didn't say he wouldn't get the money.

Norene Boone are you going to really compare Trump to Obama? You can’t seriously believe the Republicans hated Obama more than the Democrats loathe Trump. It’s not even close...and you know it.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

It’s sad to say he is using it as much as the other side as his 2020 campaign initiative / slogan etc. Sad state of affairs.,Why was this not done with in the last two years??? 🤔 When Mexico refused to pay for it , President Trump and Republicans held the House and the Senate for two years.! Why didn't they push the wall through??? Why?
Eva Graham , after we impeach Drumpf for treason!,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.

Alberto Weisz And use other means?,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Angel Roy Was it 6 ft tall..,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
Buck Strunk Sigh...Do you have open borders right now?,No other country has open borders why should we
Joyce Ames He has a good point..Where are Trumps words for the 5 Americans gunned down yesterday...49 days in 2019 and 39 mass shootings!Not one of them done by an illegal..,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall.

You have never lived in a border state! Like the Dems- all talk- no facts.,Borders are fine.

This Man we call our President, has suffered more from people like you than any President of the United States of American ever should...   We do Love him and we love the fact he is going the job no other has ever done before.  We Will Stand together or Fall.  This is for U, President Donald J. Trump.  Amen,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
and would love to meet my girls Diamond and Silk,It always astounds me so many US people actually like this man....he’s the laughing joke all over the world...
Noble Loria I'm so afraid that you are right on this one.,Trump start out by saying let’s build a wall. Are you a Trump supporters cheered him on. Now Trump is saying let’s finish the wall. Again all you Trump supporters are cheering him on.   He hasn’t even started to build the wall. But now you guys are cheering him on to finish it.  All Trump has to do is say he finish the wall.  You Trump supporters walk again cheer him on.  So why doesn’t he just do that.  All this nonsense will be over.
He is the president of the USA. If a wall is a national emergency than so is Flint.  Everybody is so democratic & so republican that no one looks at the big picture.   The U. S coast guard is working without pay!   Y’all assume that everyone that disagrees with you is a democrat. Trumpster logic.   If I wasn’t a democrat before best believe I’ll be voting blue in 2020.  Regardless of your political leanings Trump is one of the worst things to happen to this country in a loooooong time.,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that’s where the threat is?   If he loves the country so much why not invest in Flint, Michigan?  The man is a  liar.  I mean I thought he said Mexico was paying for the wall. What happened to that?  He said he release his tax returns if he won.  He said there were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.  I mean to think that a former reality tv star, who comes across as a narcissistic , and has had many a failed business venture.   To believe that man over  journalists, historians, scientists & really anybody with a sliver a decency.   I don’t see how anybody who supports Trump could consider themselves a real American.   He has Americans working for free. That’s unacceptable.  Anyway, I’m done discussing it.  If 🇷🇺 doesn’t interfere,  😉 I’m sure the majority of the American people will vote differently in 2020.  You have a good night.
lol if you think that’s a mic drop. I’ll let you have it.   I’m more concerned with why we have a president who thinks a wall is of the utmost importance when his own press secretary has admitted that threat is entering by airport & why people are working & not being paid.,if he cares about the country so much Why not invest that money in more airport security since his press secretary admitted that’s where the threat is?

Lisa Mann no.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?

Sarah Elizabeth Nope, there were too many poli-ticks in the republican party too.  Reps and Sens swear an oath to negotiate for their constituents needs, in good faith, to determine national policy.  It is clear they have all been playing a kid's 'Man-O-War' game for over 30 years.  We need leadership not posturing!,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Charlie Daboub If he used exec powers it be in the courts for another 30 years.  I've wondered on several 'situations' and if our legislatures were only half doing their jobs we would all be better off.

at least you admit you are from another country, many comments on here do not admit it.,Eric Wroblewski thank you
We need to put the money where your heart is . Here in America❤,Wasn't Mexico supposed to pay for the wall
Joseph Nowik  Juarez mexico is one of the most dangerous cities look it up . Its behind our border and if them walls are not fully secure or they come down thier dangerous city will be part of our country because they can walk over . Think about that ! Think about your family to be safe.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Larry Burford what does that have to do with this . So you want more killing to enter the US while we have enouph of our own . Juarez mexico is on the list of the most dangerous cities behind our border . You are really thinking crazy ! The border isnt even secure there either . If the walls come down they become part of our country . Think about that . They can walk right over .,More Americans with guns kill Americans than immigrants your gun laws needs to be sorted first
Dennis Coughlan sssssshhhhhh,How are democrats stopping you from building a wall you said Mexico would pay for? Is it because you lied and are now trying to stick American tax payers with the $25 billion dollar wall. Your stupid wall idea only covers a small percentage of the country and does absolutely nothing to stop the 40% of immigrants that fly in. Your $25 billion dollar wall will do nothing to stop illegal immigration. Why dont you just be honest and admit you know how to embezel and extort a ton of money from this wall project.
Adria Jackson absolutely blatant!!! Everything they do is because they hate trump. It’s not for the American people.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you

Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.

Saige Turner You don't have a clue do you.  Those coming across the border and working are being paid in cash which they send home to their familys.  I've seen it happen many times.  They pay NO social security.  They don't even have legal Social Security cards.  Idiot!!!,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.

At what point are our resources so taxed you say enough? How many legal citizens have to die before saying enough? Let the ammo fly at the border and see how long it takes for other countries to realize we aren't joking about stopping the flow of illegals... use them drones and sensors to give plenty of advanced warning to those that would still dare to try.. how would you personally fix this? Any ideas or just more bitching cause your candidate lost...,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Okay Stephen. According to the way we elect presidents in the United states, we elected a president. This president's name is Trump. I don't care who or who doesn't like him. We, the United states of America, have a president. The people, according to years of tradition, have elected Trump as that president. Work harder at getting a viable democratic president.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
Stephen Pierson how do you know the majority? Did we take it to a vote? ..... oh that's right..... we did.... we elected a president who put that as his campaign promise.... I see both sides and have friends in both sides.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
James Boose right...... lol and the dems didn't have any resources to do the same thing! In fact that is why Hillary was so shocked! 🤣,NOW THIS:  BREAKING: Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, says he paid a tech firm to rig online polls before the 2016 presidential campaign got underway "at the direction of and the sole benefit of" Donald Trump.

Phylis Ledesma get back to me when you graduate from high school.   Trump loves uneducated people like you.   Too stupid to check the actual facts.   Just chant along like a kindergartner.,Jim Towery you are truly misinformed.   The government contracts out for many specialized services.  Those folks will not get any “back pay”.    Ignorance is the #1 quality of trump supporters.

I signed!!,Joyce Van Kirk sign
Lol! Yeah, sure and Trump doesn't? OMG!,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Thank you Albert, you are a smart man! I like him too!!! Great President!!!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Cally Schneider no not really I see lots of people listing accomplishments of the President and actually the whole post is about him trying to stop illegal immigration,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Kris Landers What an idiot u r,Sad things happen all the time. You could just as well blame the shopkeeper for selling the beer. The place or person that sold him the truck. To focus on citizenship as a reason this happened is very petty.
no she doesn't love trump the fat baby man,#WALKAWAY
Chris McCarthy There is NO crisis at the Border.  It's been proven.  He said on TV that he will #trumpshutdown the government and take credit for it.  Did he lie to YOU when he claimed Mexico would pay for the wall?  100%  ---  There has been deals...deals that he refuses to sign.  Deals he refuses to sign because of right wing media.  He is getting most of the blame for this shutdown.  And rightly so.,I'm impressed President Trump that you haven't called a national emergency yet.. When will the Demos wake the F up. Stay strong President Trump
Cinda Beinert  he’s protecting ignorant people like you I got bills to pay 💰 and am working for free ok enough with the fucking bullshit and tell your president to pay me my money,John Baron the pay is indirect- and he has kept more campaign promises than any other politician in my lifetime
Michael Fuerst apparently you are against a wall. What do you propose we do for our country’s safety?,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Buck Strunk This was not your country, read the history, how you got here and made this land your own.  All the whites were illegals, experienced in torturing, tormenting and butchering the Native Americans.,No other country has open borders why should we
No fraud. He's trying to enforce our Constitution and laws. Something the Democrats spit upon now!,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Retha Ricketts idiot, those are not Obama's words, but Liar in Chief's!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
https://www.theroot.com/10-things-they-wont-tell-you-about-the-border-wall-1831558139,Eric Wroblewski thank you
As soon as the Dems took the house, he called it an Emergency  ..lol  The house and the senate agreed on a budget  deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!   The Trump administration tried to dismantle DACA, that shields approximately 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation, in the fall of 2017, but a prolonged court battle has kept the initiative alive. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also announced the eventual termination of TPS protections for more than 250,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Honduras, Sudan and Haiti, but a federal judge blocked the decision in early October.  Now he says he’ll give a temporary stay for them, something he took away.. for his 5.7 none border he PROMISED and GARENTEEED ! Mexico would pay for... lol … yes more barriers where immigration says it needs, not 5.7 billion for his dumb wall, MAJOIRTY of drugs come in cars at ports of entry, FACT!,The best ever president.. #Trump2020..🙌🙌🙌.
FACT: Majority of Americans blame trump for shutdown, he even said it was him on TV, trump had majority of the house and senate, did nothing for 2 yrs., but give himself a huge tax cut, As soon as the Dems took the house, he called it an Emergency  ..lol  The house and the senate agreed on a budget  deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!   Now he says hill give the same thing he took away, 2 yrs ago, DACA & TPS  offering temporary protection from deportations for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall funding for 5.7, for his NONE WALL he promised Mexico would pay for...lol ( not a compromise ) and makes up a crises, Majority of drugs come at ports of entry FACT!,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Anthony Clark the entire city is run by democrats that’s what happens🤷‍♂️  Also the water crisis ended April of last year,Why isn’t mexico paying for it? 😂😂😂 damn y’all dumb 😂😂
Tess Calomino add closer,Eddie Sturgis scared of the success .. your party better grasp what is happening to the heartland and entire running of our nation.
Don't you need passport to visit other countries,No other country has open borders why should we
Melody Hutchison Really and what type of Pres do you think Obama was. Trump hasn't cut off benefits for those who need it. Medicare and Medicaid both received Raises and so did SS and SSI.,He's not ever going to change.  I'm not ever going to forgive his cowardice cutting off benefits for the people who really need it. I'm a 49 year old who has had back surgery and I'm going to have to have neck surgery soon. I can't ever hold a job cause I can't sit down or walk very much.  He's the worst president ever including all the republicans.
Elizabeth Burton Steere Vanity Wall ?How about u ask border agents what they think ??,Elizabeth Burton Steere Vanity Wall ?How about u ask border agents what they think ??
It's both parties,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
George Mendes what the hell ever-so do I and anyone with half a brain sees the devastation of the drugs that come in, or the communities turning into barrio shitholes full of illegals! Get the hell out with that bullshit!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  The ball is in Pelosi hands now. Let’s see if she’ll come back with a counter offer to Trumps offer. ...Nope. No counter offer. Democrats don’t want to negotiate. They leave town. NOBODY in Congress should leave town until they hash this out so people can get back to work and get paid. The wall is for border security. We must have. The shutdown is democrats now. Putting politics before people.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Jim Cavo Gaff theres 33million undocumented illegals you and I support, and not by choice!,To those liberals who say a couple thousand illegals crossing is not bad, how many would you consider a problem? 10,000? 100,000?  1 for me is too much, are you personally going to sponsor any of them?  I bet NO, why is that?
Addy Means Elizabeth Warren gave hers up! To a refugee/ asylum seeker foundation but she did give it up. SMH Right after she said Trump's shut down is keeping 800,000 Americans from being paid so I am donating my paycheck to illegals! OK how does that help Americans not getting paid??  They have lost their minds, or they have never really been heard before.,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Shirley Terry Harrow power and greed are evil things.,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Angela Maria how will the wall fail to stop illegals. Yes, a few will get through, but right now, you can just walk up to an imaginary line and toss your unwanted child into another country.  OUR children and young women are also taken across that line and sold into slavery. So, tell us, oh wise one, why the wall won't stop people?  Do the walls in your house not reduce your access to entries and exits?,I feel terrible for these families and I also feel terrible for families that lost their children just because they went to school...there is a gun crisis in this country and that needs addressing...the wall wont do anything to prevent illegals, get real
Cindy Cripps-Prawak Nancy could end this, but she has some important stuff to do first. Just think about that a minute,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Gary Kane you mean the two wasted years spent looking for Boris Badinoff, Natasha, and their influence on my vote? Two YEARS we have been paying for that. What did we get for our money? Nothing. Have you even thought about the cost of this "ghost hunt" for invisible forces?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Maureen Ryan Two years you people have been chasing the Russians. So, tell me, WHAT did the Russians do to influence your vote? Did you see something that we missed?  Tell us, what EXACTLY are you looking for? The FBI can't find it, the CIA can't either, Pelosi can't say what it is, neither can MSM. What are you looking for? Please tell.,Let's see how many lies can be told in 8 minutes! Everyone should FACT CHECK this idiot when he's done. Oh and Manadort conspiring with the Russians....imagine that as idiots campaign chair ...again imagine that!!!  Maybe idiot should build a wall around himself...oh wait the WALLS r closing in on him.
Shelly Newton how do we start a GoFundMe? I would donate in a minute!!!,I guess someone in his circle can start it.... I’m ready
Albert J Destefanis I prefer to think of it more as sewer than a swamp. Sewage goes out a Democrat and after going through the sewage treatment plant comes back a Republican.,Trump is right. Impeach Pelosi for sedition.

Curtis Rice what a dumbass un-american response. We just need to get rid of jerks like you.,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.

Mar Reese  I know that’s sad ... I m all for keeping our country safe build the wall,America first because it's the right thing to do.Best President ever.🇺🇸💪🇺🇸
Foreign interference like illegal invaders voting?,How many shootings are done by American citizens yet you haven't passed many come sense gun laws!
Renieri Ortiz there is a huge difference between a legal immigrant and an illegal immigrant.,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.
Marc Blair but you know what else doesn't work either?,If the border wall would work I'd be all for it. But it doesn't. It won't.
Your brain needs to be removed it’s  A fraud,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm a huge Trump supporter but he made it appear that he had closed the deal on the wall.  Instead he comes out with this whimpy proposal lol,I'm a huge Trump supporter but he made it appear that he had closed the deal on the wall.  Instead he comes out with this whimpy proposal lol

Barbara Stockwell, The Dems just took control of the House. The Republicans had all 3 branches for 2 years. If it really was an emergency don't you think they would have passed A bill for the wall?,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1155510014605234&id=227505360917068
Kris Knight, That's funny as hell.,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Alison Edwards Lorentz DACA recipients won't pay $5,000 most of them don't have $5,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin you don’t support it. Don’t say we.
Islam is taking over the democratic party,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Erika Rhone it was not their money. Carter gave it back to them as ransom for the Americans Iran held hostage. He gave it back during the last hours of his administration.,Sue Howie stay in New Zealand and stay out of American politics funny how foriegners want a say in our President fu
MJ  Stark or was not their money. That money was given back to them as ransom for the Americans Iran held hostage for 444 days. Carter gave it back in the last hours of his administration.,Sue Howie stay in New Zealand and stay out of American politics funny how foriegners want a say in our President fu
Mike J Knifong this is not a lie and believing anything snopes says is a joke. Snopes is notorious for its lies. They are a liberal site and will always call truth lies  When the owner was asked how they get their information he could not answer. That money was not Iran's. That money was given back to them as ransom when Iran held American's hostage for 444 days. Carter released that money in the final hours of his administration.  Fact. Snopes is a joke and couldn't tell the truth if their life depended on it. Obummer used taxpayer dollars to give to a terrorist nation that hates America.  He did it without congressional approval in the dead of night and with pallets of cash.,Sue Howie stay in New Zealand and stay out of American politics funny how foriegners want a say in our President fu
How many lives will be saved!!!! My baby brother died from that junk they are bringing in.,How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.
Not gonna happen, for the libs 😆, 2020 TRUMP✔,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

Pamela Evans Wahler  I totally agree!  Dems were on board under Obama....What’s changed....They just don’t want another Campaign promise fulfilled by Trump.,Agree.  Was just at the border to drop off family at PCT start. And it was crazy to see the wall there in person.  Down by Campo CA.  We need the Border protected. Thank you for fighting the good fight for all of us that agree with you.
Charlesetta Brown they are more than welcome IF they come in legally.  The problem is, the ones that don't come legally.  They have no right to be here period.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Dawn Duff what is pointless is spending over 100 billion dollars a year of taxpayer money on people that have no legal right to be here.  Why aren't you crying about sending billions of OUR tax dollars to Jordan to build THEIR pointless wall?,More people are killed by American citizens than immigrants,the wall is pointless
Nancy Harris are you also complaining about the billions of taxpayer dollars sent to Jordan to build THEIR wall?,I just do NOT understand they level of insanity in people that think this is not necessary
Dylan Shaw so how many come in undetected?  No way to get accurate numbers.,20% of illegal immigration comes in through Mexico, and a wall won't stop half of that.  Logical legislation is need, not a stupid wall.
Estefania Torres Restrepo so how does anyone accurately determine how many people or the amount of drugs have came into the US undetected?  That's right, you can't.  The argument of most/majority and legal ports of entry is just guesswork trying to be passed off as fact. A wall is a deterrent, along with the increased border enhancements.  They go hand in hand in preventing the illegal crossing of the border.  Come in legally, they are more than welcome.  Come in  illegally, no.   Opinions are not facts.,You’re disgusting for using the death of someone for political gain
Joan Hamilton it doesn't matter why he was illegal.  The fact that he had no legal right to be here is enough!,Sympathies to the family but the odds of her being killed by a mass shooter in school, or by a drunk American are statistically higher than what happened here.   The courts failed long before he got to her.   There is nothing in these articles that say why he was illegal, just that he was suspected of being illegal.  Did he overstay a visa?  Is he a DACA kid?    Too many unknowns.
Joseph Tewell so how's your tax dollars that are being sent to Jordan to build THEIR wall helping you?,Ya my tax dollars going for a wall thats not going to stop them
Lee Mcclelland so we shouldn't have a wall to make it easier for them?,Because a person willing to kill people is going to look at a wall and say “oops, look at that ... getting past this would be illegal, I should stop here.”
Noble Loria so according to your logic, the live Facebook streams of the past week or so, at the border where the area is going from wide open area to an area that has a wall is fake?  Ohhhhhhkay.,Trump start out by saying let’s build a wall. Are you a Trump supporters cheered him on. Now Trump is saying let’s finish the wall. Again all you Trump supporters are cheering him on.   He hasn’t even started to build the wall. But now you guys are cheering him on to finish it.  All Trump has to do is say he finish the wall.  You Trump supporters walk again cheer him on.  So why doesn’t he just do that.  All this nonsense will be over.
Paul Karachia if we didn't have to spend over 100 billion every year on illegals, more could be spent to help the citizens! Walls don't work?  If you come to a wall you have 4 choices... Go over it, go under it, go around it, go back the same way you came.  Anything is better than nothing! Slow them down so border patrol can get there to apprehend.,Mr president wall don't work , that's a waste of funds, take care of the veterans. This way you will always be great.
Pierre-Luc Vachon how's that gun control working out in Chicago?  Crime is UP since they started it there.,Marianne Duboy but he wont talk about the fact thats hundreds of americans are killing thousands of americans every year because there is no gun control. aaaah those americans
Flint was given millions of dollars by Obama, if it's not fixed that's on Flints government.,So what makes you think a damn wall will keep out illegals?
Wayne David say it louder for those in the back!!,Any crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that could have been avoided if our borders were secure and our immigration laws were enforced.
John Bentley Stop using this old joke! 🤣🤣🤣😭😭,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises.

Larry Lubiner it's already happening... might as well get on this Trump train ole son TRUMP 2020 because you aren't going to have any Democrap presidents for the next 100 years,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Ruth Mosley Poor baby hillary lost,You’ve posted this meme 57 times already. Chill out grandpa.

Poor baby hillary lost,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!
Poor baby hillary lost,Terry Clark what's Hillary got to do with anything. That shipped sailed long ago. You guys need a new tune....lol
What if.   What if.     That is so stupid.   What if you're momma swallowed,You want to blame immigrants 🤔💭  🚨Rally me this 🚨 what if trumps grandfather 👴 were the immigrant who killed his daughter   Is that the solution for an unnecessary wall❓❓❓  We have more shootings of backyard corn bread 🥖 American’s killing more than any other race in the United States 🇺🇸   🚨The statistics are proof🚨  You can’t blame one immigrant When last year alone you have 50-1  50-Americans  1- immigrant  Responsible for the murders of innocent people ‼️  🚨We have a Gun problem 🚨 Not an immigrant issue ‼️🤨☝🏼
A wall is to save our sovereign state from foreign countries  or terrorist.   Dumbass,So it's a wall making the US a nation? Thought that would be true for China....
Justin Fields,  Which part of making America great do you hate?,Best president ever! #maga
Gary Kane 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Then move idiot,Terry Keene I left looong time ago ;)  because Europe is better than where you live ;)
Even having the money that has been confiscated doesn't automatically allocate it to that particular budget funding. It must still be approved by congress no matter where the money comes from. Doesn't haven't to be the specific taxpayer money, how much did Obama send Iran again? Oh yeah, it was billions as well of our taxpayer money. As a government employee household of 35 years I can assure you first hand the government wastes far more than that just in idle hand-wrenching and not making a decision? Why didn't they fix this crap when they had control for so many years exactly? Do you know? They don't want to for their own agenda's and now more than ever simply because of stupid blind hate of Trump for no real actual reason any worse than anything any other president has ever done in their lifetime. Kennedy was a womanizer if that's your beef and everyone knew it, but overlooked it. Character issues, let's don't trot out all of Bill's as we just don't have that much time left in this world now do we. Please, get an actual real reason to not want better border security, a better economy for all, left and right sides, beside the lame and whimpy "I just can't stand Trump" and would rather see our country go down in flames than agree with him. How very childish.,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Syddonney Successful Raymond . Hmmm when I get laid off @ my job I don't get back pay when recalled. If you are working and not getting paid I applaud you and sympathize with you. I hope this gets settled soon.,John Baron the pay is indirect- and he has kept more campaign promises than any other politician in my lifetime
Hes just concerned about vengeful lobsters,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Jennifer Myers very untrue,thanks for saving the country
Cindy Bock dumbasses,18 people (here) posted a hate emoji to defending our nation. Wonder who they are!
Carl Ostendarp duh its just a comment.   It's won't happen of course, but its not right for federal employees to go without and all the politicians have no worry in the world financially, which is why they won't  budge. It doesn't directly affect them,Todd Schroeder shame on you

This is quite literally untrue.,No other country has open borders why should we
They’re getting paid because of Donald Trump’s signature. Also, your GOP members of Congress are getting paid as well, you dumb motherfucker,Border patrol and customs, TSA, and Coast Guard  non essential Federal employees all not fully staffed.  How is that protecting our  borders again? Asking for a friend.
Remember the last terrorist attack here? Know how they arrived? Through customs via legal ports-of-entry. The last one before that was by two white dudes that were American citizens. Terrorists and drug dealers aren’t sneaking across the southern border through tunnels. They aren’t that stupid.,Sheldon Satchel thank you!!!
No they aren’t. He quite literally said that he would be proud to shut it down and would take credit for it. Try again,Do your job and open the government and stop holding  them hostage
Ooh, using “gay” as an insult. The 1980s think you’re awesome.,issue? like what?
The irony is here so rich that I may require an AED,impeach pelosi and schumer for malfeasance and obstruction
We wouldn’t have a leader working for a hostil power to start,I can't even imagine what our nation would have been like under Clinton!  So grateful for President Trump!

Edgar D. GutierrezTexas is the only state to track crime specifically among illegal immigrants let's use them as an example:  Between January 2011- January 2019 there have been 10 school shootings in the state of Texas. Of those 10 shootings 15 people have died and 28 have been injured.   Now let's look at crime amongst illegal immigrants in Texas. "Between June 1, 2011 and January 31, 2019, 189,000 illegal aliens were charged with more than 295,000 criminal offenses. DPS criminal history records reflect those criminal charges have thus far resulted in over 120,000 convictions including 238 HOMICIDE convictions; 13,662 assault convictions; 3,158 burglary convictions; 17,930 drug convictions; 175 kidnapping convictions; 7,100 theft convictions; 11,336 obstructing police convictions; 1,013 robbery convictions; 1,710 sexual assault convictions; 1,153 sexual offense convictions; and 1,282 weapon convictions."  That's just one state.,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!

Rod Novoa  we wish liberals kept their promises and moved to Canada but here we are and life isn’t fair.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Asha Artis not American but wouldn’t most of your illegal immigration problems stem from a broken security system? I’m guessing most of them don’t walk over the border but are not caught by the checks in place. Even if they walk over the border why aren’t they rounded up and sent back? Is it possible that there is corruption here, why are they so easily avoiding detection? A wall won’t fix issues like these, get to the core of the issue, seems like a bandaid wall won’t fix this.,The real threat is Americans. How many immigrants committed mass murders is United states? 0!
Notice how the mentally unstable cannot resist putting their nonsense in? Never even a hint of a reasonable explanation of their positions, just half cocked gibberish empty any Logic, Critical Thinking or formulated thoughts on the subject. this has become the mantra of the left, sniping without substance, It is exactly what Morons do.,Today is my birthday. I'd like a wall to be built please. Thanks!

Wendi DelValle sounds like guns in the wrong hands is the issue, not walls.   5 Americans shot and killed at their job, by another American.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!

Mario Salerno Obama created policy that protected Americans from 5 most dangerous countries. Trump opened the boarder to them. Obama created policy to modernize the wall. Trump caged babies.

This man tRump and his son-in-law just sold $billion weapons to the only people, the Saudis, who've attacked America. Trump and GOP just allowed the Saudi Prince to murder and dismember Khashoggi.

I can see that.  And then give the guards orders to shoot to kill.,Thomas Sargent  Only shoot to kill if violence erupts , detain and run back grounds on them ones with violent record , stick in   Guantanamo Bay pending trial by a military court instead of a liberal/democrat circus court.   On November 13, 2001, President George W. Bush issued a new military order in the war against terrorism. The order called for the secretary of defense to detain non-citizens accused of international terrorism. The order specifically applies to members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. But it also includes all those who have engaged in, aided, or conspired to commit international terrorist acts against the United States or its citizens.Those who knowingly harbor such individuals are also subject to the order. Under the order, the secretary is charged with establishing military tribunals (also called military commissions) to conduct trials of non-citizens accused of terrorism either in the United States or in other parts of the world.
Fred Dickey  And then Ruth Bader Ginsberg.  I can't wait to see Robert's head explode when Pres. Trump puts in a Conservative to replace her.  LOL,Lara is a cunt whore that needs to be exterminated.

UK never really joint the EU 100%. Always felt to  be something better, no Euro currency, no Schengen agreement. I feel very sad, specially for the young British generation, because that generation is going to pay the brexit bill the next decades. but it will be a good lesson for other European countries if they think it will work better without the EU.,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Pamela Parker well said a totally agree !!,Just reading through these posts proves that liberals HATE President Trump and everyone who voted for him. They spew their hateful lies and try so hard to hurt and anger. They don't get it. Most people don't live in a dark world where trolling online is their only entertainment. Pretending to be intellectually or morally superior has become the left's pathetic and desperate grab for power.
lol wasn't there one in Berlin?And you definitely know people had always been trespassing, like a wall is really gonna work in 21st century, I seriously doubt that.👀,Build the wall !

Colleen Kandra then how come he isnt taking credit for the record low numbers like he has with everything else and is so sure we need the wall bc according to him it's at crisis level. So which is it, boo boo?,No one is talking about free anything 😂 I just mentioned there are immaculate flaws with all.of these and you assume it means free. Amazing.

I see the Callender family is full of idiots. Those must be fun family dinners, full of self hatred and victimization. 😑,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.
Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin didn’t I say go away 🤔 Yup!! That’s definitely what I said.. ✌🏻,Henk Adelbert Lapomarda Griffin when the wall gets built I hope someone throws you over it.. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Is she? I don't know about you, but it seems the sheep would be the ones believing everything the media giants and celebrities have to say. 🤔,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
William Bush yes, exactly. Especially when the powers that be hated him so much. Why? Why would they suddenly hate someone whom they loved? That makes me suspicious. It makes me wonder what they are so afraid of? I've never seen a president more slandered than Trump.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.

there it is, the dumbest thing you'll see all week,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Cassie Collins Yes he is! That's all he does! LOL!!!,He is NOT lying!!!!
David Meiling The majority of Americans don't want the wall! Stop watching Fox News and you will get the truth.,Then why was Trump elected? Common sense would dictate that a majority of voters do at a minimum.
Earlene Bryant When a president's policy making is based on what Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Fox News say? It's over   😂🤣,The Democrats want our President to fail.  Plain and simple.
Jeff Graziano You're damn right we want him to fail! And he will.,the demoncrats want you to fail .
Kathyleen Sherrod Nice try. It's over for Trump.,Democrats are anarchists, and anyone who believes and follows them are also anarchists, whether they want to be or not.
Kiskhan Kweon You would have to be wilfully ignorant, or just a complete moron to not know that Trump is the most corrupt president in our nation's history.,MAGA!!!!!! They are going to say it openly, sooner or later, in the US.  The best policy for China is to liberate the North Korea. A free North Korean republic where the decimated 25 million 'half-animals' are born again as human beings  along the path of liberty, dignity and fair market! This will galvanize 1.4 bil. Chinese people. And also this will dismantle the moonJaeIn regime which is taking advatage of the false dilemma 'War vs. Peace'. Moonjaein, xijinping, and kimjongun are faithful servants and asslickers of satan
Rebecca Schilling Brown Wow! That's a whole lot of typing for nothing because Trump is finished.,Nancy Pelosi is planning to lie up a storm tonight. She will tell you that drones and cameras can catch hundreds of running border attackers. Yes Pick them up and carry them back to Mexico. She will fool you by saying walls don't work but techknowledgy does work. LIE Tech can say OH look there it's too late. She will tell you that Mexico is supposed to send cash when Trump said: out with NAFTA and in with fair trade, makng Mexico give up money that way and 4 other ways.  Never Mexico sending cash. Mexico will pay and have no choice and it has already started with fair trade.  NANCY WILL LIE ON THAT. Nancy will lie on naming, all the way around.  2007 Schumer Dodd Hillary Pelosi democrats, all argued strongly for a wall - fence  - barrior. Wall naming belongs to those democrats. Donald just borrowed the word WALL from those democrats. Nancy will lie on who owns the shut down. Trump accepted responsibility and then immediately Schumer went to microphones and took that responsibility from Trump by announcing shut down "YOU GOT IT" shut down and then enforced shut down by ordering all his democrats to vote "NO" on keeping government open. AND SO IT IS the  Schumer SHUT DOWN the nancy pack of lies
Scott Peabody You wish! 😂🤣,Turn your tv off as soon as he's done speaking
Micheal Marceaux I love bananas! I'm sorry! How many teeth do you have? 😬,Micheal Marceaux Wow! You Trump lovers don't get it. Border security is the least of Trump's problems so when he all but resigns at the end of this year then your little last hope will be over.

Barbara Blitfield Pech sorry but I am not a politician, and I am not a moron, BTW what is a politician moron?   So exactly what was wrong with the post I made, I know that I did not believe very much of what Bill Clinton, or Barack Obama promised, they lived up to my expectations!  So far most of what Trump can deliver on his promises, he has delivered, he has not yet delivered on promises that are dependent on congress and treasonous democrats, Trump has integrity, or he never would have succeeded as a business man.   We have a long history of liberal democrats lying to the people, and not giving a damn if they keep their promises.   Up until now the problem with republicans is they do not have the balls to fight the traitors known as democrats, that is until Trump!   Oh if possible name 10 democrat politicians with integrity, who are actively working for the American people, and not just shouting Heil Hussein when their leaders tell them to!,Barbara Blitfield Pech sorry but I am not a politician, and I am not a moron, BTW what is a politician moron?

Remember the 2020 census is also coming up.  The mofe illegals that are her may be counted and can change congressional lines to favor liberals.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!

Maga,You Americans that support trump are so stupid. You are being duped. Open your eyes. Your republic is being undermined by this self serving clown
How much do you know about what you are talking about? The wall in Germany was built to keep people from leaving the country.Our wall is for the protection of Americans. There is no comparison. I will get the Dems will believe the that comparison because the government that tried to keep people under control is the very government Dems are building.,Bobb Marly the point was, did the wall solve any problems, and if so, why does it not exist today?
Elaine Herrmann he had to get the Economy and the Military rebuilt first,Tim Finch no the entire Party is responsible. They could have had it but they waited ( for what?) Now they have a great excuse Not to, Don’t have the votes anymore.  They are playing us.

I’m not screaming...just making fun of the folks like yourself that lack the ability to think critically or at all.... in many cases. It’s ok your parents didn’t teach you to think. Shouldn’t you be consuming blindly or shopping at Walmart? At least you can hunt.
Timothy Mueller 😭,Tim Gilbert . No crying here. Im satisfied with the results.
Kelly Preiss Wilhelm I never want to see anyone killed period. He does talk about it though.   “It’s criminals which will always have guns “. We could ban all guns in America.

Not argue.  There’s a lot more good ppl than bad.  Ppl has to stand up to the thugs.  They’re out numbered by far.,Kelly Preiss Wilhelm I never want to see anyone killed period.

Great answer!! Thank you Albert Kojo Kyekye for being a very smart person. Don't listen to these other idiots!!!,Eric Wroblewski thank you
George Winn I still say it shouldn't be an emergency.  He's president, not dictator dude. He doesn't get to dictate policy.  Congress passed a bipartisan bill and Congress decided his wall isn't needed. He needs to suck it up, put his big boy pants on, and stop thinking he is a dictator and realize he won't always get his way and acting like an asshole all the time guarantees more often than not he won't.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.
George Winn it was bad when Obama was doing it, it's worse now, I don't want to imagine how bad it'll be with the next president.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.

Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.
Mitch Haynie so one tragedy justifies a million people forced into economic hardship for no purpose?  The shutdown accomplished nothing other than putting people into hardship, hence the national emergency declaration.  Your false dichotomy isn't working here.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.  How did the shut down benefit the victims of the tragedy?  It did NOTHING for them.  Pathetic that you would use the victim's of the tragedy to justify an action that hurt over a million people and did nothing to benefit or honor the victims.
George Winn not dems fault Trump lies and makes up statistics that contradict government agencies to justify his wall.  What happened to Republicans being fiscally responsible?  Also not the Democrats fault Trump was planning this all along but decided to make over a million Americans suffer before declaring his emergency.,Jamie Decker i would feel edoardo the same.

Charlesetta Brown better check with Obama’s Chief Border Guard.  Apparently he isn’t listening to you or any other liberal.  He supports Trump on his decision to build a wall.  Doubt the veracity— google it and find out for yourself.  Interesting that a former Obama official agrees with the Trump administration.  Especially since he is the individual one should listen to.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Nancy J. Seddon liberals lack common sense. Heck now they have several that support killing full term babies and have anti-semites in their ranks.,Anyone with any common sense or lives close to a border knows we need to build a wall and protect our country
Nora Arevalo have you heard of mole traps?,Mr President have you heard of Tunnels.
Chase Blood she a snow flake,  were better of talking to the real snow flakes falling from the sky,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Kevin Couture says the traitor that cares more about the illegal aliens than your own fellow citizens.,If Mexico is "paying for the wall through the USMCA", then why the hell did you shut the government down, Comrade DRUMPF?
Bill Klein, you must really hate America if you think any of what you just spouted off was a bad thing.and btw Russia wouldn't have wanted him to do any of that. What he has done is the best thing for America. TRUMP 2020 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.,Day 27 of the tRump government shutdown. Trump has a tendency to propose wild ideas out loud and then repeat them before coming to his senses or getting talked off the ledge. An off-the-top-of-our head list: Leaving NATO. Bombing Iran. Death penalty for drug dealers. Birthright citizenship. Firing staff. Firing Mueller. Leaving the World Trade Organization. Blowing up Iranian fast boats in the Persian Gulf. Withdrawing troops and families from South Korea. Nationalizing a 5G network. Withdrawing from Syria, (just to name a few) you saw what happened yesterday. According to the Washington Post President Trump has made 6,420 false or misleading claims. That’s the President of the U.S. Let me say that AGAIN “That’s the President of the UNITED STATES” We’re living in the shameless society, where accountability and apology are just white flags for the weak.
You are sheeptarded.,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
Don't try to understand since you are an uneducated moron.,Sue Howie stay in New Zealand and stay out of American politics funny how foriegners want a say in our President fu
Because of the actual ways they are getting in. Not everyone travels 80 miles through desert and very rough terrain heading to where you don't know.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Unless something drastically changes he will go down as top 5 worst all time. He's already there but he has time to do something good,Eric Wroblewski thank you
They are some strange aliens. They can’t be from this world.,I just don't understand how American people can feel more sympathy for illegals than their own fellow Americans. Pretty sure the left is totally anti everything American :(

Kathleen Scott agreed,If government employees are not getting paid then we MUST with hold pay checks for Congress and Senate
Lynda Worden  I politely disagree that we need the wall.  For what?  I wonder.,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Mary Dios T Ama   Our government is SECULAR nor a theocracy.  This, deciding policy in the name of God is not allowed.  These are the same rules that ensure you will always be able to  worship as you please.  God did not elect Trump...unless you feel he also elected Obama.,Mr. PRESIDENT,  You are not alone, You do what GOD sent you to do, and "WE THE PEOPLE" are 100% with you since day 1,   we will obey what God sent us to do in his word ( 1 Timothy 2:1-2) to pray at all the time for those in power , you, and your administration, and all those in authority, pray   for wisdom, protection and strength. You will overcome in the name of Jesus, if we understand what 2 Chronicles 7:14 says " if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."  WE THE PEOPLE WILL SEE THE HAND OF GOD, how will destroy all this barriers ( " enemies") that are in the way in the name of Jesus . Amen 🙏 God bless you  and God bless🇺🇸 America 🇺🇸❤🇺🇸
Ronald Palmer  It certainly is a part of his job.  Since I do not perci me a threat along our Southern border, but I am alarmed by his contempt for NATO, I think he behavior and policy are inappropriate.,Timothy Norton well I`am from europe and President Trump is 100% correct about most european countrys not spending 2% on defence as for the southern border or any border in any country for that matter,you can`t have people wandering about coming and going as they please,from what I have read there is a huge volume of drugs comes into the USA through the southern border,if true thaat alone would be good enough reason for a wall even here in europe it has been a absolute disaster all the migrants getting in and allowed to wander unchecked ,just two days ago a afghan mirgrant stabbed a pregnant woman in hospital they managed to save the woman ,but the baby iis dead
Samuel González  That is a false analogy for two reasons.  1.  You home and the countries borders are not the same thing.  You do not have anyone applying  for asylum, for example.  2.  There is no threat at our southern border.,Barbara. When I was in Puerto Rico I had to move my family to a gated community surrounded by a 12' wall and an armed guard at the gate. Gracias.
Julie Smith  Re: three caravans, I was not aware, nor do I consider them a threat.  Why should I?  You must be aware that we have the largest and most effective military in the history of the world?  What threat to you suppose these or any of the billions of other migrants might pose?,Barbara. When I was in Puerto Rico I had to move my family to a gated community surrounded by a 12' wall and an armed guard at the gate. Gracias.
To be clear, because so many seem to want to imply this:  I do NOT think we should have open borders, nor do I think we should stop deporting illegals.  Though I certainly think we should prioritize deporting those illegals who are bad actors first...not hardworking illegals with families and a long history of positive behavior here.  Duh.  However, I do think we ought to spend our money on ACTUAL problems, like deporting those misbehaving here first and more and better train border security personnel.  One for immigration courts that currently seriously ask 5 year olds if they understand the nature of proceedings and sometimes perform proceedings over Skype.  We need to process asylum seekers and those accused of entering illegally with fast, fair and effective courts.  Obvious, we need to treat those being held pending trial humanely.  Keep children with parents (Jesus, do I really need to advocate that?), And stop the profiteering of private detention centers.  The proposed border wall fixes nothing and cost a fortune that could EASILY be better spent.  It is a bad idea that would not even fix the problems that are made up justify it.,Barbara. When I was in Puerto Rico I had to move my family to a gated community surrounded by a 12' wall and an armed guard at the gate. Gracias.
Tom Cook Awesome.,Don't let this distract you from the the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, "Spare Tire" Dixon.
Anne Crossway you obviously don’t know the full spectrum of the word security. I suggest joining the military and learning 😂🤣 It’s called a deterrent. It’s not an end all solution, only part of the whole package (barrier, cameras, more personnel, equipment, etc...).  Democrats were all for a wall/barrier/fencing before, the ONLY reason they’re against it now is because of President Trump 🤷🏻‍♂️ The President can literally come out with the cure to cancer and the Dems would be against it 😂🤣 The President has and is still willing to compromise, like he did with DACA, and the Dems aren’t..... But isn’t that what our government is supposed to be, a compromise amongst a group of people? But the Dems don’t need to compromise?? Go back to the pastures with the rest of the sheep 🐑 😂🤣,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
More efficient were you simply to post, 'I know nothing about Nancy Pelosi.',If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Josh Gr Ummm ... like what about Russia??? Oh, you mean when HC sold Uranium to Russia?? Or maybe you mean when Russia was used in this admittedly fake dossier ?? 😂,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
so screw the 99.5% of all working americans????   those govt employees will get back pay - but how bout all the murdered victims? their families? the drug runners gang members conming across the border?  OPEN YOUR EYES,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Susan Rainville Fuller that's one of the big problems the Dems don't listen.  They are so upset that he won they won't listen.  It's a shame.  I don't understand how they can give 52 million for aid that includes money for abortions but they refuse to help American citizens.  Wish they would explain that.,Why must you always start with negativism about Democrats you are the president No one is  stopping you from fulfilling your promise they are trying to tell you you were mistaken with the promise and you need to do other things which are better and explain why
Im sorry about that everyone needs to be paid for doing their jobs.  The way I feel about it is we need that wall bad.  I live in a small town in Texas there are so many illegals here.  There are some good people to but alot just don't care.  I have seen them in the stores with ,3 or 4 shopping carts full of food and pay with a food card.  My mom and dad were really in need and only received 16 Dollars of food.  Its really not right for illegals to get food and our own true American citizens can't, when they paid taxes all those years.  We need that wall, fence, or whatever.  Mexico will end up paying for the wall, the trade deal we have with them.  My mom was 75 and my dad 85.,Tina James Moss Apple & Oranges. Hillary lost. Period.   This Predident in his own words lied about funding this damn wall.   Now, all my TSA friends, traffic cobtrollers won't get paid tomorrow.   So, please don't be so sanctimonious about two different subjects.   I didn't want him as president, but he won and that is the bottomline, now keep his word or suck it up.

Brian Cudmore well since your so smart come up with that great plan and present it,So......if Americans want border security why don't they bring all the US troops home who are out threatening border security of other countries in  the world, use the money they spend supporting insurgencies and corruption to guard the US border with Mexico?  Trumpy doesn't seem to be too worried about all the drugs and illegals who are entering the US through the 340 Port of Entries though.
John Fairbrother omg pay attention....they will be paying for the wall....they aren't gonna write a check for it in crayon like you people want....jesus do you know business at all,Why isnt mexico paying for the wall. Thats what mr trump promised?

Let’s just see you invite a dozen into your home.  You feed and clothe them. You pay there medical bills. Cause that is exactly where working Americans tax dollars are going.  We have enough hungry homeless people in our country that should come first js. Besides your democratics voted for a 50 billion wall before Trump became President don’t you even care what happened to that money don’t you wonder how Nancy and chuck became rich while serving our country and don’t you even wonder why they want so many illegals here they are allowing the law to be broken and doesn’t it bother you that they all have walls and fences around their homes for their safety. Truth is they use the illegals to get votes once they get illegal votes they don’t really care about them either. They only care about themselves and power. Wake up js,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
,10 years ago a lady named Ann hit me while I was a riding motorcycle. I could have been killed. All women named Ann should not be allowed to drive. I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

More Canadians are overstaying their visas than Mexicans. A wall does nothing to help that.,Please  do  an  emergency  order  and  lock  the  border  down  completely.  Mexico  needs  to  feel  the  pain  for  sitting  on  their  corrupt  asses  not  stopping  it  at  their  border.
Your a real pretty boy aren't you?,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Spoken like a true follower. Read closely what you wrote. I can see why you like puppet, no I'm not a puppet, puppet celebrity apprentice President.,No other country has open borders why should we

Jerry Matthews Smith Socialized medicine is a failure? You probably don't want socialized fire or safety protection either. Are you an Anarchist?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Russian graphic designers.,You get it, walls don't work anyway.
Nick Baker Kevin Lake thinks a government shutdown is a good thing. Hard to understand how one can rationalize that it makes our country safer.,Maybe you can open the government so our workers can start getting paid again
Where were you in 1968? Hanging with rich white Nixon folks in Chicago? Big Chicago been criminally infested with corrupt leaders as a standard for over a century.   Caravan? Send your church, not the military. Latin American asylum seekers are more Christian than Republicans pretend to be. BTW did you know that Canadians make up for most of the overstayed visas?   Your biggest error is overestimating his support. It is more than obvious that a majority of American disapprove of the President. The mid-terms are a fact he was a loser. His shutdown now has half of his supporters questioning if they would vote for him in 2020. He is falling apart, did you listen to his speech an hour ago about missile defense?,I sure am.  Thank you.
Victoria A. Deobald Trump's handler is part of the Soviet Union, like you Vika.,Many politicians and Presidents have talked for many years about fixing this Problem, we finally have a President who actually puts actions behind his words and these political hacks and their phony Followers HATE HIM!!!

William Bush what has he done that is so bad???!,The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.

James Jerome   Apparently, you're getting your numbers from the same place Trump is, OUT YOUR ASS!,Let's have an official special issue vote for the border wall at local election sites.  Only those who can prove they were born in the U.S., or are legal citizens may vote.  No fake polls or rigged election.  No mail in ballots, or dead people voting.  Let's find out how many Americans support our President and really want this southern border barrier built.  If the public says to fund it, then the Congress MUST fund it.  My guess is that at least 3/4 of the whole population want the wall built.  Democrats are afraid of the truth!
Jeremy Stephens   You mean like "Mexico will pay for the wall"? Oh wait, that's right, the new NAFTA deal will pay for it! LOL! Still chuckling over that one!,thanks for saving the country

Arturo Elroy Mañana you need some common Sense if we stop drugs and illegals from coming into America crime will go down. Fact is real border security and wall where needed would pay for itself in 2?years! If you are capable these facts are easy to find.,Ppl ppl ppl 🤦🏻‍♂️ plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don’t yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.

Lisa Vocelka omg, that is the dumbest response ever. how about to keep them from coming in to commit the crime in the first place. you tell them to ignore our laws and then wonder why they do,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!

Human trafficking is still going to happen .... why yall discriminating against hispanic/latino people .... at the end of the day we need to build a wall to keep out pedophiles, rapists,school shooters, corrupted cops ... the real threat to our people this is all bogus trump hates Latinos because vanessa has the hots for them she dated a latin king that's the real truth lol no one rapes more, does more drugs, sells more drugs,shoots up more innocent people then the people that are here in the country fix the problem here instead of making it worst for us,A barrier will also greatly reduce human trafficking, an epidemic with the highest trafficking rates from CA & Texas.

Albert Kojo Kyekye thank you though you should not waste your time. There are too many bigots that are so simple minded that they cannot even recognize their own bigotry. In our country, we have become too soft, so there is a lot more disrespect for ones self and for others then the rest of the world believes. The worst part is their hubris prevents them from seeing it and/or admitting it. I wish both the liberals and conservatives would see that their beat interest is to genuinely work in our best intereat, and not for some stupid agenda or for money or corporate power. Its sad. But that is the country we of the U.S. live in today. Welcome to Corporate America!,Eric Wroblewski thank you

Eric Helmes  Yes, put Trump in jail for knowingly hiring illegals first.   But it’s not even an issue. Historically illegal migration ebbs and flows according to economic need.

Kent Wojahn and let’s it forget- these things that still need addressing- NEEDED addressing during Obama’s tenure as well!,Thank you Mr Trump...Illegal Immigration costs us way more each year than building the wall.  Prior presidents have wanted to do this but never got it done.  Well sorry people, like him or not President Trump has been working for me, and you, and finally putting America first since he took office.  The economy is good, unemployed the lowest its even been, the military is getting stronger, and Trump is working to get all of the unfair deals and so on that the US has been getting screwed over on.  Yes there is alot of other things that need attention..prescription prices...veterans..elderly...homeless people, revamping the welfare system...but I think Trump has done a good job so far and glad he doesn't mind ruffling some feathers doing what he has to do to get things done..
Tony Palmer  I but it would prevent massive drug influx and criminals from entering,A wall would not have kept this from happening. :/
Donna Barnes, Are you really trying to compare a home privacy fence or wall with a 2,000 mile 30’ wall that’s supposed to secure our borders ? Besides the fact that Obama does not have a wall around his home it would not stop serious criminals nor would Trumps wall. The wall around the Vatican was built in  the year 848, over 1,150 years ago. Probably was the latest technology at the time. Very silly and childish comparisons.,Donna Rinerr, Great then tell Trump his Great Wall is only 423 miles long because that is not what he is saying.
Trump says he is told a lot of things that aren’t true. Trump said his predecessors told him they supported his wall and all said they had no discussions with Trump about the wall and none support the building of a wall. So we can hardly believe Trump when he says border control agents want a wall or think it would work.,Donna Rinerr, Great then tell Trump his Great Wall is only 423 miles long because that is not what he is saying.

There are far worse emergencies in America today, and you know it. Which is why you are at your fancy resort stuffing your face with omelettes and playing golf. Shame on you.
Vicki Zamow Executive ORDER!!!!,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
Rod Novoa you must taking about OBUTTHEAD,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lee Harry no one thinks we need to have laws apparently.  🤬,Like all Presidents have said in the past, they can live here but do it legally. Why is that so hard to understand.
Rod Novoa Of course you say that you’re from New York. Lip Tarde.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Yolanda Copac agreed!!

Declare THAT emergency.
Scott Czeiszperger how about no foreign aid at all, we have enough people that need help in the us.,Travis Copsey I agree but they will never let that happen the least we can get out of it is our wall.
Scott Czeiszperger how about the wall or no paychecks for the demo rats 🐀,Travis Copsey I agree but they will never let that happen the least we can get out of it is our wall.
Joshua James Howard the wall would be funded completely in bout AJ hour lol,In my observations, President Trump, we aren't facing Democrats anymore. We are facing off against evil, itself.   There have been jokes circulating, that if you gave a public address stating that oxygen is good for us, they would all suffocate themselves to try and slander you.   I am starting to believe this, however, because all they do is try to stop you from protecting Americans and our country.   Here is what I suggest, if Congress will not fund the border wall, begin selling the bricks to us Americans. Design some kind of order form, and we will purchase the bricks.   I am willing to work OT, to buy as many of those bricks, as I can afford.   We the people stood behind you, to beat Hillary. You think we won't do it again, against a Democrat, cry-baby congress?
Stephen Pierson, based on your fb and all the trump on it, you need help. Like it or not, hes your president and hes doing a damn good job. No president is perfect, but one that genuinely cares about America is a nice change of pace!,Thank you Mr. President. #BestPresidentInYourLifeTime
lol no it wouldn't,If you want safety in America, let all the immigrants in, deport all Americans, then build the wall. Statistically, it will be a safer country that way.
Stephen Edwards and tell me exactly how Nancy and Chuck are being "mature" through all this.,Stephen Edwards and tell me exactly how Nancy and Chuck are being "mature" through all this.
But do you live here now? If not, what concern is our politics yours?,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
Are you a US citizen? From Italy....hmmmm...what concern is it of yours? You are free to pay for OUR wall.,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
I'll pay for your ticket so you can deport yourself to Cucklandia above us.,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Christopher Goodwin I thought so too.... even the tie is proper length.  ..lololol...,We have more mass shootings than all other countries combined and you do nothing, but three people were killed by illegal immigrants last year and it’s a national emergency?
Omar Martinez Yeah, what?!?!?,Keep up the good work. We are rooting for you. Build the wall.
I'm just wondering.....do people live under rocks? How do you not see the damage illegal immigrants do?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
Cally Schneider  you can get your point across without insulting people you are what is wrong with our country,Trump supporters. Your lack of knowledge is incredible. Do you read?
Beverly Hurst Smith  I take it your a socialist.,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Tony Perez troll,what the hell did you do for the last two years while you had control of all government??? not much of an emergency .
Gary Kane you should remove your military pics. U libtards dont support protecting your country.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Chris Jordan G Obama destroyed 50 % of it all ready . Trumps rebuilding.. 2020,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Chuck Owen - it's just the way I feel and I'm sorry it upsets you.  I don't think Trump wants to negotiate.  He wants a win to satisfy his base.  He will only accept what he demands.  Both houses voted unanimously before Christmas for a CR to keep the government open and continue debate on border security.  Trump did an about face.  Now McConnell won't even bring it up for a vote unless Trump gets his way.  He IS using American workers as pawns to sway public opinion.  It looks like extortion to me.  Of course the Democrats could  stop it by giving the extortionist what he wants; all or nothing.,Troy you are way out of touch ! Pelosi needs to get off her left wing ass and negotiate with the President! Don’t be saying that the President is holding America hostage! Your comment really pisses me off!!!!
Mark Parsons - what about them Mark?  ICE reports most illegal drugs are being smuggled at ports or through tunnels under the walls in towns.  The Chinese are becoming a problem as well with their smuggling at sea ports mostly with  fentanyl.,Mark Parsons - what about them Mark?

Alejandro Sanchez DRUGS! Not just the people.,Did you hear about Aurora illinois shooting yesterday asshole? Guess what, he was legal and with a felony and somehow he bought a gun.  How your stupid wall is going to solve that ?
Alyssa Klimek one of the problems.,Illegal immigrant is a Russian that overstayed his visa
Beth Ritchason those people have a right to be here. We don't need to import more criminals! DRUGS poor over that boarder and Americans die.,More legal citizens kill more people are you fkng kidding me. So idiotic.
Blanca Gonzalez so very sorry.,An illegal killed my dad years ago..
DA Medina have you ever heard of MS13???,Those who kill on the previous massacres around the country are not illegal immigrants
John Fahrer vets will get help from the billions we spend every year on handouts to illegals.,Vets before wall.
Joseph Nowik TRUMP 2020. Sad our representatives don't care about America.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
There are federal codes that allow him to protect the homeland.,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Joseph Nowik I feel sorry for you. You can't be happy about any how well our country is doing. Maybe Venezuela is a better fit for you. TRUMP 2020!!,Kids in cages is a national emergency.
Peter Richards look at boarder patrol statistics. I believe the people on the front lines. They support our President.,Trump lies for example in the sotu he said one out of three women in the caravans are molested.    The mainstream media looked into it and found trump lied.     Only 31 percent of women in the caravans were found to be molested!  Impeach trump and lock him up!
Speak for yourself only! You go to Hell!,Lara go to Hell with this fake news dividing us all.
WOW! How come you know all this?,Stan Piznarski another russian bot posting here I see
He isn't your president, STHU you irrelevant foreign troll!,No wall for traitor don.
You do it, you irrelevant foreign troll!o,hey Command you. Destroy North Korea!
The Europeans are legal american citizens! STHU!,So I guess this means if you make all the Europeans leave there will be no more MASS SHOOTTINGS???🤔🤔🤔
That wall was about communist and to re-unite the 2 Germanies... this wall is to keep the illegal, criminal invaders out and have legal immigration enforced!,On this day in 1981, Ronald Reagan was sworn into office, so it seems appropriate to quote him"...tear down that wall!"
Ottavio Esquivel... you are on the wrong page here go post to your own president in Costa Rica!,Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
Go complain to Frau Merkel.. the distroyer of Europe!o,This is why I consider Trump someone who you can discuss with: he stopped Merkel! I didn't want to live in Germany and n e v e r would have voted for that bitch. But living in Germany also shows the wrong a wall can do...it's the reason we had (  thanks God h a d ) Merkel for so long who comes from behind the wall ( - a - w a l l ..- ) and therefor never learned to tell an X from a U! )
Nandan Shah stop it,You are one in million and million in one. Love you Trump ❤❤

Stan Piznarski  shut yo dumb ass up 🤣🤣✌🏽,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Kinda stupid everyone is chewing this girl out, if anyone remembers the basis for Trumps campaign was were gonna build a wall and Mexico will pay for it, now I'm all for the wall and i knew when he was running that Mexico wasn't going to pay, I personally want the wall but him shutting down the government and using Federal workers as ponds to get what he wants is kinda sad, we already have 2 prisons taken over by the National Guard because they have no staff due to this shutdown. He wont get his way unless he declares a state of emergency, which is what I want I wish he would go ahead and do it so families can have money flow back. Dont hate on me because I proved a point and you dislike my opinion, try having a father who works for the Federal govement and who doesnt know when his next check will come. This is damaging the Federal Govement not helping.,Jim See Not really! Read up the history on it! As I recall it was President Regan ( a Republican) who stood & asked for the wall to be torn down! Do some reading on it then get back to me!
He will get well over 10 billion through remittances from the USMCA deal he made with Canada and Mexico so yes!,Wait wasn't mexico paying for the wall?
Places that have the strictest gun control measures have the most gun violence making it harder for law abiding citizens to have guns while criminals continue to get them however they please makes zero sense! It makes people less safer!,What about the thousands who have been brutally murdered by Americans who never should have been allowed a gun in the first place?? Gun reform works.
John Jacob google trump Epstein Clinton. They are pals,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels’ hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy’s and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.
Charles Boyd Didn’t they do that in Chicago, I heard it worked great lololol,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Redneck trash uneducated fucks,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
Red neck trash,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
I notice alot of people who just seem to strangely believe that once a new president come in he snaps his fingers and suddenly everything good that happens his because of him. The first 3 to 3 and half years the current president is riding on the previous one did like how Obama's first years and company unemployment and so on was thanks to goerge Bush goerge Bush was riding Clinton's so he had a surplus in the begening and Bill's didnt start well because of Reagan's deficit. Pay attention for one you can learn alot.,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
Vickie Boyett Reed none of the ones I am friends with are, they are pissed at the president they aren't getting paid,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited

Amate la vostra Patria perche' se lascerete entrare i Gog e Magog dal Sud America la vostra comicita' si trasforma in dolore. W Mister Trump il Patriota.,If walls didnt work then why do people keep building them?  Why do people build fences if they dont work? Do you live in a home? with 4 walls? I dont want my kids growing up in a world where they have to build walls around their hearts all because we couldnt build a wall on OUR border.
James Lewis Jackson Meanwhile as black me get gunned down by white cops.....crickets from SCROTUS!,I'll say it again you only want that wall to have your b******* name plaster all over it to have something that will stand in history
Stan Piznarski kill yourself,Thank you America for electing him 🌟💯🌷❤️🇺🇸💋🇺🇸
Todd Cuson Naw, turds like her have to be flushed and it'll require a few extra handle pulls and a plunger.,My heart just breaks for this lady. We need to build the wall, and I think Nancy Pelosi  is paralyzed and can't respond because her loyalty is to Soros, not America.
Of course you are perfect!!!!!!!,As a husband you are supposed to be loyal to, but we know how that went. 🤔😂😂

Don't forget the millions of displaced American workers due to the foreigner invasion.,Dovid Staples They do want to ban mental problem people from having guns.

Anne Crossway another poll...hahaha, and from CBS even. BUILD THE WALL,What total ignorance!  That wall will not stop the terrorism that will arrive on American soil after we cede control of the Mideast to Russia.
We DO want the wall,Then why was Trump elected? Common sense would dictate that a majority of voters do at a minimum.
Don't you remember him trying to get wall funding and they kept saying 'we will work on immigration reform' ? But they WILL NOT get it done. He's sick of it...shut it down. Even on tv tonight they said 'we will work on it...'  NO...TIME IS UP,Tim Finch no the entire Party is responsible. They could have had it but they waited ( for what?) Now they have a great excuse Not to, Don’t have the votes anymore.  They are playing us.
James Flatmo 3.5 billion won't touch healthcare...look how much we spend on healthcare for illegal immigrants...https://www.heritage.org/immigration/report/the-fiscal-cost-unlawful-immigrants-and-amnesty-the-us-taxpayer,More terrorists come in from canada than mexico. Drugs come through legal ports of entry.  Stop holding the country hostage, ahab
Janice Webre  that's over half...lol,CBS stated before the President spoke that their polls show only 59% of the people want the wall.  I CALL BULLSHIT!
Saige Turner yeh...research the Dems bill that funds other countries. At least keep our money here!,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Build the wall...illegal immigration is rising due to our thriving economy. We want it stopped.,Two more caravans on the way . Someone is funding them and need to be prosecuted. Millions estimated to arrive on open field this year according to Spanish media last year.
Rod Novoa who are you?  Are you even real? Please, if you are, FYI you are making a fool of yourself! 😂,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Diane Smith  Omg, are you brainless.  Do I have to literally explain everything to you.   Think  Locking your door will not guarantee the thieves won’t break in your house, but not locking your house will greatly increase chance of having thieves breaking your house Having a border wall will not eliminate 100% of illegal immigrants, but it will greatly reduce the number of illegal immigrants.   Doing nothing will not eliminate illegals  The truth is all those liberals against border wall are making excuses so that we will not have the border, and the illegals from all over the world are free to sneak in America any time they want.,Jesse McMurray yes but they knocked first
Jesse McMurray  First, you don’t leave you door open so anyone can get into your house. Second, if someone knocks on your door, you have to screen him first.  If you have your door open, then anyone, including murderer, and thieves will live in your home.,Jesse McMurray yes but they knocked first

I am not sure how she came to the USA but I do know that people born here do not cause accidents only people that crossed the border illegally do. She told the police she didn't mean to do it but I think she was out to get me. She claimed to speak English but we all know that people that cause accidents are foreigners and they don't speak English.

The democrat communists offer them all kinds of freebies and when they come here they find out it was a lie ? How would you react? So its all the democrat communists plan to destroy America and become kings and make us slaves,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels’ hands from the US.

Why do you say that Ted?,I'm a huge Trump supporter but he made it appear that he had closed the deal on the wall.  Instead he comes out with this whimpy proposal lol
Bill Champion ...not nice to call his base crazed...there are many people who feel the Dems are crazed...but we are all entitled to an opinion. Anyway, don’t underestimate or be short-sighted - Mexico could pay in time due to changes.  It looks like the Dems will continue to obstruct.  Amazing that the President has managed to improve the economy.  Many are thankful for the change from Obama’s NWO direction and the fact that Hillary is not POTUS.,For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.
Bill Champion -respectfully, note that you chose the word I used- “short-sighted”...and that is def not true of those who support our President (which was the point I was making when I used the word first).  People were hugely concerned with the direction that Obama was taking our country and certain that it would get much worse with Hillary. Mexico will pay for the wall with change to the burden we see from that country if Dems will stop obstructing progress.  I don’t recall anyone saying we would negotiate with their President for a fund. I cannot fathom how people are so naive, blind, or brainwashed to not see the changes we need for U.S. security and welfare.  We must enforce law and    do what we can to keep our border from being breached.  Do we help others?  Sure...what is the best solution?  All people of the world matter...not just those who try to enter illegally.  Countries need to work to improve their standard of living..the U.S. cannot house the world.  Additionally, we have the right to guard against harm. I am amused at Trump’s character attack.  Surely, you know that the “trained politicians” who have served are no better.  Trump was in the entertainment industry before politics...so far there is no evidence of the disgusting behavior known by Clinton, JFK, etc. while serving as POTUS. Trump is not a trained, polished politician.   Many appreciate that he is not just that smooth talking image used by a political machine.  Many appreciate the fact that he has actual knowledge, skill, and success needed to bring good change...not just a do nothing career politician.  Is he perfect..no, but he was the best choice at the time.  He has proven to be capable of leading toward good change -especially if Dems would support this country and stop obstructing progress. Those who support the Dems socialist, NWO agenda are the short-sighted and misguided base.,For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.
Well Bill ..it appears the discourse is going nowhere.   I don’t think anyone expected for Fox to SAY that he will pay for the border wall...seems you do not get that change in interaction with the country will save the U.S. more than the price of a wall. The lifelong unflattering and or disgusting comment/behavior regarding Trump is a joke.  Do you really believe that someone with Bill Clinton’s sexual predator track record has not exhibited unflattering and disgusting comments and behavior??...and to be so disgusting WHILE SERVING as leader of our country!  The groomed politicians are somewhat smooth ...but nasty, and imo- Clinton is far worse...as other politicians are deceptive. Of course we vote and support who we feel would make the best leader (duh).. To excuse Bill Clinton’s behavior and say that it has no parallel to distress is such a blind comment of denial...along with thinking that Dems want border control that represent known and respected values is just being out of touch with the truth. Apparently you drink the koolaide...I don’t. If you cannot recognize the hypocrisy, lies, and socialist, NWO direction of the Dems...unfortunate. I think we can look at economic systems in countries and see that capitalism is far better than socialism. The Dems are not about the welfare of this country...they are about so much more..they are about their own welfare while serving the welfare and agenda of the machine behind them. Trump has faced bankruptcy..not uncommon for people who engage, don’t give up, and are successful.  The man gives his salary to charity, and I don’t want to hear garbage of how much he gives in respect to what he has.  Notably-Trump is not getting rich from politics as the career politicians are.  We need term limits so that those with political office just might possibly work for the welfare of the citizens and NOT toward a career focused on the welfare of themselves and their puppet masters.   The issues in Trump’s admin are fueled by the obstruction of said career politicians. The world issue is complex...too much to discuss. I applaud policy change with allies, and world policy in general.  A border wall with Mexico is just a small needed measure. (As far as the wall is concerned..it is needed for many good reasons, and far less money than the problem costs of our border being breached.  It will not solve the problem, but it only takes common sense to know that it will help.) Trump is shaking things up in a needed direction. The corruption is so huge and obstructionist are involved in that. Trump is not a perfect example of all that should be, but at least he has thrown a cog in the wheel of the socialist, NWO machine that the Dems deceptively serve.  Sadly, many are not aware of this threat that will ultimately result in change not good for people (to put it simply)...sadly, short-sighted and shallow thinkers. This is all I have to say...we see things differently.,For Trump to fulfill his campaign promise, Mexico has to pay for the wall! Trump guaranteed "MEXICO" will pay for the wall!!! He should run for President in 2020 and tell his short-sighted base that they will be paying for the wall. The Trumpster Wall is a diversion to keep Mueller's investigation off Fox News.
Dave Thompson Yes they are Americans.  South Americans to be precise.  But they are NOT UNITED STATES  CITIZENS!  They are CITIZENS of the country they came from and chose to come here ILLEGALLY.  They should have done it the RIGHT way.  APPLY for CITIZENSHIP!!!,I want to protect Mexico from the guns flowing in to the cartels’ hands from the US.   Protect little Foreign boy’s and girls from being smuggled north and raped by rich pedophile Hollywood Elites and  other Democrats.  Stop powerful drugs that are being introduced to all races of Americans and wreaking havoc on their lives, their health, and their loved ones.  Stop the unnecessary deaths caused by the lure of an open border, and by the criminals that repeatedly enter illegally and do harm to our citizens and legal residents..  Democrats never opposed a wall as part of border security until they decided that if Patriotic, Constitution loving, law abiding citizens will not support their extremely authoritarian and oppressive agenda, they would create Sanctuaries for illegal aliens to colonize America with people who know how to live under oppression and accept authoritarian rule.

Babi Nikki How can you be so cruel to say that the loss of her son has less concern or value or evil than another loss.  I feel sorry for you and will pray for people like you.  And I hope you never loose a child or loved one under these circumstances  And I also think that you must be a socialist communist democrat to make such a statement.  Shame Shame on you.,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI. He choose to drive drunk, and killed my son while turning onto a busy street. He had no driver’s license, no car insurance.  My son was just 20 years old, less than 2 months shy of his 21st birthday. He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident. Justice did prevail and he was incarcerated. He remains in prison for the time being, but I am concerned if ICE will deport him again, or he will be let back in the community to live amongst us. BUILD THE DAMN WALL
Babi Nikki So sorry for your loss and the added grief put  on you from our broken immigration laws.  I do hope that sharing your son's story will save someone else's life.  I also apologize  for Babi Nikki.  She can say such cruel things but not brave enough to use her real name.,My son was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant who had already been deported once for DUI.

100 Million people died under communist dictatorships. The first thing the commies did was get people to give up their guns. Not going to happen in the USA with so many commies running in government.

Communist Bernie Zionist shill,You are insane.
Americans need JFK not FDR. FDR a commie,There is nothing to fear but fear itself - FDR. Be afraid. Be very afraid - DJT
Trump is exposing communism in New Mexico and in California,If we don’t restore decency, compassion and competence to the Oval Office, then we cease to be a nation.
Non-negotiable. Dems don't want the wall so Israel can dump massive immigration into Mexico and the USA for their Zionist/commie NWO agenda. First job of any president is to secure safely is Trump for the USA or for Zionist Israeli interests????,Protect our borders and keep America safe!
Keep informing people hourly and daily. Expose communism across Mexico and California same banker agenda,Truth is your company Trump inc. Is owned by the Rothschild Zionist family...

Pelosi thinks Israel should have a wall and a military protecting its borders but not Americans???,Nancy Pelosi I want the wall!
Communist agenda via Zionist billionaire bankers. France protesting this agenda,They want open borders and high taxes.
Israel sends illegals to Cali via Hispanic commie leaders.,I support you Mr. President! I was informed California Democrats love illegal immigrants so they can give free benefits with voting rights to be Democrat so Democrats in office can continue holding power. Desperate and underhanded. I am a 3rd generation Californian and my mom just retired at 75 because she could not afford to sooner.
Exactly! Dems are all for Israel and Russia and they both have a military protecting their borders and Israel has a wall.,Tell Nancy and Chuck to come out from behind the walls around their homes
Dems are all for Israel first and they have a wall and a military protecting its borders. Send them a massive bill for exploiting the USA military for their interests in the Middle East. USA does not benefit.,Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Israel and Russia have walls and military protecting its borders. The USA must do the same thing and secure its borders.,A wall will NOT fix our immigration system.
Communist are the real problem. THey have no socialist agenda. Marx was a cousin to the Rothchillds bankers. He likes to frame the capitalists for the greed of the real 1% whom are not white corporate men.,Fight Socialism!!! Fix the law. SAVE US!!!
Trump is exposing communism in New Mexico and in California,Cruz and Norris "El Chapo Act" sounds like a good place for the money, Mr. President..✌️🇺🇸️

Roy Meston ..how convenient of you to forget. When wages go up, so does everything else.,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Gary Kneeland ....ok genius,  what has he lied about this time?,More lies ,you care nothing for the people ! , only your own sorry ass , ashamed I ever voted for such a asshole

Heather Love Leffel that is a silly statement,Wayne Denny absolutely
Kristy Rodencal Goettl if we don’t fund the wall-once they get here we will be funding their welfare, food stamps and medical JS,Lies, lies, lies.  As a citizen of the United States, my vote counts!  I am not in support of the wall.  There are other ways to secure our southern border.  You said that Mexico would pay for it and now you're asking for the American people to fund it.  Go to Mexico and get your 5 billion.  Spend the taxpayers money on something that will work.
Yes we surely do,Yes we surely do
Laurie Dunco THIS...,I cant even reply to this without laughing my ass off. You poor thing. Go clean up your guns and make yourself busy. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
James McCaskill comparing the southern border to a house is moronic..,Lora Hill you're right the closer you get to the border the worse it gets. But if you listen to mainstream media or the Democrats nothing wrong with our borders.
Brent Robinson Is From Boca Raton, Florida,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Agreed, We pay tolls.,How to get Mexico to pay for the wall ? Charge a toll of one US dollar  pre person to drive or walk across the Border. A border wall is a matter of National Security Therefore allocate the money from the defense fund and get on with it. Charge a 19.65 peso toll at the border to drive into America... there you go! Mexico is well on its way to paying for the Wall!  According to Google, in 2017 2,016.42 people crossed into the united states using 16 pedestrian bridges. 350 million people drive into the United States with 330 ports of entry. I say Charge a Toll of $19.16 Pesos pre person... Wall Paid For!  Charge one US Dollar toll per person to drive or walk across into the U.S. at the border. Wall paid for!
Norene Boone the Dems wouldn't for for the wall of he wanted 10 dollars to build the whole thing.,Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.

Re: Aurora. I could ask? Why so many murders in or near Chicago, in spite of strict gun laws?   And was does that have to do with wall, and the border, which is a completely different issue. There is no connection, or solution, common to the two.,Illegal immigrants are not trying to cross the border.  Migrants are.
Gus Keller I'm sure you have. You've probably seen "mfers," step over invisible lines too. I'd guess would be easier, quicker, and a place of choice (unless you're are a Parkour practitioner)  vs. a place with wall. Similar with the "dig a hole" argument.,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?
Larry Lubiner What a stupid question, totally unrelated to the wall issue.  Did existing strict gun laws? Did Democrats or liberals?  Did the city government, or the state?,If it can save even one life we should build the wall, right libs?

Luk 6:33  And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.  Luk 6:34  And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  Luk 6:35  But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.  Luk 6:36  Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  Luk 6:37  Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:  Luk 6:38  Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.,Take a good look at that. It's not just extreme christian humility. It's a world paradigm of caring and sharing.

Pretty fancy address you have.,It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
David Owens Jeffcoat Read the First Amendment.  It guarantees freedom of religion.  Nowhere is a specific religion mentioned.  Any views to the contrary are unAmerican.,How about safety in schools—oh yeah you said you would send prayers.

Bill Johnson   You can’t be serious. Trump caring about someone else other than himself. Once Trump got elected he stopped worrying about America and it’s people.  He got there votes and that’s all he wanted. This man isn’t concerned about individual people.  It’s just not in his makeup to care for anyone at all,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!

Meanwhile, mainstream news outlets are not reporting that homelessness is “exploding” out on the west coast.  For instance, we are being told that there are “1000's of unauthorized tent camps” in the city of Seattle alone…  Housing prices are soaring here thanks to the tech industry, but the boom comes with a consequence: A surge in homelessness marked by 1000+ unauthorized tent camps in parks, under bridges, on freeway medians and along busy sidewalks. The liberal city is trying to figure out what to do.  But I thought that the Seattle economy was doing so well.  I guess not.  Down in San Diego, they are actually scrubbing the sidewalks with bleach because the growing homeless population is spreading hepatitis A everywhere…  San Diego now scrubs its sidewalks with bleach to counter a deadly hepatitis A outbreak. In Anaheim, 1000+ people sleep along a bike path in the shadow of Angel Stadium. Organizers in Portland lit incense at an outdoor food festival to cover up the stench of urine in a parking lot where vendors set up shop.  Over the past two years, “at least 10 cities or municipal regions in California, Oregon and Washington” have declared a state of emergency because homelessness has gotten so far out of control.  Nice Job Nancy?  Lori Williams posted 1/19/2019-  We have a huge homeless population here in the Antelope Valley, California's high desert. Every under/overpass, vacant field, and any place they can pitch a tent...not to mention store fronts. They're begging in parking lots, gas stations, medians, and even coming into the business where I work. Our homeless shelter closed for lack of funds, and I won't go out after dark anymore. If they do manage to move them, hazmat has to come and clean up after them. But hey, let's allow even more people in that we can't care for, sad.  -------------------- That is all.....,I still don’t want a wall- didn’t 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can’t fool everyone. Open the government !

Whose going to pay for the wall?  https://www.facebook.com/1087167058116488/posts/1188671814632678?sfns=cl,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
Whose going to pay for the wall?  https://www.facebook.com/1087167058116488/posts/1188671814632678?sfns=cl  Trump lied....over and over and over again.  When he said,”I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,” he wasn’t calling you loyal; he was calling you STUPID.,Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.

But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?

Will the wall stop 100% of illegals? No it won't but it will stop a lot and it costs so little that it should be a no brainer.
other country's have tougher laws and enforce them ...in other country's if you steal you get your hand cut off, here you get a slap on the hand... other country's if you kill someone you get put In front of a firing squad,  here you get 20 years of appeals till your unfit for death...see the difference we need stricter laws and to enforce them..,No other country has open borders why should we
yea hopefully god blesses you so you don't get sent to hell....,God Bless you President Trump! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46784315,Robin Bridget Pelosi and Schumer own this one now. They are acting like 2 year olds.
illegal crossing is down to lowest levels in years,Mickey Murcudgeon yes it seems really ridiculous to lock your doors on your house at night? just because we want a wall doesn't mean we're not putting a door in it dumbass.You want to come into the country you do it legally or don't come at all
Heads down!! Incoming liberal bullshit!!!!,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
Rita Abrahamson where are you getting your information?,Rachel- You have proven my point. What we have doesn't work.
Alberto Weisz so why are there still doors at your place then? You still carry a set a keys to get in too???,Are you against the wall? First take the door out of your house and leave everything open.
Bill Johnson never Mr Tromp he don't care for any one .. only for him .. An I a republican an a vet  ..  toll me Tromp return the money of department of education for veterans,Make America Safe Again!!  This President cares about America and it's people!!
Vicki Squires not walk ... Everything is a false .  I Republican an A vet.. an leaved at border line over 25ry.. that is not the way all yours peaplo said..  Now you an all saying .. Hispanic or Latinos they are the only one do crimes.. lest me say in this are the people coming more crimes is white..  the products drugs in the home house.. an cultivate marijuana.. is white..,We can’t continue to let these criminals come into OUR country. Save lives. Build the wall. With the billions we save supporting these welfare bums we can invest in our veterans, aging adults and children.
Özgün Serçe Ergür yes.. ask the Chinese Korean Vietnamese an others that ares ..   What happens whit ISIS crossed from Canada borderline,If you build a wall, illegal immigrants will come with a boat. And boat owners will make huge money by human trafficking, some poor illegal immigrant children will die by drowning, because boat owners will receive more people than the capacity. Another drama will start. Do you really want this? In other countries this is happening. wall is not the solution..
Gary Kane ok, so how many are you willing to house?,NO WALL. Open the government. Stop covering up the CHAOS in your staff and what is happening to you
Borders? Never heard about protected border in EU... Sadly. Maybe some legend from XX years ago.,No other country has open borders why should we
I did? When he said he wanted to run for president!,I did? When he said he wanted to run for president!
Brandon Burgoss you’re kidding right?,President Trump they are breaking the law not protecting our country like they said they would when they took the oath
Michael Pearson And you,sir, are a troll.,I have dedicated & made sacrifices for this country or my county since 1974. Today I am proudly on furlough as my wife & I are sacrificing to support President Trump's efforts to secure the border, one of the main promises upon which we voted him in. The border was relatively secure when my parents (since naturalized & successful business people before retiring) immigrated here during dangerous times before President LBJ created welfare programs. It was a real struggle. If they didn't work--they didn't eat. If they didn't eat, they would die. Period. I say "relatively" because southern border immigrants were humble & respectful workers from mostly Mexico--not massive groups from Central & South America making demands of governments who lured them with give-away programs during Democrat terms.  In recent years while on helicopter patrol between Rivera & Falfurrias I have seen up to 40+ illegal immigrants burst out running from under one mesquite tree.  Unheard of in my previous decades of law enforcement.  Where were Schumer & Pelosi crying in 2013 when I was furloughed two weeks from my Corpus Christi federal job under Obama? And for what cause--to figure out who was going to pay for a national security barrier?  Hell no, but instead to force hard-working Judeo-Christian taxpayers to pay for the socialist issues of Abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the self-destructive pyramid-scheme called Obamacare. THAT shutdown was the real "tantrum," to use Schumer's word from last night's rebuttal. In 2013 I--a former Democrat--was screwed by Democrats because they won their shutdown tantrum.  They created the shutdown, now they can't stand it when their own weapon is used against them.   President Trump, please do not succumb to the emotional screamers. Anyone with my military aircrew survival training can recognize self-serving propaganda tactics of Exaggerate/Fabricate/Saturate.  All manners of border security ARE vital. Anyone with my law enforcement experience knows that you protect your home with multiple layers, not just locked doors, not just a dog, not just a fence, not just security lights, not just cameras, not just a loud alarm, but with a totality of layers which exponentially increases the deterrence factor in a burglar's mind.  Anyone with my CBP experience knows from direct experience that this crisis is real, and unmanageable without enforcement.  President Trump, you are right about the military or federal, long range Predator drones with Radar domes & VADER pods such as the ones we used to launch from Corpus Christi. Fantastic surveillance, being able to detect smugglers/crossers, groups, vehicles & vessels from 20,000 feet day or night.  Yet these or other advanced airborne or ground sensors mean nothing without obstacles, barriers, or boots-on-the-ground to stop or apprehend them. For every effective barrier that is put in place or extended, our limited agents can more efficiently concentrate their efforts in other problem areas.   Great speech last night by President Trump, in the courageous lineage of Presidents John F. Kennedy (Cuban missile crisis) & Ronald Reagan (Libya, Berlin Wall, "The bombing starts in 10 minutes!")  Making America Safe & Strong again.  I know everyone can't share my experiences & direct observations in life where I can speak first hand about these issues, but I feel sorry for people who instead repeat blind rhetoric, without analyzing facts.  Like those who believe the reporters and politicians who, BEFORE THE SPEECH, were saying that it would contain lies. The word for that is "Prejudice" (Pre-Judging).  And worse, from politicians who supported strong borders when someone else was president.  Partisan haters, putting party before national defense.  I remember occasionally having intermediate supervisors like that in county sheriff politics, who if it was not THEIR idea, it was shot down, regardless of how much money it saved or how effectively crime would be decreased.  You cannot impeach a president for hatred or dislike or disagreement, you need articulable crime(s).  Cut the Democrat funds using our tax money for Planned Parenthood to find the money for strong borders.  Show me any other strong, successful nation on earth that has open borders without monstrous taxation?
Wall isn’t going to happen,Mr. President, stand your ground in order to protect our country. Americans are with you.  God bless the USA
He will continue to do nothing for you as well,Thank you Mr President!  Stay strong.  My family is praying for you.
Carl Mörner Trumpcucks get hard off of dead kids.,Well as I understand it the wall is primarily built to stem the rotating flow of 400.000 deportations and illegal entries every year. The berlin wall and the soviet/russian border towards finland required guardtowers,minefields,troops,dogs etc to be efficient.
Oh and dumbass, trump didn’t even win the majority vote.    The wall is even less popular than he is.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
They already are.    They are stopping a dipshit man child from pissing money into a worthless wall to make bigots feel less scared.,Congress,  too,  has  a  responsibility to  the  same.    Look  forward  to  Congress  getting  down  to  work  and  fulfilling  "their"  responsibility.
Danny Jones your culture must be trash.    Why are you garbage humans?,As a UK tax payer I'd much rather we gift you 5 billion for the wall as opposed to giving the EU 39 billion a year to destroy my culture.
No comrade Dave, here in this country we don’t allow the tyrant president to do end runs around congress.    We call that a coup, and we execute people for it.,Executive order. Just do it Mr President
Can’t believe people love this orange lying mentally clown more than they love this country.,Can't believe people hate this President more than they love this Country. Protect your borders now.
But Fox News toldz him dey waz?!,Well, then it is obviously the goal of the democrats to weaken the US from within so that it's easier for them to let in illegal immigrants to vote for them and maintain their power :3
John N Karen Morris yes that is something a fascist cunt would do.  We know how to deal with fascism here.    To report a president that is a Russian asset, support Mueller.,To report a person you think may be in the U.S. illegally, use the Homeland Security Investigations online tip form or call 1-866-347-2423 (in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada) or 1-802-872-6199 (from other countries.
The only thing he should hang for is treason.,Suiter Kaye That’s on Flint, Michigan. That falls under state government. What is your corrupt Democrat run state government doing with your money instead of fixing your drinking water problems? That doesn’t have anything to do with the rest of us. I wouldn’t bring that up if I were you. It doesn’t prove your point.
Keith Webber Jr. of course since Obama never declared one to deny confess, you just proved you are a fucking idiot.    Why do you hate America?,Thank you Obama for setting precedent by declaring 13 emergencies so that we can have a BEAUTIFUL WALL....only good thing he ever did.....
No shock the religious ones are the type of hypocrites that support trump.    He needs a deeply uneducated easy to lie to base.    If you are an adult with imaginary friends, you fit the bill.,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
Border security is not the same thing as a wall.,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
Lisa Mann it would, but Trumpcucks are very very stupid.,Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?
What’s the weather like is Moscow this time of year “Maxine”?,These paid haters are really stupid, Soros needs to cough up a little more money and get some with some brains!
Spoken like a true fascist.    Why do you hate America?,Worley Michael Bwhahahahahahahahaha
Comrade Veronica seems confused.    Trump is Russia’s bitch, they are paying to help him.    Putin doesn’t want his cock holster out of the Oval Office.,Never give in never give up Mr. President hold out for the wall that protects us all
Then why is russia backing Trump?,The Dems don’t want us to be a Strong Nation,, they want Communist rule!!
And Tom has both a limited education and a mental disorder.,Worley Michael you still got nothin.
Aww I think we triggered the little trumpcuck.    Are you afraid that Putin’s cockholster is going down?  I love how Barr duped your dipshit orange clown into thinking he was against Mueller.    You know Mueller is a republican right?  He is just one of the few that still has some balls.,Worley Michael you still got nothin.
You actually think the president can put TVs inside congress?     You really don’t understand how a republic works do you?,Worley Michael You teach us....................the comment expressed a desire to see the anti-security Demos be VISIBLY seen along side (or, underneath) their own public remarks, ON RECORD of their "commitment" to this nation's security.  Probably not on your list of expertise either, but this President just hosted the national champ football team..................founding fathers probably omitted that function....................whadya think?
Wendi DelValle liar.,An illegal immigrant killed my 24 year old brother about a mile from his home. My brother was test driving a motorcycle and the illegal immigrant pulled out in front of him(the man was driving unlicensed and illegally) then left my brother to die on the side of the road. So I support the wall 100%!!
Albert Kojo Kyekye, come here Trump will happily deport you..and if you're not deported you'll pay double In health care..and live paycheck to paycheck...,Eric Wroblewski thank you

Stfu,Build the wall, it's been needed for decades and the politicians, both sides have failed us. We need the wall and it is proven that it works!!!
PAUL HOW ABOUT OUR POLITICIANS WORK TOGETHER AND DO THE BEST FOR THIS COUNTRY AND ITS CITIZENS.....,1 year ago. #msdstrong  How many children die from gun violence? Declare THAT emergency.
Donna Snyder, we have a Coast Guard station where I live along the California Coast along with several military installations. We have a credit union who is offering loans interest-free for those affected, the county animal shelter (no-kill) that's offering free food for pets, and so many other organizations helping those in need.  Ventura County went through two wildfires in two years and is now dealing with heavy rain and flooding. We got through it before and we'll do it again. People will always help.,Stand firm sir. I do wish something could be done for the coast guard service personnel! They have no union benefits
MaryAnn Scandurra, my son is a federal employee and a member of the "border security" Donnie is holding hostage. You know the "border security" he's SO sure our country needs. Ironic, isn't it?,Stand firm sir. I do wish something could be done for the coast guard service personnel! They have no union benefits
Joanne MacEachern, people CLAIM Donnie "doesn't get paid." Where's the proof when he's NEVER shown his tax returns? What's he hiding?,Each member of Congress should NOT be paid their salary and also fined $2000.00 a day the government is in Shutdown
Robbie Miller, no, sweetie, what David Schroeder wrote about the CNN report and Rudy is NOT "Old news." It happened YESTERDAY.   Why are you people so resistant to the truth?,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Susan Scarberry, FACT❗️Obama is NO LONGER IN OFFICE. Try to keep up!  You can't deflect from the deep, deep trouble the man CURRENTLY in the White House finds himself. Scandal after scandal. The name RUSSIA seems to pop up often. WHY?   If President Obama was such a hardened criminal why has the ONLY issue connected to him was paying a fine for errors in campaign records? Not ONE indictment, not ONE conviction and NO ONE from his administration went to prison. Oops!,Thank you, thank you! Don't give in. Stay strong. They are trying to take you down, but we need the wall.
Nadine Weber, do YOU live at the border that you can honestly say "how bad it is"? Seriously! You live in NEBRASKA!!   You people are caught up in hysteria for something that doesn't even AFFECT you. This "border crisis" was created by the man in the White House to deflect from the fact he has RUSSIAN CONNECTIONS!,Tom DeGregorio What a Jerk you are!

Jess Castrejón thats why he donated his salary to studying alcoholism. Action speak louder than words,Drunk driving killed his daughter.. Many Americans drink and drive it’s an American society problem. If you really cared about this guy and his daughter you would address that.

Brian Bray you are absolutely right. Let’s abolish the police because of a few bad apples.,She looks more like a fish.

No, it's about playing for the team not the people.  Chuck and Nancy and many more Dem reps voted for 350+mi boarder wall under Obama but can't do that now because their voter base hates Trump, with a Dem as prez they would build the wall a little at a time like they have been, but stabbing DACA in the back was 100% "playing for the team".,Both sides are afraid you'll fix things, it gives them less to fight about and less to feel 'needed'. Keep it up!
And I'm sure you say the same about Obama? Not to mention chuck and Nancy voted for more wall under Obama then they are being asked for now and you think the wall is what they are holding firm on? They are just saving face and playing for their team which apparently daca is not part of. Way to stab yourselves in the back idiots.,Trump - shameful behavior holding the employees of gov ransom.... just mean spirited
Lol that's why her and chuck voted for over 350mi of boarder wall under Obama and yet won't even take a deal for daca for less then 250mi under Trump right? LMAO you Dems are so stupid you don't even know your own reps voting history and cheer them on as they stab you in the back! 😂  So smart though! Stunning and brave!!!,Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Both chuck and Nancy voted for over 350mi of wall under Obama, the only reason why they didn't take a deal for daca is because they are trying to save face and be "team players".  If Obama was still pres and asking for less then 260mi of wall... Well we already saw how they cast their vote.  All these leftists who think chuck and Nancy are playing for then are dense idiots.,If, this touched Nancy’s family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy’s heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!

Мексика заплатит но не сразу .Путем денежных переводов пошлин и.т.д.,This is all about getting President Trump’s high approval rating down. They can’t allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don’t care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
,Indeed!!! God bless and keep you Mr. President. Thank you!!!
