Danny Jones thank you but since you can give us your Prayers!!  They are better than money!

Can use my tax money to help build a wall

Linda Durbin he should use the money for education because your grammar is atrocious.

"How much insulin could be bought with the wall money to save those who can't afford it...know any diabetics?  How many homeless Veterans could be placed with the wall money?  How many crumbling bridges or roads could be fixed with the wall money?  How many schools and businesses could be protected from gun violence with the wall money. There are far worse emergencies in America today

Apple Rivera don't waste this countrys money

Simon Kitson I guess posing nude and marrying for money makes you smart

Tommy Carpenter money .

Charlesetta Brown Printing money every day was so easy for him...

Keith Webber Jr. Many National Emergencies were called prior to President Obama (why you all bring up Obama and Clinton all the time...get over them...focus on now)...but did Obama want to take money from the military or drug intervention programs? Trump himself ...in the Rose Garden... said..after he declared a National Emergency....he didn't need to do this now.

Can I just get my tax money back that you stole let the family deal with their own problem they aren’t worried about who killed my family member

"Mary Larkin American people will receive a smaller refund this year after filing their income tax returns. The Republican/Trump tax cuts is a big scam that only benefits the rich. That's all Paul Ryan wanted; he got it and ran away.    “Lower tax refunds might hurt the economy. If Americans are getting less money back

Hal Eric Mitlitsky  you are obviously not keeping up with the news.  No collusion.  Just 2 years of wasted money and time because Dems can’t accept Hillary’s defeat

You show me in the Constitution where it states you can not use money to protect the US citizens

Its against the constitution by using money from the treasury

Austin Baker he’s using the death to push for his border wall which he INCLUDES in the headline.   EXCEPT a wall will do nothing for illegal immigration. They overstay their visas or come in with forged documents. The ACTUAL drugs and crime come through vehicles through legal ports of entry.   He’s not asking you to pay for immigration suppression but an entire waste of money that’s more symbolic of America than it is an effective tools

Try taking a good look at the northern border.  No wall.  Other methods. Terrific security.  And they aren't working on stopping poor terrified people trying to get away from conflicts we are partly responsible for...they are trying to make sure nobody gets to us through them and pulls another 9/11.  This wall is a waste of money.

Keith Webber Jr. While he takes the money from the military infrastructure budget which will cause our military families to suffer more than they do now in housing that is falling apart. Pendejo!

"If you’re going to be spending that much money on building a wall

Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?

"No because the money set aside for Homeland Security in the future will only be raided by Democrats and used on welfare

The Mexican drug cartels have a lot of money and they know how to invest it to maximize their illegal profits. During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.  Is it possible that cartel money is now being used to change public opinion and the politicians opinions on the construction of the border wall between Mexico and the United States? I am just wondering now……

"How come we can give Israel money to the tune of around $3 Billion annually and they are using some of that money to build walls and none of our politicians complain about how they're ""wasting money on walls"" in Israel?? The U.S. is partially funding those walls along with the Iron Dome anti-missile system! Yet not one word about the walls in Israel from Schumer or Pelosi!!!! They are 2 hypocrites!

lol Mexico isn’t paying  Americans tax money is paying for the wall

Anthony Boites they believe that make money will come from Mexico

The aid not sent to Pakistan will help pay for the wall  that is money well spent

All that money going to that wall could help people who can't afford health care who need assistance with mention health

"Kimberly Mansfield compare those killed in mass shooting per year to the number killed by illegal aliens every year.     As for money to help people

Kimberly Mansfield  get rid of illegals and hey there a whole lot of extra money for mental health

"There are too many innocent people being murdered every day and if you look at it long and hard you can see that it all is happening because there is no border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.  Weather it is from their drugs laced with fentanyl or weapons they brought with them or illegal immigrants who think the laws do not exist or pertain to them.  Build the wall and make them come through legally and catch the drugs and weapons at the port of entry!  We can't take care of our own.  Why are we still taking care of them.  The money it takes to build the wall will be cheaper in the long run from the money we save from Narcon used to save drug attics

"dems voted for money to other countries 

"Build it Mr. President. For those saying think of what that money could do for vets and homeless

We support you and fully agree with you!!! Build that wall because Congress and the Democrats don't know how the rest of us live and go through. The rest of us don't have a security detail or the money to invest in high quality security systems.

Build the wall the government has money for whatever else they want

What he means is had he been given the money the State Of Emergency wouldn't have been necessary.

The constitution clearly states that congress controls the purse strings.   This has not been a priority for either parties since the inauguration in 2017.    Congress does not give the executive branch money.     https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-constitution-and-the-federal-budget-process/

Justin Fox oh but the money could be used in so many other places.  Let’s start in Flint for water for the people. Shall we?

Petion is online to impeach Pelosi and Schumer!! Sign it!!The wall needs to be built! Charity starts at home! Take care of our citizens first then help others! We give money to many countries billions start here first!!!

The spending bill should not have been signed. Too much money to support illegals and restricting where the wall is built.

Temicka Brown That's what the Dems did with the money Trump gave

We are spending so much money on illegal immigrants that a wall may not be such a bad idea at first I was pretty much against it but all the drugs are killing g so many people not to mention these immigrants get everything for free using taxpayers dollars yes maybe the money should be spent to help drug addiction or homeless or vets maybe we should have stricter laws for immigrants coming into this country I don’t know if the wall will help but something has to give.  This country was built on immigrants only native Americans are Native American Indians but if u want to come to this country you should have to take the proper steps and come legally. My parents were legal immigrants and they never took any money from the government for help.  I’m hoping that Trump is right and wall will help I just pray for unity and peace in our country

"Bush gave the MONEY for the damn wall

No one talks about the money spent for land purchased by the prior administration for the border wall.

#BUILDTHEWALL #PRESIDENTTRUMP use El Chapos seized money #THANKSELCHAPO

We can't build the wall with our tax money because that's socialism! Let's make Amazon or Walmart or one of the big oil companies build it... about time they pay us back for all the subsidies they get.

EVEN IF IT MEANS THE DEMS WON'T GET THEIR PACK OF MONEY FROM THE SOUTH.

Betsy Hammond How much would the money HUSSAIN  SENT TO IRAN BUY????

Do we our money eith our family .Do far our kids social security  benefit has used during Obama era for eight years  .we get any thing .

Does anyone not think that the Democrats are corrupt and making money from groups that profit from the illegal immigrants and drug smuggling coming across the border?

Hayden Blair sueing is just going to tie up the funds I didn't say he wouldn't get the money. Moving the bases and starting training exercises would just be a cheaper  option that would get us a more effective boarder control almost immediately. He would still build the wall as funds became available  And would make the wall more secure even after it was built

Take the money from El Capo and get it built!  Thanks

Stopping drugs at our ports and better tracking expired visas works better. Get El Chapo (Great Idea Ted Cruz) to pay for the wall and put that money into port security and visa tracking. Most bang for the buck.

Why not put the army at the bordee that money can be spend much better or wiser

Agreed.  Democrats want to rebel but how much money Oblamma give Iran?

Betsy Hammond:How much money do you think could be put towards these issues if not for the billions of dollars spent on illegal immigrants.

Just shows our politicians only care about power and money. Donald can only be in office for 4 more years then it's back to the same old.

am against the wall it's a waste of time and money American please lean to love one another forgive less enjoy the life

"Oh I can yes. But if we're an illegal who starts his own business and hires other illegals.... Or if you are a home owner looking for cheap labor because your don't make the most money in the the world. Then you hire a guy of Mexican decent but he speaks good English. Only to find his ""work"" is shabby at best and that that man is not even legally here...."

"If Democrats are smart they would just give him the money he wants. Now that he's moved on this and the fact this is such a polarizing subject

I think we are very naive if we  think this wall will stopp immigrants ! Use this money instead to help people in US that need help !

It's a STUPID argument...  it doesn't matter if the WALL is the most perfect deterrent - it's worth trying as part of border security.  What's the big deal about the money for the wall? Trump will have saved that much and more with his trade deals.  #buildthewall

Thank god!! about time!! I would pay for the wall myself if i had the money!!!

Look at the stats on how many Americans were killed by guns. It's far higher than illegal immigrants but you won't touch gun control because they fund your campaign. It's always about the money with you.

"YES! Build the wall! The democrats in power could care less about the citizens of our country. For them it is all about money

"Your pain doesn’t equate to spending my money. Your feelings have nothing to do with me or my state

To all the people that want illegals in this country sponsor one put your money where your big-ass mouth is

Tudy Anderson Latulip a wall will not stop the illegal handouts and instantly relocate that money to vets. A wall will take decades to build and vets should not have to wait.

Illegal immigration is at a 10 year low and there is no extra money going towards vets.

Lord have mercy Irene Roberts! Yoi better open your mind. My question was not what is it. He has lied to you and told you that he has started. Nope. Where did the money come from ? Where is it? When did he start? He Is Lying To You. Point blank period. Of it is the truth you should be able to answer the what when and where. Believe in the truth. Sorry that is all I'm telling you. I don't care if you believe me.

If it happens to them they would change their tune. The rich and powerful who are against the wall for safety have all the protection their money can buy. Unfortunately the average person doesn’t

Gary Busenbark You do it Troll. Spend Money for the Wall you have got  1000$ of Taxreturn give it to Idiot45.

Stop their money & benefits too

"BUILD IT NOW...I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHERE THE MONEY HAS TO COME FROM...GET IT AND USE IT ON THE WALL!!! PEOPLE CAN COME IN THE ""OLD FASHION"" WAY...LEGALLY!!!"

Democrats care about the flag (keep it holy) guns (keep'em close by) God (use his name often) and acquiring money by any means. Oh yea I meant republicans

Nope! You get no money for a wall. There is no wall.... #Not1Dollar #Not1Brick

Take all the security away from Congress. They forget who they work for. Remind them we the people are their employers. Use their security money to  BUILD DAT WALL!!!

What about all the school shootings by Americans? Those just don’t matter? One problem by an illegal immigrant and that’s your excuse?? A lot of worse things happen and they’re not caused by the people you’re blaming. You’re doing more damage to the country. Money doesn’t make you any smarter..

This is to sad how many deaths of American Citizens need to happen and how much money do we need to give illegals before democrats wake up and realize without the wall Americans aren't as safe and are suffering the consequences of the Democratic decisons.. #AmericaFirst #BuildTheWall

You are spending all this money on a ridiculous wall yet we have bridges and tunnels that are going to start failing. You are an idiot. Ann Coulter is right.

"HELLO.......they comes here for FREE (which we pay for) perks.  Stop all the freebies and they will quit coming right away.  Charge a hefty fee for sending money to a foreign country and walla

The reason liberals and some so called republicans are so mad is because up until now every president since Reagan has given just enough money for a small section of wall to keep enough voters happy to keep getting re-elected. The liberals don’t want the wall because it will keep their base from growing and ruin their idea of a world without borders. The republicans are afraid they are gonna upset the moderates and independents. We finally have a president that is serious about securing our country.

"YOU ARE A FREAKING LIAR.. There's No wall being built.  What you are doing is lying to Republicans.  The wall you are claiming to be built is just being REPAIRED and you Mr. Trump are pulling money from various departments from govt agencies to help fund an ALREADY BUILT border wall.  NOT AN INCH OF A NEW WALL IS BUILT.  LIAR👎 LIAR👎 LIAR👎 LIAR👎.        How can contractors build a wall with no blueprint or plan. Yes

Trump has done nothing but spread hate and divide this country.the big tax break was for the rich and 72% of Americans will have to pay back money. Did you know the rich don't have to pay federal taxes? The rich take care of each other.  Trump is not taking any pay for being a President because its being made up by all the extra money from his tax break. I didn't say he wasn't stupid.

and yesterday a US citizen killed five people and a year ago 17....and everyday citizens are killed by guns....why aren't they as important as this girl? Why are you not asking for money to address the real concerns in the US?

Tax all the money that is sent out of the country via remittance.  Just a 40% tax on that money should pay for the wall quite easily.

Its good to know that banning immigrants will stop drunk driving.   I guess MADD spent money for decades for nothing.

"Fully support Donald Trump The safety and prosperity of the United States is above all ""We need a safe wall"" The Democratic Party will pay for this wall construction project I say Democrats will have to spend money on this wall 😎😎😎  ""The United States needs security

"Build the wall. Move on. Use “drug money” held in escrow. These drug lords are in jail

Notice how he was asking for 21 billion to build the entire wall but only got 1.3 billion from the democrats so he declared a national emergency allocating 8 more billion but everyone is telling him to use El Chapos 14 billion? 14+8+1.3=23.3 billion to build the entire wall. I think trump just got his money to build the wall.

So mr. Krabs you can't make money off everything through contracts and contractors that build the wall after your fake presidencies up .

If you want the wall pitch in your money to pay for it. Kind of a socialist thing to demand we pay for a wall the majority don’t want or need.

Bullshit as usual the wall will definitely not work waste of money

Proud of our president he has been the one in only president who has made us promise's and has being true us the people of the United State's he has fault hard to get his promise's done and work's so hard around twenty hour's a day and is not except no pay for his hard work and you show me another president that would do this he is a caring person and he Love's the people of American if he wasn't then he would not try to help us and this is for our protection and to keep all the people that don't care if we live or die and how may president who has took and raised so much money and help our Veterans that has been looked over for many of year's now and they was left with out a home to live in and not the right medical treatment and our men and women in uniforms were over looked also and would let the Illegal come in the United State's and have more then us the people of the United State's would ever be able to get and me live here they should not be able to come over here and get the best of living and get to live in our houses when we have so many homeless people who live here and get no help when they can walk right in or country and have first choice on any thing we got it is pass the time we put a stop to it our people that live here and belong's here should have the choice over the people that don't belong here and they pay them to come over and live here for free and take away from us the American we have more people live's here now then need's to be here.i am proud of our president and I stand up for him and we pray for him daily and we pray for protection of our president and Vice President and all the family's who work in the White House along our president .

Some of the points on here are good ones. But the big point that some don't want to see. If we was not spending billions and billions a year on illegals. That would be money that could be used to help people with medical issues. Help vets. Help the homeless. We are spending billions a year on people who have not brought so much as a soda pop In this country. As for the water in Michigan. It was a problem long before trump was elected. If the voters in Michigan would quit voting the same people in that got them in this mess. Just maybe things would get fixed. Your water problems are controlled by your local government not the president.

IF THE 5 PRESIDENTS BEFORE TRUMP HAD USED THE MONEY ALLOCATED FOR THE WALL MAYBE THEIR DAUGHTER WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY..............

Dawn Duff what is pointless is spending over 100 billion dollars a year of taxpayer money on people that have no legal right to be here.  Why aren't you crying about sending billions of OUR tax dollars to Jordan to build THEIR pointless wall?

ll that money Obama sent to Iran could have payed for the wall . And the money was already aproved years ago and where did it go.

if it was your highest priority you would address internal gun violence.  you are a blowhard and a dimwit.  if it wasn't for daddy's money you would starve.

What a waste of money...... Wake up folks!

Mexico. Mexico. Mexico? Why are they not paying? A half filled promise that now must be footed by American taxpayers. Trump has failed.  We have a huge bloated deficit. Big spender of other people’s money.

U covered up the rape of a 4 year old girl by officer Jose Nunez. U covered up the rape of a 4 year old girl. U protected a child molester. All u care about is money. U say and do anything as long as it fits your agenda.  #TrumpIsABitch

Walls don't work......they just start digging using fake documents or boats wall is waste of money simple maths says war on drugs has never been won probably never will

Veronica Torres are toy even paying attention to hope much money the trump family is making off this presidency...I do respect your opinion but facts are facts

I don't understand why President Trump did not declare this an emergency two years ago when he could have done more and got more money without a fight? Now it will be the Democrats fault and his base will fall in line with that🐑 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑 like mindless sheep

Use the Drug Cartels money to build  the Wall!Amen +++🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😊😊😊🙏🙏😎😎😎

You want reroute wall money to help US citizens? How about we reroute the billions we give illegals instead. How about the billions sent abroad to our so called allies?  Im pretty sure there are tons of dollars wasted on non citizens every day. Why take away our shot at securing the border?

Reading thru these comments i can very well see why this country is in the shape its in .heres a man trying to make this country better and theres people on here acting like spoiled kids that refuse to admit hes doing a good job .its not just about killing or drugs or rape or draining our benefits programs .putting our hospitals in financial problems .drunk driving or even working and sending the money back to mexico and other places its all these and more .money that could help seniors .vets kids .drug addicts .single parents and to try and fix our health ins issues are going for  these illegals .not to mention so called border security.

Build the wall. Start a go fund me page. Let’s get that money and build it.

After living near the border and knowing people who worked for border patrol it would be wiser to bring the military home and put them on the border and get rid of the bad border patrol  !  He would win on two fronts bringing military home and saving money because they are home and can be near families and it would be better then the wall.  They should sell all majuana  to place selling it legally to raise money for wall and anyone bringing hard drugs should face a firing squad that will stop drugs and he would be re-elected.

"Tony Lamb .org  I HAD A DREAM!   I have had many end times dreams.   In my dreams I saw the destruction of America. America (Babylon) is Entering Judgement.  I saw nuclear weapons going off in most major American cities. I saw two Asteroids hit the earth. One of these Asteroids caused a Tsunami that was several hundred feet high to hit America's East coast. I saw A mega-earthquake on the west coast that caused two other faults to rip wide open causing another massive Tsunami on the West Coast. Then these earthquakes caused several major Volcanoes to erupt. I saw America ripped in half by the New Madrid fault ripping America in half from the Great Lakes down to New Orleans and this was up to hundreds of miles wide at some points.  America's heartland was turned into a great sea between two continents. And yes I saw Yellowstone erupt with a massive eruption. I was above the earth witnessing all this. But then I zoomed down and in close and I saw civil war in America. I saw Americans shooting and bombing other American's. I saw paper money blowing down the street and no one gave it a thought as it was worthless paper.  Everyone was starving and people were eating bugs

Austin Baker he’s using the death to push for his border wall which he INCLUDES in the headline.   EXCEPT a wall will do nothing for illegal immigration. They overstay their visas or come in with forged documents. The ACTUAL drugs and crime come through vehicles through legal ports of entry.   He’s not asking you to pay for immigration suppression but an entire waste of money that’s more symbolic of America than it is an effective tools

Try taking a good look at the northern border.  No wall.  Other methods. Terrific security.  And they aren't working on stopping poor terrified people trying to get away from conflicts we are partly responsible for...they are trying to make sure nobody gets to us through them and pulls another 9/11.  This wall is a waste of money.

Keith Webber Jr. While he takes the money from the military infrastructure budget which will cause our military families to suffer more than they do now in housing that is falling apart. Pendejo!

"If you’re going to be spending that much money on building a wall

Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?

"No because the money set aside for Homeland Security in the future will only be raided by Democrats and used on welfare

The Mexican drug cartels have a lot of money and they know how to invest it to maximize their illegal profits. During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.  Is it possible that cartel money is now being used to change public opinion and the politicians opinions on the construction of the border wall between Mexico and the United States? I am just wondering now……

lol Mexico isn’t paying  Americans tax money is paying for the wall

Anthony Boites they believe that make money will come from Mexico

The aid not sent to Pakistan will help pay for the wall  that is money well spent

All that money going to that wall could help people who can't afford health care who need assistance with mention health

"Kimberly Mansfield compare those killed in mass shooting per year to the number killed by illegal aliens every year.     As for money to help people

"There are too many innocent people being murdered every day and if you look at it long and hard you can see that it all is happening because there is no border wall to keep illegal immigrants out.

"Build it Mr. President. For those saying think of what that money could do for vets and homeless

We support you and fully agree with you!!! Build that wall because Congress and the Democrats don't know how the rest of us live and go through. The rest of us don't have a security detail or the money to invest in high quality security systems.

Build the wall the government has money for whatever else they want

What he means is had he been given the money the State Of Emergency wouldn't have been necessary.

The constitution clearly states that congress controls the purse strings.   This has not been a priority for either parties since the inauguration in 2017.    Congress does not give the executive branch money.     https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-constitution-and-the-federal-budget-process/

Justin Fox oh but the money could be used in so many other places.  Let’s start in Flint for water for the people. Shall we?

Petion is online to impeach Pelosi and Schumer!! Sign it!!The wall needs to be built! Charity starts at home! Take care of our citizens first then help others! We give money to many countries billions start here first!!!

The spending bill should not have been signed. Too much money to support illegals and restricting where the wall is built.

Temicka Brown That's what the Dems did with the money Trump gave

We are spending so much money on illegal immigrants that a wall may not be such a bad idea at first I was pretty much against it but all the drugs are killing g so many people not to mention these immigrants get everything for free using taxpayers dollars yes maybe the money should be spent to help drug addiction or homeless or vets maybe we should have stricter laws for immigrants coming into this country I don’t know if the wall will help but something has to give.  This country was built on immigrants only native Americans are Native American Indians but if u want to come to this country you should have to take the proper steps and come legally.

No one talks about the money spent for land purchased by the prior administration for the border wall.

#BUILDTHEWALL #PRESIDENTTRUMP use El Chapos seized money #THANKSELCHAPO

We can't build the wall with our tax money because that's socialism! Let's make Amazon or Walmart or one of the big oil companies build it... about time they pay us back for all the subsidies they get.

EVEN IF IT MEANS THE DEMS WON'T GET THEIR PACK OF MONEY FROM THE SOUTH.

Betsy Hammond How much would the money HUSSAIN  SENT TO IRAN BUY????

Do we our money eith our family .Do far our kids social security  benefit has used during Obama era for eight years  .we get any thing .

Does anyone not think that the Democrats are corrupt and making money from groups that profit from the illegal immigrants and drug smuggling coming across the border?

Hayden Blair sueing is just going to tie up the funds I didn't say he wouldn't get the money. Moving the bases and starting training exercises would just be a cheaper  option that would get us a more effective boarder control almost immediately. He would still build the wall as funds became available  And would make the wall more secure even after it was built

Take the money from El Capo and get it built!  Thanks

Stopping drugs at our ports and better tracking expired visas works better. Get El Chapo (Great Idea Ted Cruz) to pay for the wall and put that money into port security and visa tracking. Most bang for the buck.

Why not put the army at the bordee that money can be spend much better or wiser

Agreed.  Democrats want to rebel but how much money Oblamma give Iran?

Betsy Hammond:How much money do you think could be put towards these issues if not for the billions of dollars spent on illegal immigrants.

Just shows our politicians only care about power and money. Donald can only be in office for 4 more years then it's back to the same old.

am against the wall it's a waste of time and money American please lean to love one another forgive less enjoy the life

"Oh I can yes. But if we're an illegal who starts his own business and hires other illegals.... Or if you are a home owner looking for cheap labor because your don't make the most money in the the world. Then you hire a guy of Mexican decent but he speaks good English. Only to find his ""work"" is shabby at best and that that man is not even legally here...."

"If Democrats are smart they would just give him the money he wants. Now that he's moved on this and the fact this is such a polarizing subject

I think we are very naive if we  think this wall will stopp immigrants ! Use this money instead to help people in US that need help !

It's a STUPID argument...  it doesn't matter if the WALL is the most perfect deterrent - it's worth trying as part of border security.  What's the big deal about the money for the wall? Trump will have saved that much and more with his trade deals.  #buildthewall

Thank god!! about time!! I would pay for the wall myself if i had the money!!!

Look at the stats on how many Americans were killed by guns. It's far higher than illegal immigrants but you won't touch gun control because they fund your campaign. It's always about the money with you.

"YES! Build the wall! The democrats in power could care less about the citizens of our country. For them it is all about money

"Your pain doesn’t equate to spending my money. Your feelings have nothing to do with me or my state

To all the people that want illegals in this country sponsor one put your money where your big-ass mouth is

Tudy Anderson Latulip a wall will not stop the illegal handouts and instantly relocate that money to vets. A wall will take decades to build and vets should not have to wait.

Illegal immigration is at a 10 year low and there is no extra money going towards vets.

Lord have mercy Irene Roberts! Yoi better open your mind. My question was not what is it. He has lied to you and told you that he has started. Nope. Where did the money come from ? Where is it? When did he start? He Is Lying To You. Point blank period. Of it is the truth you should be able to answer the what when and where. Believe in the truth. Sorry that is all I'm telling you. I don't care if you believe me.

If it happens to them they would change their tune. The rich and powerful who are against the wall for safety have all the protection their money can buy. Unfortunately the average person doesn’t

Gary Busenbark You do it Troll. Spend Money for the Wall you have got  1000$ of Taxreturn give it to Idiot45.

Stop their money & benefits too

"BUILD IT NOW...I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHERE THE MONEY HAS TO COME FROM...GET IT AND USE IT ON THE WALL!!! PEOPLE CAN COME IN THE ""OLD FASHION"" WAY...LEGALLY!!!"

Democrats care about the flag (keep it holy) guns (keep'em close by) God (use his name often) and acquiring money by any means. Oh yea I meant republicans

Nope! You get no money for a wall. There is no wall.... #Not1Dollar #Not1Brick

Take all the security away from Congress. They forget who they work for. Remind them we the people are their employers. Use their security money to  BUILD DAT WALL!!!

What about all the school shootings by Americans? Those just don’t matter? One problem by an illegal immigrant and that’s your excuse?? A lot of worse things happen and they’re not caused by the people you’re blaming. You’re doing more damage to the country. Money doesn’t make you any smarter..

You are spending all this money on a ridiculous wall yet we have bridges and tunnels that are going to start failing. You are an idiot. Ann Coulter is right.

"HELLO.......they comes here for FREE (which we pay for) perks.  Stop all the freebies and they will quit coming right away.  Charge a hefty fee for sending money to a foreign country and walla

The reason liberals and some so called republicans are so mad is because up until now every president since Reagan has given just enough money for a small section of wall to keep enough voters happy to keep getting re-elected. The liberals don’t want the wall because it will keep their base from growing and ruin their idea of a world without borders. The republicans are afraid they are gonna upset the moderates and independents. We finally have a president that is serious about securing our country.

"YOU ARE A FREAKING LIAR.. There's No wall being built.  What you are doing is lying to Republicans.  The wall you are claiming to be built is just being REPAIRED and you Mr. Trump are pulling money from various departments from govt agencies to help fund an ALREADY BUILT border wall.  NOT AN INCH OF A NEW WALL IS BUILT.  LIAR👎 LIAR👎 LIAR👎 LIAR👎.        How can contractors build a wall with no blueprint or plan. Yes

Trump has done nothing but spread hate and divide this country.the big tax break was for the rich and 72% of Americans will have to pay back money. Did you know the rich don't have to pay federal taxes? The rich take care of each other.  Trump is not taking any pay for being a President because its being made up by all the extra money from his tax break. I didn't say he wasn't stupid.

Tax all the money that is sent out of the country via remittance.  Just a 40% tax on that money should pay for the wall quite easily.

Notice how he was asking for 21 billion to build the entire wall but only got 1.3 billion from the democrats so he declared a national emergency allocating 8 more billion but everyone is telling him to use El Chapos 14 billion? 14+8+1.3=23.3 billion to build the entire wall. I think trump just got his money to build the wall.

We are spending so much money on illegal immigrants that a wall may not be such a bad idea at first I was pretty much against it but all the drugs are killing g so many people not to mention these immigrants get everything for free using taxpayers dollars yes maybe the money should be spent to help drug addiction or homeless or vets maybe we should have stricter laws for immigrants coming into this country I don’t know if the wall will help but something has to give.  This country was built on immigrants only native Americans are Native American Indians but if u want to come to this country you should have to take the proper steps and come legally. My parents were legal immigrants and they never took any money from the government for help.  I’m hoping that Trump is right and wall will help I just pray for unity and peace in our country

"Bush gave the MONEY for the damn wall

No one talks about the money spent for land purchased by the prior administration for the border wall.

#BUILDTHEWALL #PRESIDENTTRUMP use El Chapos seized money #THANKSELCHAPO

We can't build the wall with our tax money because that's socialism! Let's make Amazon or Walmart or one of the big oil companies build it... about time they pay us back for all the subsidies they get.

EVEN IF IT MEANS THE DEMS WON'T GET THEIR PACK OF MONEY FROM THE SOUTH.

Betsy Hammond How much would the money HUSSAIN  SENT TO IRAN BUY????

Do we our money eith our family .Do far our kids social security  benefit has used during Obama era for eight years  .we get any thing .

Does anyone not think that the Democrats are corrupt and making money from groups that profit from the illegal immigrants and drug smuggling coming across the border?

Take the money from El Capo and get it built!  Thanks

Stopping drugs at our ports and better tracking expired visas works better. Get El Chapo (Great Idea Ted Cruz) to pay for the wall and put that money into port security and visa tracking. Most bang for the buck.

Agreed.  Democrats want to rebel but how much money Oblamma give Iran?

Betsy Hammond:How much money do you think could be put towards these issues if not for the billions of dollars spent on illegal immigrants.

Just shows our politicians only care about power and money. Donald can only be in office for 4 more years then it's back to the same old.

am against the wall it's a waste of time and money American please lean to love one another forgive less enjoy the life

I think we are very naive if we  think this wall will stopp immigrants ! Use this money instead to help people in US that need help !

It's a STUPID argument...  it doesn't matter if the WALL is the most perfect deterrent - it's worth trying as part of border security.  What's the big deal about the money for the wall? Trump will have saved that much and more with his trade deals.  #buildthewall

Thank god!! about time!! I would pay for the wall myself if i had the money!!!

Look at the stats on how many Americans were killed by guns. It's far higher than illegal immigrants but you won't touch gun control because they fund your campaign. It's always about the money with you.

"YES! Build the wall! The democrats in power could care less about the citizens of our country. For them it is all about money

"Your pain doesn’t equate to spending my money. Your feelings have nothing to do with me or my state

If it happens to them they would change their tune. The rich and powerful who are against the wall for safety have all the protection their money can buy. Unfortunately the average person doesn’t

Stop their money & benefits too

Danny Jones thank you but since you can give us your Prayers!!  They are better than money!

Can use my tax money to help build a wall

Linda Durbin he should use the money for education because your grammar is atrocious.

Austin Baker he’s using the death to push for his border wall which he INCLUDES in the headline.   EXCEPT a wall will do nothing for illegal immigration. They overstay their visas or come in with forged documents. The ACTUAL drugs and crime come through vehicles through legal ports of entry.   He’s not asking you to pay for immigration suppression but an entire waste of money that’s more symbolic of America than it is an effective tools

Try taking a good look at the northern border.  No wall.  Other methods. Terrific security.  And they aren't working on stopping poor terrified people trying to get away from conflicts we are partly responsible for...they are trying to make sure nobody gets to us through them and pulls another 9/11.  This wall is a waste of money.

Keith Webber Jr. While he takes the money from the military infrastructure budget which will cause our military families to suffer more than they do now in housing that is falling apart. Pendejo!

"If you’re going to be spending that much money on building a wall

Ok I have nothing against the wall being built but they will find away to get over it or under it. Wouldn't it make more sense to use that money and up our Homeland security?

"No because the money set aside for Homeland Security in the future will only be raided by Democrats and used on welfare

The Mexican drug cartels have a lot of money and they know how to invest it to maximize their illegal profits. During the national discussion in this country about legalizing marijuana it was suspected that a large amount of cartel money went into swaying public opinion away from the legalization.  Is it possible that cartel money is now being used to change public opinion and the politicians opinions on the construction of the border wall between Mexico and the United States? I am just wondering now……

We support you and fully agree with you!!! Build that wall because Congress and the Democrats don't know how the rest of us live and go through. The rest of us don't have a security detail or the money to invest in high quality security systems.

Build the wall the government has money for whatever else they want

What he means is had he been given the money the State Of Emergency wouldn't have been necessary.

The constitution clearly states that congress controls the purse strings.   This has not been a priority for either parties since the inauguration in 2017.    Congress does not give the executive branch money.     https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-constitution-and-the-federal-budget-process/

Hayden Blair sueing is just going to tie up the funds I didn't say he wouldn't get the money.

Illegal immigration is at a 10 year low and there is no extra money going towards vets.

Nope! You get no money for a wall. There is no wall.... #Not1Dollar #Not1Brick

Take all the security away from Congress. They forget who they work for. Remind them we the people are their employers. Use their security money to  BUILD DAT WALL!!!

What about all the school shootings by Americans? Those just don’t matter? One problem by an illegal immigrant and that’s your excuse?? A lot of worse things happen and they’re not caused by the people you’re blaming. You’re doing more damage to the country. Money doesn’t make you any smarter..

You are spending all this money on a ridiculous wall yet we have bridges and tunnels that are going to start failing. You are an idiot. Ann Coulter is right.

"HELLO.......they comes here for FREE (which we pay for) perks.  Stop all the freebies and they will quit coming right away.  Charge a hefty fee for sending money to a foreign country and walla

The reason liberals and some so called republicans are so mad is because up until now every president since Reagan has given just enough money for a small section of wall to keep enough voters happy to keep getting re-elected. The liberals don’t want the wall because it will keep their base from growing and ruin their idea of a world without borders. The republicans are afraid they are gonna upset the moderates and independents. We finally have a president that is serious about securing our country.

"YOU ARE A FREAKING LIAR.. There's No wall being built.  What you are doing is lying to Republicans.  The wall you are claiming to be built is just being REPAIRED and you Mr. Trump are pulling money from various departments from govt agencies to help fund an ALREADY BUILT border wall.  NOT AN INCH OF A NEW WALL IS BUILT.  LIAR👎 LIAR👎 LIAR👎 LIAR👎.        How can contractors build a wall with no blueprint or plan. Yes

Trump has done nothing but spread hate and divide this country.the big tax break was for the rich and 72% of Americans will have to pay back money. Did you know the rich don't have to pay federal taxes? The rich take care of each other.  Trump is not taking any pay for being a President because its being made up by all the extra money from his tax break. I didn't say he wasn't stupid.

and yesterday a US citizen killed five people and a year ago 17....and everyday citizens are killed by guns....why aren't they as important as this girl? Why are you not asking for money to address the real concerns in the US?

Tax all the money that is sent out of the country via remittance.  Just a 40% tax on that money should pay for the wall quite easily.

Notice how he was asking for 21 billion to build the entire wall but only got 1.3 billion from the democrats so he declared a national emergency allocating 8 more billion but everyone is telling him to use El Chapos 14 billion? 14+8+1.3=23.3 billion to build the entire wall. I think trump just got his money to build the wall.

So mr. Krabs you can't make money off everything through contracts and contractors that build the wall after your fake presidencies up .

If you want the wall pitch in your money to pay for it. Kind of a socialist thing to demand we pay for a wall the majority don’t want or need.

Bullshit as usual the wall will definitely not work waste of money

Proud of our president he has been the one in only president who has made us promise's and has being true us the people of the United State's he has fault hard to get his promise's done and work's so hard around twenty hour's a day and is not except no pay for his hard work and you show me another president that would do this he is a caring person and he Love's the people of American if he wasn't then he would not try to help us and this is for our protection and to keep all the people that don't care if we live or die and how may president who has took and raised so much money and help our Veterans that has been looked over for many of year's now and they was left with out a home to live in and not the right medical treatment and our men and women in uniforms were over looked also and would let the Illegal come in the United State's and have more then us the people of the United State's would ever be able to get and me live here they should not be able to come over here and get the best of living and get to live in our houses when we have so many homeless people who live here and get no help when they can walk right in or country and have first choice on any thing we got it is pass the time we put a stop to it our people that live here and belong's here should have the choice over the people that don't belong here and they pay them to come over and live here for free and take away from us the American we have more people live's here now then need's to be here.i am proud of our president and I stand up for him and we pray for him daily and we pray for protection of our president and Vice President and all the family's who work in the White House along our president .

Some of the points on here are good ones. But the big point that some don't want to see. If we was not spending billions and billions a year on illegals. That would be money that could be used to help people with medical issues. Help vets. Help the homeless. We are spending billions a year on people who have not brought so much as a soda pop In this country. As for the water in Michigan. It was a problem long before trump was elected. If the voters in Michigan would quit voting the same people in that got them in this mess. Just maybe things would get fixed. Your water problems are controlled by your local government not the president.

IF THE 5 PRESIDENTS BEFORE TRUMP HAD USED THE MONEY ALLOCATED FOR THE WALL MAYBE THEIR DAUGHTER WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY..............

Dawn Duff what is pointless is spending over 100 billion dollars a year of taxpayer money on people that have no legal right to be here.  Why aren't you crying about sending billions of OUR tax dollars to Jordan to build THEIR pointless wall?

ll that money Obama sent to Iran could have payed for the wall . And the money was already aproved years ago and where did it go.

if it was your highest priority you would address internal gun violence.  you are a blowhard and a dimwit.  if it wasn't for daddy's money you would starve.

What a waste of money...... Wake up folks!

Mexico. Mexico. Mexico? Why are they not paying? A half filled promise that now must be footed by American taxpayers. Trump has failed.  We have a huge bloated deficit. Big spender of other people’s money.

U covered up the rape of a 4 year old girl by officer Jose Nunez. U covered up the rape of a 4 year old girl. U protected a child molester. All u care about is money. U say and do anything as long as it fits your agenda.  #TrumpIsABitch

Walls don't work......they just start digging using fake documents or boats wall is waste of money simple maths says war on drugs has never been won probably never will

Veronica Torres are toy even paying attention to hope much money the trump family is making off this presidency...I do respect your opinion but facts are facts

I don't understand why President Trump did not declare this an emergency two years ago when he could have done more and got more money without a fight? Now it will be the Democrats fault and his base will fall in line with that🐑 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑 like mindless sheep

Use the Drug Cartels money to build  the Wall!Amen +++🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😊😊😊🙏🙏😎😎😎

You want reroute wall money to help US citizens? How about we reroute the billions we give illegals instead. How about the billions sent abroad to our so called allies?  Im pretty sure there are tons of dollars wasted on non citizens every day. Why take away our shot at securing the border?

Build the wall. Start a go fund me page. Let’s get that money and build it.

After living near the border and knowing people who worked for border patrol it would be wiser to bring the military home and put them on the border and get rid of the bad border patrol  !  He would win on two fronts bringing military home and saving money because they are home and can be near families and it would be better then the wall.  They should sell all majuana  to place selling it legally to raise money for wall and anyone bringing hard drugs should face a firing squad that will stop drugs and he would be re-elected.

"Tony Lamb .org  I HAD A DREAM!   I have had many end times dreams.   In my dreams I saw the destruction of America. America (Babylon) is Entering Judgement.  I saw nuclear weapons going off in most major American cities. I saw two Asteroids hit the earth. One of these Asteroids caused a Tsunami that was several hundred feet high to hit America's East coast. I saw A mega-earthquake on the west coast that caused two other faults to rip wide open causing another massive Tsunami on the West Coast. Then these earthquakes caused several major Volcanoes to erupt. I saw America ripped in half by the New Madrid fault ripping America in half from the Great Lakes down to New Orleans and this was up to hundreds of miles wide at some points.  America's heartland was turned into a great sea between two continents. And yes I saw Yellowstone erupt with a massive eruption. I was above the earth witnessing all this. But then I zoomed down and in close and I saw civil war in America. I saw Americans shooting and bombing other American's. I saw paper money blowing down the street and no one gave it a thought as it was worthless paper.  Everyone was starving and people were eating bugs

Now just change the immigration laws. No more Sanctuary City status!  No more housing and feeding illegals. All the money spent thus far spent on illegals could have built a Great Wall to protect us. Dems like to frivolously spend our money.   Safety for Americans first!

"are Democrats taking money from the drug cartels politicians all see motivated by money over the best interest for Americans 

So Democrat's say Pelosi has the power of the Purse. Yet...it's not for lack of money that she won't fund the wall. It's because she hates Pres. Trump. And that is what the Supreme Court will say.

Heroin is bad 90 percent of it coming out Mexico To are kids. It's   time to take a stand and these stupid democrats must want there kids to die too SMH.  They must be making money off it. Democrat Crooks need to wake up and support us Americans and quit acting like Mexicans.

If families or mothers are called angel families & angel mothers of those killed by illegal aliens. What are the parents/families/mothers of those killed by American citizens referred to as? If ICE & Border patrol would do their jobs & if American citizens would stop using drugs & if companies would stop hiring illegals (like Trump) we wouldn’t have a problem. Five year olds killed at Sandy Hook & Vegas concert massacre & Parkland. What are these families called? SOL???

Bad photo shop job

Its your number one job as The President of the United States. And youre doing everything in your power to protect us. Not Mexico or any other part of  the world.  Now Democrats apparently work for everyone but Americans and the United States. Lol. They kinda need to. No one trusts them anymore

"This man took an oath too protect us Americans and hes trying too do this.Its not his job to fix all of the  Americans problems of health and finances

"Yes sir! You are only doing your job for which the liberals are persecuting you! Never in my life in my 71 years in my country have I seen such hatred

Trump. Dude. You have been eating up the fake news for years now. Stop it already. Please. Resign. You are not qualified to handle this job. You are screwing up America.

Reading thru these comments i can very well see why this country is in the shape its in .heres a man trying to make this country better and theres people on here acting like spoiled kids that refuse to admit hes doing a good job .its not just about killing or drugs or rape or draining our benefits programs .putting our hospitals in financial problems .drunk driving or even working and sending the money back to mexico and other places its all these and more .money that could help seniors .vets kids .drug addicts .single parents and to try and fix our health ins issues are going for  these illegals .not to mention so called border security. Do you people think they all go to points of entry to come in ?do you know how many miles are open for them to come in .stop and think people .some of you act like you know more about what goes on then people that work and deal with it every day .unless you know for fact dont try to act like it is .all of this dident just start been going on for years .Trump is the first one to care enough to try to stop it .and all the other issues you are bringing up give the man time .hes trying hes not only fighting the stupid democrats hes fighting fools like the ones on here

From Quebec - Canada - You're Right Mr. President Trump - You're doing a great JOB at White House in all areas - Just Fake News and people as them don't agree.  Stay strong with all your near collaborators - You are FANTASTIC  WORKING in the right way tirelessly to get the BEST.  Thanking you to be there - Love - Support- Respect - Pride since Day 1.

Before he hit us he passed a car with a family that had 3 little kids in the car. That could had very well killed them Thank god he didn’t and my husband had to be cut out of the car. He was drunk on top of that. Didn’t spend one night in jail. My husband was I c u for 14 days had too have emergency surgery on his neck and back. This is a man that has never had a broken bone in his body or stitches either. Until that night he still isn’t the same till this day. So yes I’m all for the wall 💯percent. We need a president like Trump he is the one that can get the job done.👍🏻👏👊🇺🇸

We need the wall to help those doing a very good job to protect we the people it would make their job not so difficult.

"So sorry for your tragic loss.  Yes Pres Trump is doing the right thing.  It is unbelievable what the democratic party is doing to this country.  As long as we have Trump we have a chance to save this country.  Thank God for putting him in the White House.  It breaks my heart to think what our country will be like when my grandchildren are grown.  All grandparents need to contact their congressmen and let them know we're tired of their games and they need to do their job

We need the wall!! Great job POTUS for fighting for us!!🇺🇸👍🏽

Trump is god for this time Americans people he doing good job in Washington DC

Great job mr president don’t give up the fight. The swamp is worse then anyone ever thought

So sorry for your loss and everyones loss because of the invasion of illegals.  Every country on the face of the Earth requires foreigners to visit them legally.  It is insane liberal bullshit that has prevented us from securing the border. Trump has done what no president has done before.  He has taken his job seriously.....

Fantastic President trump you are doing a great job for all American families. Keep up with good job.

....and a white person killed how many innocent people in Las Vegas...how many innocent kids got killed by a white kid while at school..how many innocent people got killed while watching a movie at a movie theater by a white person..how many people got killed while attending church services by a white person..just asking for an illegal immigrant who only comes to do a job a white person doesnt want to do..

Joe Jimenez And a black guy killed how many yester at his job? Just trying to point out what a total idiot you truly are in life! You don't have any friends at all huh?I wonder why? Freaking loser!

Bad photo shop job

Its your number one job as The President of the United States. And youre doing everything in your power to protect us. Not Mexico or any other part of  the world.  Now Democrats apparently work for everyone but Americans and the United States. Lol. They kinda need to. No one trusts them anymore

"This man took an oath too protect us Americans and hes trying too do this.Its not his job to fix all of the  Americans problems of health and finances

"Yes sir! You are only doing your job for which the liberals are persecuting you! Never in my life in my 71 years in my country have I seen such hatred

Terry G. Taylor if you are an American you will be chosen for the job after they have filled their illegal obligations.  They past really does repeat itself

"One angel family does not a crisis make!!!!  Trump declares national emergency...  “Nobody’s done the job that we’ve done on the border

An illegal immigrant gave me a blow job once while on vacation in Mexico it was excellent!!!!!!!! She didn’t speak English and I didn’t speak Mexican but she was beautiful and understood American currency. Overall a excellent cleaning lady on my all inclusive vacation

I don’t care how many come over the border I don’t want one here taking up jobs give them your job give them your house give them your wife and your kids I don’t care

Trump. Dude. You have been eating up the fake news for years now. Stop it already. Please. Resign. You are not qualified to handle this job. You are screwing up America.

Reading thru these comments i can very well see why this country is in the shape its in .heres a man trying to make this country better and theres people on here acting like spoiled kids that refuse to admit hes doing a good job .its not just about killing or drugs or rape or draining our benefits programs .putting our hospitals in financial problems .drunk driving or even working and sending the money back to mexico and other places its all these and more .money that could help seniors .vets kids .drug addicts .single parents and to try and fix our health ins issues are going for  these illegals .not to mention so called border security. Do you people think they all go to points of entry to come in ?do you know how many miles are open for them to come in .stop and think people .some of you act like you know more about what goes on then people that work and deal with it every day .unless you know for fact dont try to act like it is .all of this dident just start been going on for years .Trump is the first one to care enough to try to stop it .and all the other issues you are bringing up give the man time .hes trying hes not only fighting the stupid democrats hes fighting fools like the ones on here

From Quebec - Canada - You're Right Mr. President Trump - You're doing a great JOB at White House in all areas - Just Fake News and people as them don't agree.  Stay strong with all your near collaborators - You are FANTASTIC  WORKING in the right way tirelessly to get the BEST.  Thanking you to be there - Love - Support- Respect - Pride since Day 1.

How about coming down on the people who Hire the illegal people.  I think there are more white middle age nuts killing people we just had another nut job shoot up a place of business in Aroura  Illinois this pas t week end.  A wall did not stop that.

now idiots finally get illegal immigrants bravo you finally used your brain good job you won the special medal badge award.

Let’s just start killing illegals🤷🏻‍♂️Maybe nut job Nancy and cry baby Chuck will actually care then. Along with the rest of the anti American Democratic Party. They sure as hell don’t care about Americans.

"Build it all Mr. President. Build it long and build it high. We will go to war to make sure you are able to stay in office and complete your job if it comes to that. We are not afraid. We will continue

"Any Immigrant who wants to enter the US. Should wear a tracking device until proven he or she is ""responsible"" with a Job

When you park your car you lock it! When you leave your home or go to bed you lock up your home! Why because you want to protect your home and valuables! If someone was hurting a loved one of yours would you just sit back or go after them? The President has the same type of job only he's responsible for the entire country! Will a wall stop all of the illegals and the crimes no we all know that but we do need protection! Now if you have an alternative idea great lets hear it! But stop these asinine comments! You go look the victim's families ask them how the feel. You go defend the border!

"There are many people who should have been raided and in jail and or executed. What happened to lock her up.... what happened to 10 years of Donald John Trump knowing how to fire people and get a job done?  The law is really lawyers and judges in the U.S.
