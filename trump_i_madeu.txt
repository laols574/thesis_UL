"The question of whether impeachment is justified should not be confused with the question of whether it is likely to succeed in removing a president from office. The country will benefit greatly regardless of how the Senate ultimately votes. Even if the impeachment of Donald Trump fails to produce a conviction in the Senate, it can safeguard the constitutional order from a president who seeks to undermine it. The protections of the process alone are formidable. They come in five distinct forms..." https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/impeachment-trump/580468/Impeach Donald Trumptheatlantic.com
"There are some things in our nation and in our world to which I‚Äôm proud to be maladjusted‚Ä¶ I never intend to adjust myself to segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few, and leave millions of people perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of prosperity.  I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, and to the self-defeating effects of physical violence‚Ä¶  And I call upon you to be maladjusted to these things until the good society is realized‚Ä¶" --- Martin Luther King Jr.

"Trump has long defined himself as a counter-puncher: When he‚Äôs hit, he feels the need to respond in kind, out of a fear that failing to do so will be a sign of weakness. But in this case his return volley underscored his own impotence. Knowing exactly how to hit him where it hurts, Pelosi has threatened to deprive him of his biggest audience of the year if he persists with his shutdown; in terms of optics and political capital, canceling a Congressional delegation (referred to in official Washington as a CODEL) is small potatoes, and the fact that the legislators were going to see American troops in a war zone that he has not yet bestirred himself to visit only makes him look more petulant." https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-petty-shutdown-games-show-art-deal-author-has-ncna960276?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma

A message of distress from the people of Basra province to the President of the United States of America. Trump respectable.  We are the people of Basra province. We ask you to rescue our province of Basra from the Militias  Gangs who have been stealing the oil of Basrah since 2003 and to this day, they are sending it to Iran and to the terrorist organizations that fund them with weapons. We have been carrying out large demonstrations against these gangs, but they respond to us with repression, torture, murder and assassination. We lack the simplest means of living, such as water and electricity. We demand reforms and appointments for the unemployed youth, many of them graduates and holders of higher diplomas, but the armed groups monopolize appointments for themselves and their parties and gangs. They are killing all those who speak a word and stand against them and they take the presidential palaces in the province of Basra, a place known to the Iraqis, and in the recent demonstrations have fired live bullets at the demonstrators and killed many innocent young people who claim their right, and the assassination of civilian activists In front of their homes and in the streets and markets, We are asking your presence to intervene quickly to rescue us from these dirty armed gangs. We know that the US military has entered Iraq and we welcome this very welcome because we believe that the US military has the ability to rescue Basra, Iraq and Iraqis from these gangs. We hope you will receive this message and respond. Because you are the only hope now for all Iraqis. Thank you Mr. Trump. Youth of Basrah Governorate...........

****Think about This!!**** When Trump was originally going to run for office people told him to bring up immigration reform.  They felt it would be a good campaign platform to run on.   But he kept forgetting it so they told him to use the words ‚ÄúBuild a Wall‚Äù because it‚Äôll help you remember immigration reform.  He liked it so much that he decided to start spewing those words at every rally he had and that became his campaign slogan.  Pretty sure he was never really intending to actually build a wall.  Oh Look a fucking unicorn, meaning a made up thing that turned into him suddenly building a wall!!      Ask your self this question.   If Trump and the Republicans had actually wanted to build a wall, why didn‚Äôt they do it while they were in full control of all three branches of our government??   Obviously they didn‚Äôt need the Democrats help to do it.   They did the supposed tax cuts which was not popular with the Democrats due to it giving tax breaks for the richest people,  if they could do that then why couldn‚Äôt they do that with the wall??   Oh wait that‚Äôs because it didn‚Äôt really matter to Trump, and the Republicans in office didn‚Äôt want the wall!!    The Republicans  in office all sat on their ass and did nothing about the wall!!!  Blame Trump and your party, They had full control of our government and they squandered their chance away to build it if they really wanted it!!    Trump own this shutdown he has caused  and he is doing damage to our people and country all for a lie he created!!

The total street value is estimated at $6,998,000. 2. Puerto Rico 100 lobbyists paid millions to Democratic members of Congress traveled to Puerto Rico, party at fancy seaside resort with rooms costing more than $400 a night live stage shows from New York, during Government shutdown 800,000 great American workers not receiving paychecks.  3.

1 hr ¬∑  "They have aligned themselves with the only viable strategy left: encourage illegal entry.

Meanwhile the Census records the number of people living in each county, which is how representation is scored. This is what many people don't seem to understand. ...

1) They won't be sending quite as much money back home. 2) We won't be educating their children. 3) We won't be spending as much on Illegals health care. 4) Less Welfare and Food Stamps. 5) Fewer Criminal Illegals in our jails.

Now, they are best pals and North Korea still has Nuclear Weapons (just not testing missiles). Iran Deal canceled pissing off EU, Britain, France, Germany, China, & Russia (Iran was complying). USA withdrew from TPP, though, the 11 other nations continued to negotiate and signed the trade deal (Has Trump negotiated any Trade Deals?). A new NAFTA was negotiated which changed percentages and called something else to look like Donald negotiated an incredible deal.  What else? Donald has LIED repeatedly about the Criminal Conspiracy with Russia but still denies any "collusion."  DEFICITS - The Uneducated White Trump Voter (REMEMBER The Tea Party) no longer cares about Deficits. During the Great Recession, Obama ran Trillion Dollar Deficits and these people screamed! The USA will begin running Trillion Dollar YEARLY Deficits this year and The Uneducated White Trump Voter will blame Pelosi and Democrats.  Tax Cuts - The top 1% received a Tax Cut along with Corporations who were making record profits. ** CORPORATE PROPAGANDA - Trump along with Right Wing Media celebrated "bonuses."   The list is endless, but finally and worth repeating again, Donald J Trump is LITERALLY an Unindicted Co-Conspirator. The only reason there is no mugshot of him is that the Office of the Presidency is protecting him...REMINDER - Obama was never an Unindicted Co-Conspirator...  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/29/donald-trump-two-years-halfway-america
1/11/2019 Federal gov‚Äôt is encouraging child marriage Posted January 11, 2019	by Fraidy Reiss  Can you guess the minimum age for someone in the U.S. to petition for a foreign spouse or fianc√©(e)? Or for someone to be brought to the U.S. on a spousal or fianc√©(e) visa?  It‚Äôs zero. The federal government does not specify any minimum age for such petitions.  As a result, we at Unchained have seen girls under 18 forced to marry just so their overseas ‚Äúhusbands‚Äù can get U.S. visas. We also have seen girls brought to the U.S., legally, as child brides. Either way, the girls typically are raped and beaten within their ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù and not allowed to finish their education. All with the federal government‚Äôs approval.  Thanks to the AHA Foundation, which flagged this dangerous loophole and demanded data on the number of children impacted, we now know that between 2007 and 2017, more than 8,600 approved spousal/fianc√©(e) visa petitions involved a child. In 95 percent of those cases, the child was a girl.  We at Unchained lead the growing national movement to end child marriage in the U.S. Along with the National Coalition to End Child Marriage that we co-convened with Equality Now, we will continue to push for a minimum marriage age of 18 in every U.S. state and at the federal level. Please continue to support us as we do so.

28TH AMENDMENT INFORMATION OUR PRESENT SITUATION !  ** Children of Congress members do not have to pay back their college student loans.  ** Staffers of Congress family members are also exempt from having to pay back student loans.  ** Members of Congress can retire at full pay after only one term.  ** Members of Congress have exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed, under which ordinary citizens must live. * For example: they are exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment.  * As the latest example: they have exempted themselves from Healthcare Reform, in all of its aspects.  We must not tolerate an elite class of such people, elected as public servants; then putting themselves above the law; whether they are Democrat, Republican, Independent, etc. The self-serving must stop. ================================================  ** Governors of 35 states have filed suit against the Federal Government; for imposing unlawful burdens upon their states. ** It only takes 38 (of the 50) States to convene a Constitutional Convention.  ================================================= TEXT OF 28th AMENDMENT: 35 States and Counting.  ** Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution: ** "Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States, that does not apply equally to the Senators and/or Representatives. ** Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and/or Representatives that does not apply equally to the Citizens of the United States.."  Congressional Reform Act of 2017 ** 1. No Tenure / No Pension.  * A Congressman/woman collects a salary while in office, and receives no pay when they're out of office.  * No more perks go with them.  2. Congress (past, present, & future) participates in Social Security.  * All funds in the Congressional retirement fund move to the Social Security system immediately.  * All future funds flow into the Social Security system, and Congress participates with the American people. * It may not be used for any other purpose.  3. Congress must purchase their own retirement plan, just as ALL Americans do.  4. Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3%.  5. Congress loses their current health care system, and participates in the same health care system as the American people.  6. Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people (i.e. NO MORE INSIDER TRADING!!!).  7. All contracts with past and present Congressmen/women are void.  * The American people did not make this contract with Congressmen/women. Congress made all these contracts by and for themselves. Serving in Congress is an honor and privilege; NOT a career.  The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators should serve their term(s); then go home and go back to work ‚Ä¶ not get all kinds of freebies.

Or to get a better job or education?  ‚Äîwhy don‚Äôt the higher ups or leaders in those countries do their jobs! and make it a safe and prosperous place for their people to live!! Instead of building a wall...Use the money to make those countries civilized instead of acting like barbaric assholes!  I don‚Äôt get it. Enlighten me please.
@realDonaldTrump To all of the great people who are working so hard for your Country and not getting paid I say, THANK YOU - YOU ARE GREAT PATRIOTS! We must now work together, after decades of abuse, to finally fix the Humanitarian, Criminal & Drug Crisis at our Border. WE WILL WIN BIG!

A 5 times draft dodger fight???
A congressman's salary is peanuts compared to how much they make on the side in payoffs.
A conservative challenged liberal Facebook friends to ‚Äúmake a case, not based on emotion‚Äù against Trump‚Äôs wall. Conservative buddies flooded his post with snide remarks about how this would be impossible for ‚Äúdeluded libs.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll play,‚Äù I responded. And in order to avoid being accused of bias, I explained that I would use only conservative sources to prove my point. My primary source was a policy paper by the Cato Institute, a conservative, rightwing think tank, along with other conservative voices (listed at the end of the piece). Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm against the wall, I wrote:  1. Walls don‚Äôt work. Illegal immigrants have tunneled underneath and/or erected ramps up and down walls to simply drive over them. People find a way. When East Germany erected its wall, it created a military zone, staffed by booted, machine-gun carrying guards ready to shoot to kill. Yet thousands managed to make it to West Germany anyway. More to the point, do we really want to model ourselves after communist East Germany?  2. Most illegal immigrants are ‚Äúoverstayers.‚Äù They come to the US legally ‚Äî for vacations, business, to study, etc. ‚Äî and then STAY past their visas. By 2012, overstayers accounted for 58% (THE MAJORITY!) of all unauthorized immigrants. A wall is meaningless here!  3. Walls have little impact on drugs being brought in to the US. According to the DEA, almost all drugs come in through legal points of entry, hidden in secret containers and/or among legit goods in tractor-trailers. A wall will have little to no impact on the influx of drugs into our country.  4. It‚Äôs environmentally impractical. Walls have a hard time making it through extreme weather. For example, in 2011, a flood in Arizona washed away 40 feet of STEEL fencing. Torrential rains and raging waters do serious damage. Also, conservative sources generally do not address the environmental harm that walls create, but there is plenty of documentation available that show its potential for irreparable damage to both plant and animal life.  5. A wall would forces the U.S. government to take land from private citizens in eminent domain battles. Private citizens own much of the land slated for the wall. The costs of the government snatching private land ‚Äî and the legal battles that would ensue ‚Äî are incalculable.  6. Border patrol agents don‚Äôt like concrete or steel walls because they block surveillance capabilities. In other words, they can‚Äôt mobilize correctly to meet challenges. So in many ways, a wall makes their job more difficult.  7. Border patrol agents say, ‚ÄúWalls are meaningless without agents and technology to back them up.‚Äù Are we prepared to pour countless billions annually ‚Äî after the wall is built ‚Äî to create a nearly 2,000 mile, militarized 24-hour surveillance border operation? Because according to patrol agents, that‚Äôs the only way a wall would work. Again, are we really, going to use East Germany, a brutal communist state, as our model here?  8. Where walls have been built, there was ‚Äúno discernable impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens.‚Äù In other words, they came in elsewhere, primarily where natural barriers such as water or mountainous regions precluded a wall.  9. An unintended consequence is that a wall blocks farmworkers from EXITING when their invaluable seasonal work is done. Farmers are against the wall because it makes getting cheap seasonal labor almost impossible as few American citizens want or can even do those jobs. And if seasonal worker do get in, a wall makes it harder for them to leave! A wall traps migrant farm laborers in our country.  10. Trump‚Äôs $5 billion is a laughable drop in the bucket for what would ACTUALLY be needed. For example, according to the Cato Institute: An estimate for a border wall area that only covered 700 miles was originally 1.2 billion. How much did it REALLY cost? SEVEN BILLION. And that‚Äôs only for 700 miles. Whatever we think it‚Äôs going to cost, experience shows us we have to multiply it by more than 500%.  11. According to MIT engineers, the wall would cost $31.2 billion. Homeland Security estimates it at $22 billion. Given the pattern of spending mentioned in number 10 (plus Murphy‚Äôs Law), that means we‚Äôre really talking about pouring endless billions into something that doesn‚Äôt even work. And, of course, we taxpayers will be footing the bill, not Mexico. Given all the drawbacks, is that REALLY the best use of our taxes?  As the conservatives of the Cato Institute put it, ‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs wall would be a mammoth expenditure that would have little impact on illegal immigration.‚Äù (Emphasis mine) Also it would create many ‚Äúdirect harms:‚Äù ‚Äúthe spending, the taxes, the eminent domain abuse, and the decrease in immigrant‚Äôs freedoms of movement.‚Äù  And, we must add, since conservative sources do not ‚Äî that the environmental harms are likely to be severe.  In other words, the facts show that walls don‚Äôt work and they create even bigger, more expensive problems.  So what happened after I posted this conservative-sourced, fact-based list of why the wall is a bad idea?  Silence.  I waited for someone to respond, to engage with me. Where were the angry defenses or rebuttals? But when I searched for the post after a few days, I couldn‚Äôt find it.  My FB friend had deleted it. You could say, like Trump with the government, he shut me down rather than deal with the facts.  The ugly genius of Trump is his ability to manipulate deep, primal emotions ‚Äî namely fear and hate. He, along with Fox News, have convinced his base that they are in ‚Äúextreme danger‚Äù from immigrants and only a wall will make them ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù  Unfortunately, the need to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù safe is much stronger than the will to grapple with a complex, multi-faceted problem.  And so, here we are, paralyzed by shutdowns at every turn.

A friend once told me that we are all immigrants. Yes but we came through the door at Ellis Island and were documented. We came on by the rules.
A great negotiator would not need to hold over one million Americans hostage, causing them financial anxiety and pain in order to ‚Äúnegotiate.‚Äù  If that is the best approach to ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù you have, you are certainly NOT even a good negotiator, let alone a great negotiator.  You told us your ‚Äústrategy‚Äù in your book The Art of the Deal: ‚ÄúI play to people‚Äôs fantasies.‚Äù  Grow up. Stop hurting our fellow citizens to get your way.  Open the government - NOW....  Then start genuine open give and take negotiations in Congress to ID smart and effective enhancements to our border security, coupled with permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship for the DACA folk......  It is terrible for you to be hurting over one million Americans as part of your ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù strategy.  No wait, it is worse than terrible. It is IMMORAL

A joke to president allows N.Korea to have more warheads than ever before. A gangster to president ignores US people as long he and the family earns money through shady Russian business. The bragging president allows himself to say depressing comments about others and brag about pussy grabbing . A boastful president pays $ 130000 to silence Stormy Daniels. Christian rhetoric in the US is in total chaos . Cheating, pussy grabbing, money laundering president now leading the world's biggest real democracy / country in total chaos and conflicts. Russia, China, N.Korea, Saudi, Syria, EU, wall, what a con
A ladder is even cheaper.
A million vehicles pass the border everyday raise the fee from 44 to 46 dollars the extra 2 dollars at around 700 million per year can pay for and maintain the wall..enough bullshit already that cunt wants to resist at all costs..Pelosi skeleton bitch
A national emergency needs to reviewed every year. It doesn't give you peoples land from imminent domain. Even if a border wall was approved you wouldn't see it.
A petition should be started to remove the senile drunk from her position...lets get someone in there who doesnt HATE America and Americans!
A pledge from you is worth exactly jack üí©
A private U.S. nuclear energy company could begin helping Ukraine in the production of enriched uranium, the fuel in nuclear power plants, according to a statement on Thursday (July 2) from Kiev's nuclear authority, Yadernoye Toplivo
A proposal being rejected even before it was announced! What does that tell us about the Dems? Come forward and make the deal. Our President has a proposal on the table. We Americans need to get back to our normal life. We need to end the shutdown. We need to be a country with secure border.
A republican hailing a monarch...Nobody tell Charles why that amuses me so much. See if he can work it out for himself? :')
A shutdown is the sign of a weak president. No wonder he wants a wall to hide behind.
A teaching fb post ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù from another:  One of my friends told me about a powerful lesson in her daughter's high school class this winter. They're learning about the Salem Witch Trials, and their teacher told them they were going to play a game.  "I'm going to come around and whisper to each of you whether you're a witch or a normal person. Your goal is to build the largest group possible that does NOT have a witch in it. At the end, any group found to include a witch gets a failing grade."  The teens dove into grilling each other. One fairly large group formed, but most of the students broke into small, exclusive groups, turning away anyone they thought gave off even a hint of guilt.  "Okay," the teacher said. "You've got your groups. Time to find out which ones fail. All witches, please raise your hands."  No one raised a hand.   The kids were confused and told him he'd messed up the game.   "Did I? Was anyone in Salem an actual witch? Or did everyone just believe what they'd been told?"  And that is how you teach kids how easy it is to divide a community.   Keep being welcoming, beautiful people. Shunning, scapegoating and dividing destroy far more than they protect. We're all in this together.
A wall / Fence has been an  issue for decades this is the only President that has the guts to see it through
A wall is a tool in MANY necessary steps to fix this issue.  Period. It's a deterrant, not a fix all.
A wall is not necessay or desired.... Station our Military on all American Borders and give the order to lock n load. What part of illegal entry is not understood? Remember 9/11 and never ever forget the lives lost. The lives lost in the War on Terrorism also!
A wall isn‚Äôt going to stop climate change which does far more damage to America than immigrants...yet you do everything you can to defund efforts to fight climate change while wasting money on a wall that can be easily circumvented. üôÑ
A wall will NOT fix our immigration system.
A wall won‚Äôt work AND it will take at least 15 years to build and no less than $25 BILLION.  Prevention by fining those that house and hire illegals (your resorts might be fined though). No birthright for babies of non citizens. Rescind financial aid to these countries that continue to allow this. Why send our money there if they are just going to send their folks here? Why are we being held hostage for a wall instead of the talks happening with leaders of Mexico, Guatemala, or wherever these folks come from? WE should not have to deal with this due to greedy employers, American drug users, and egos from Washington!
A worthy pledge to grieving parents!

Abraham Lincoln was too. Trump is in allot of ways like Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln went against what allot of people thought even though he knew there would be conflicts. Trump is the same half the country hates him but the smart ones know hes doing the right thing.

Absolutely
Absolutely agree this Democratic are horrible
Absolutely- thank you for taking on this issue that so many have kicked down the road.
Actor James Wood" I‚Äôm honored, Mr. President. Those of us who respect your determination to keep campaign promises marvel at your ability to weather the vitriol of #Democrats and their media lackeys. We are devoted to this nation and your love for it. We are here for you.
Actual fake news
Actually he made a couple of promises  Hes having problems with the wall An the deep state an left's are keeping him so busy putting out fires that he has forgot the one promise he made he can do  Make everything declassified on all of the  Deep state and the dems  He may not win the next election but he will go down in history as the man who really cleaned up Washington  An that includes the dems sending  That's wat he should go for Forget the cat an mouse games  They want that  Go big or go home mate  Clean up Washington an you will go down in history forever You dont need to do 2 terms  Try telling the people  That u may not be able to give them all you promised because of the obstructionist but you can get rid of the swamp  Do it  Do it now
Actually there more prayers for trumpski the traitor of the American people to have his feet under the ground
Actually, Trump is probably a BIGGER law breaker than ANY illegal.
Add BISNESS TO MY CHURCH SO WE CAN GOVERN WITH OUT OUT SIDE INFLUENCES  CAUSE I DO NOT WANT REGIONAL AND ADDIE MESS UP CHURCH MISSION
Additionally I have also sent a message to Nancy Pelosi telling her to put an end to this mess and compromise with you for the wall.  But then again no one is actually gonna listen on their end.  I don‚Äôt claim to know all the answers but I do know that we must end the government shutdown now and I know that the Democrats must compromise with you and make a deal.  Instead the Democrats are just dividing America further.
Adil Shahzad Thank you!
Adil Shahzad do you feel the same about the wall the divides the Palestinians from the Israeli's? Would you ask Allah to protect Rivlin? Salam
Adil Shahzad yes and I agree with whatever his decisions are. God has us all day every day prayers
Adria Jackson absolutely blatant!!! Everything they do is because they hate trump. It‚Äôs not for the American people.
Adria Jackson but it is ok for Donny to do it...why?? Cause you wanna screw donny and get some cash.....worthless tramp
Adriana Manciu are you??? STFU!! No face coward!
After all of his supporters beg him not to "fold", he folds.
After what they just turned down Don't give them anything. Nothing
Again though, the grown ups are talking poiitics, you sit quietly and play with your imaginary friend
Again what Nancy and other dems are doing is called Treason and it's an offence punishable by Death.
Agree
Agree 101%
Agree need wall, but don't keep punishing the working class to get it.  If shutdown keeps going, the next thing we'll face is a major Recession.   No money to pay bills, let alone buy anything or even go out to eat.  Use your executive order and end the shutdown
Agree, it will be interesting to see how many Democrats will be missing from the SOTU because they have been indicted.
Ah insults from an inbred :D My day is complete :D

All Americans must be reminded it was the Democrats who would not talk to the Angel families and until November 2020 we can't let them forget it.
All BS !!!!!!
All Hispanic communists trained by Israel must be exposed for trying to divide the USA vs. Mexico.
All I will say is how about all democratic in the senate or congress not getting paid. They really don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like not to get paid or live paycheck to paycheck every week whether you have kids or not. Some of us only make 25000 if we are lucky not 100000-400000 thousand a year. Negotiations need to happen, people need to pay their bills. Do we need more people unemployed. No...
All President has to do is call a national emergency, press the button (its his call) and this will shut down the Government a lot longer than the record of 28 days is now
All Trump supporters should work for free during the shutdown, just like the 800k federal workers Trump didn‚Äôt mention. Put your money where your mouth is!
All Vietnamese people know the Zionists and communists destroyed their country not the USA. Many Vietnamese people love the American people.
All bets off Trump. They do not negotiate...the rules have been made...negotiating is off the table now..they made that decision. This is National Security at issue. Envoke your power...they are clearly representatives of foreigner immigrants and elite foreign donors, but not US Citizens.
All he is doing is starving the family's in need
All of you MAGA people were represented yesterday by a white religious kid in a MAGA hat being a douche to an Native American veteran. Congratulations douchebags!!!!!
All people coming here should  have to have a sponsor to help them . No gov assistance .we can't hold all the people that want to be free and must help fix their country .WE have the greatest country in the world lets not let college educated idiot's destroy it!!!
All theas White Folks that where immigrants and possibly rapist and etc..... there was no boarder Security about 242 years ago when ya came and killed Native Americans and in slaved Black folks hear and ya all came from home land EUROPE but white folks want  a wall now. Can‚Äôt build American like that Remember what ur values was when white folks was escaping mother fuckers like TRUMP IN Europe was white folks u did this about 242 years ago. Can‚Äôt be that   stupid.
All these fucktards are on the way out,we the people are sick of the bullshit.lawsuits will fly politicians will fall.
All they replys but to chicken to reply back
All this as a tribute to childish vanity, Junior Achievement leadership, and Russian strategy:  DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old. Here are 30 ways Americans are feeling the pain:  1. 450,000 public workers are being made to work without pay, including members of the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, Border Patrol, FBI, and Secret Service. 2. 350,000 public workers have been temporarily laid off. 3. Tens of thousands of federal contractors have been laid off for a month, including janitors, security guards, and cafeteria workers. They are losing up to $200 million a day. It is unlikely that they will ever receive pay for the time they have missed. 4. Nearly 10,000 companies that do business with the U.S. government are losing money, according to the Washington Post. 5. Pop-up food banks have opened up to feed unpaid government workers. 6. The four week shutdown is costing the U.S. $200 million a day, or almost $6 billion so far according to analysis by The New York Times. 7. Unpaid TSA workers have been calling in 'sick' or quitting, leading to longer security lines and missed flights. Some airports have begun closing terminals. 8. The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9. Air Traffic Controllers, who were already suffering a 30-year staffing low, have been feeling the strain of going unpaid. Some have begun quitting. 10. With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21. The FTC's identity theft reporting system is shut down. 22. Student loans are being delayed as universities are unable to verify parents' income with the IRS 23. Small Business Administration loans have been delayed. 24. Domestic violence shelters that receive federal funds have been forced to cut services. 25. Highway and transit projects are being delayed or canceled. 26. Wildfire preparations in western states are delayed. 27. The National Hurricane Center's research has been delayed 28. The Smithsonian museums and National Zoo are closed. 29. Funding for Section 8 housing assistance has lapsed, placing low-income families at risk of eviction. 30. Civil cases in federal court have been delayed. Lawsuits against Donald Trump in federal court are on hold.
All true and loyal Americans that love our country want the wall! This is the highest priority for the safety of all Americans. The fight has not been about a wall as we all know, it all about attempting to derail any progress President Trump is making. The speaker of the house is not a person that is capable of perfecting any of us and will always be an obstructionist to secure this country!
All we can do is trust you. Nancy needs to be drugged and put to sleep like the ritual for old useless animals.
All you trumpets dig out your pennies trump gonna need them foooo his wall
All's this for her son WHAT'S have to do with the immigration  isn't because someone cause a accident ,and because he was a police officer ,what about orther peoples dying everyday isn't because of the border ..,O.K. there some criminal ,but ain't everybody ,,,,just common sense  .WHAT'S happening to those dying  of shot gun in USA  . Why isn't always important the life of someone like a officer ,more then someone else

Aloha President, we have found the Simple Solution to the Healthcare Crisis called: Lifestyle Insurance. It‚Äôs everything that you have been looking for that conservatives will love ‚Äì privatizing $5 to $10 trillion worth of lifestyle healthcare now being covered by gov‚Äôt programs. Even Democrats will like. I know, I took it DC.  It‚Äôs best if offered as a 3 to 5-minute presentation in person (via phone) or u can peruse here on Facebook. Link to the 1 page of the 2 page brochure below.   https://www.facebook.com/LifestyleInsuranceSolution/photos/p.996411033845340/996411033845340/?type=1&theater
Alright üíØ‚úîÔ∏è
Alright, let's clear some things up about this shutdown. My job literally requires me to monitor the government funding process, so let me explain what's happening here.   There are 12 spending bills that make up federal government funding. Five of the 12 were passed by the House and Senate last fall, but seven of the 12 were still pending (hence a partial shutdown).   Between October and December, key House and Senate offices met and negotiated details of the remaining 7 spending bills. When those details were worked out, they were ready to go. A two-week extension was agreed to (by both chambers) in early December to work out the final details.   In mid-December, the Senate took the first step and passed all  7 spending bills in a UNANIMOUS decision. That's right, unanimous. 100 - 0. All Republicans and Democrats voted in favor. The package gets sent to the House.  The government could have been funded here, at this very moment, had the House just passed the Senate's unanimously agreed-upon spending package. Shutdown completely avoided. But House Republicans chose not to do that.   Instead, right before the holiday break, the House decided to change the agreement (and add funding for the wall).  They passed an alternative spending package in a highly partisan vote, one that contained funding for the border wall.   So now the Senate and House have two different spending bills (that's not allowed, obviously). Government shuts down. The holiday break happens. January 3rd comes. And then we have a new session. Legislation resets.   Now read carefully because this point is very, very crucial.   Speaker Pelosi could have promoted a "liberal agenda" and advocated for a new spending package that completely gave Democrats everything they wanted. However, she chose to respect the Republican-led Senate's spending package from December. So she left 6 of the 7 spending bills the exact same, word-for-word, as they were in the Senate. Again, the Senate had unanimously voted in favor of these bills just a few  weeks prior.   The sole remaining spending bill was the one with the border wall funding. Speaker Pelosi simply issued a temporary extension on this bill so that the border wall funding could be debated without the government shutting down. Again, she didn't pass a spending bill that said "no funding for the wall". It was a temporary extension to work out the details and ensure negotiations didn't harm workers.   This solution would have, at the very least, kept most of the federal departments unrelated to the border wall open. It would also have kept DHS, TSA, etc., open throughout negotiations, at least until the extension deadline approached.   But Trump and Mitch McConnell are not letting this happen. They are advocating for all of these departments to remain shutdown (even departments that have NOTHING to do with the border).   Since then, Democrats in the House keep passing bill after bill to reopen the government, pay workers while the government is closed, etc. Mitch McConnell is not allowing any of these bills to come to the Senate. All because Trump told him to do that.   These men are monsters. And, by extension, if you support this, you are a monster. These families have become Trump's pawns. And they are suffering because of it.
Also made a pledge that Mexico  was paying for your stupid wall!
Although the Trump administration has called immigration at the southern U.S. border a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù that has a deleterious effect on public safety, unauthorized border crossings are currently the lowest they have been in decades and studies have consistently disproved links between immigration and crime. Further most of the families who crossed during enforcement of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy were charged with misdemeanors.https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/have-undocumented-killed-63000-us-9-11/
Am I allowed to drown bigots in the bath? I doubt it would help then?.
Am black but a real fan of Trump ,I pray for him to wine 2020 vote MAGA
Am with your idea fighter for your share as an American .but as a great country help us also to fight for our share as citizens of our countries .
Amazing just how many people are fooled by all these lies and sit back waiting for more lies ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Amen
Amen  we are standing  with  you.
Amen ! üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
Amen Mr President.  I really wish someone would do a forensic audit on the Democratic Party and Mueller in particular.  It is impossible to get a valid number on even just his expenditures much less the entire RNC.
Amen build the wall.
Amen thank you President Trump
Amen to that!!
Amen!
Amen..
Amen...you‚Äôre the only competent president, not Obama, not Bush, not Clinton can assure and rebuild the core safety life of USA. God bless you & all.
America bring back the kurds to the mountains  The kurds will have to climb up into the mountains, wait for the rule of history again, perhaps it will be merciful. For more information l am kurd
America does not need to be anything like them
America first. Retire pelosi... we voted for a wall, we paid the taxes, we pay your wages, we put ya'll in office to do what we want, need and voted for... who the hell do you think you are?  Build the wall................
America great again!! So, are you giving America back 2 native Indian Americans? I do commend you.
America is not the world's refuge. I am not american but i am for the wall. Others should hold their leaders accountable to build an america for them in their own homelands.
America is so blessed to have you President Trump
America is willing to come together and raise the money out of pocket if someone would get something legitimate started!
America is winning unstoppable üíØüåüüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏èüå∑üí∞
America must have border security which a wall is a major part! We have seen lying politicians for years from both parties promise border security since Regan! We are sick of being lied to. We have your back, stand strong.
America need wall.idiot.you don t know what happening here??
America voted and one of the major items was the wall. How dare they obstruct our needs and wishes!!!
America wants the wall. Go President Trump.
America you got what you voted for.  #yourpresidentyourproblem
American citizens are being forced to work without pay to satisfy a narcissist's egoism and can't get needed medication or pay their mortgage. Paul Ryan was Speaker of the House for two years. Who in their right mind would wait until Nancy Pelosi took over to ask for money for a wall? I guess it would have been more embarrassing to be turned down by a Republican house. Children have died in our custody at the border. The stock market is collapsing due to tariffs and tax cuts destroying people's pensions. Safety protections for workers are attempting to be dismantled. American troops were killed in Syria by ISIS after he wrongly said ISIS was defeated. He is friends with murderous dictators in numerous countries and disrespectful to the leaders of democracies. The list is almost endless. If you still support Trump you aren't paying attention.
American's be reminded Hairy Diarrhea Mouth Baboon Trump caused the shutdown, same Bill last month,he signs yesterday,what stuns me your information,that Democrats did not talk to Angel Families,also all the information about Democratics,media,your negatives to everyone that disagrees with you and Hairy Diarrhea Mouth Baboon Trump,campaign promise Mexico will pay for the wall.
Americanism not globalism will be our credo!!! #AmericaFirst  #DrainTheGlobalistControlledSwamp  #BuildTheWallImmediately  #TrumpPence2020
Americans first. Thank you Mr. President!
Americans need JFK not FDR. FDR a commie
Americans need to secure its borders like Israel and Russia.
Americans never heard a word about this (cough) fight until Democrats took the house. Trump and the GOP Own this shutdown.
Americans now issue new compromise proposal.  Screw the Democrats.  No Amnesty.  Have the Military START BUILDING THE WALL, but do not announce it.  We don't give a damn about what the Democrat criminals say.  Build a WALL, not steel slats.  Keep the government shut!  Do not let the pressure off of the Democrat criminals. Start deporting the 11 million ILLEGAL ALIENS brought in through no fault of the American people.  And by the way, its more like 35 million, not 11 million.  This is our final offer.  The next step is to put Chuck and Nancy in prison in Guantanimo.
Americans want a wall just like the one in San Antonio that Trump says works so well.
Amie so true
Amy Hays I Agree with you.  I was being sarcastic when I said let‚Äôs give them money instead of a wall. I‚Äôm tired of everyone blaming Trump. It‚Äôs their government they should fix their side of the road. These countries should be up to par with the U.S. by now.  Right?
Amy Johnson President Trump has been working for free since he got elected and is the only one in the government who has been working during the shut down!
Amy Johnson Unlike your pathetic ass we care when our police are fucking shot dead by illegals ass wipe 300 Americans die EVER day from fentanyl that come across our border? We're you born stupid???
Amy M Coltrane https://youtu.be/hxz7b58-mxc
Amy Patrick about 2 weeks ago Howdy. To recap: I‚Äôm a licensed structural and civil engineer with a MS in structural engineering from the top program in the nation and over a decade of experience on high-performance projects, and particularly of cleaning up design disasters where the factors weren‚Äôt properly accounted for, and I‚Äôm an adjunct professor of structural analysis and design at UH-Downtown. I have previously been deposed as an expert witness in matters regarding proper construction of walls and the various factors associated therein, and my testimony has passed Daubert. Am I a wall expert? I am. I am literally a court-accepted expert on walls. Structurally and civil engineering-wise, the border wall is not a feasible project. Trump did not hire engineers to design the thing. He solicited bids from contractors, not engineers. This means it‚Äôs not been designed by professionals. It‚Äôs a disaster of numerous types waiting to happen. What disasters? Off the top of my head... 1) It will mess with our ability to drain land in flash flooding. Anything impeding the ability of water to get where it needs to go (doesn‚Äôt matter if there are holes in the wall or whatever) is going to dramatically increase the risk of flooding. 2) Messes with all kind of stuff ecologically. For all other projects, we have to do an Environmental Site Assessment, which is arduous. They‚Äôre either planning to circumvent all this, or they haven‚Äôt accounted for it yet, because that‚Äôs part of the design process, and this thing hasn‚Äôt been designed. 3) The prototypes they came up with are nearly impossible to build or don‚Äôt actually do the job. This article explains more: https://www.google.com/‚Ä¶/mobile.engineering.‚Ä¶/amp/17599.html And so on. The estimates provided for the cost are arrived at unreasonably. You can look for yourself at the two-year-old estimate that you see everyone citing. http://fronterasdesk.org/‚Ä¶/Bernstein-%20The%20Trump%20Wall.‚Ä¶ It does not account for rework, complexities beyond the prototype design, factors to prevent flood and environmental hazard creation, engineering redesign... It‚Äôs going to be higher than $50bn. The contractors will hit the government with near CONSTANT change orders. ‚ÄúCost overrun‚Äù will be the name of the game. It will not be completed in Trump‚Äôs lifetime. I‚Äôm a structural forensicist, which means I‚Äôm called in when things go wrong. This is a project that WILL go wrong. When projects go wrong, the original estimates are just *obliterated*. And when that happens, good luck getting it fixed, because there aren‚Äôt that many forensicists out there to right the ship, particularly not that are willing to work on a border wall project‚Äî a large quotient of us are immigrants, and besides, we can‚Äôt afford to bid on jobs that are this political. We‚Äôre small firms, and we‚Äôre already busy, and we don‚Äôt gamble our reputations on political footballs. So you‚Äôd end up with a revolving door of contractors making a giant, uncoordinated muddle of things, and it‚Äôd generally be a mess. Good money after bad. The GAO agrees with me. And it won‚Äôt be effective. I could, right now, purchase a 32 foot extension ladder and weld a cheap custom saddle for the top of the proposed wall so that I can get over it. I don‚Äôt know who they talked to about the wall design and its efficacy, but it sure as heck wasn‚Äôt anybody with any engineering imagination. Another thing: we are not far from the day where inexpensive drones will be able to pick up and carry someone. This will happen in the next ten years, and it‚Äôs folly to think that the coyotes who ferry people over the border won‚Äôt purchase or create them. They‚Äôre low enough, quiet enough, and small enough to quickly zip people over any wall we could build undetected with our current monitoring setup. Let‚Äôs have border security, by all means, but let‚Äôs be smart about it. This is not smart. It‚Äôs not effective. It‚Äôs NOT cheap. The returns will be diminishing as technology advances, too. This is a ridiculous idea that will never be successfully executed and, as such, would be a monumental waste of money. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This is set to public. Have a blast sharing it.
Amy, I‚Äôve been there. And I would like to come back. How are you helping? And, by the way, this wasn‚Äôt about El Paso, itwas about Trump once again making incredibly ignorant statements.
An immigration already appeared to bear so many more problems in the world except that America and Europe countries where happens in too much trouble and social security!
And Dr. MLK Jr. was against abortion.
And I back you 100%
And I'm sure you say the same about Obama? Not to mention chuck and Nancy voted for more wall under Obama then they are being asked for now and you think the wall is what they are holding firm on? They are just saving face and playing for their team which apparently daca is not part of. Way to stab yourselves in the back idiots.
And Nancy can go to hell!  She has a wall, Clinton's have a wall, Blasio & Bloomberg have a wall....Zuckerberg and Bill Gates have walls.  The Hollywood jerks have walls...why not our border?
And Trump doesn't read, he just looks at the pictures
And Trump has unified the states? He's the most hated man ever in the Office :')
And an hour since my last comment? That's can't shut up to you is it? Looks like I'm not the only one "craving attention"?
And by the way. Google the last name.
And cook your own food if you don't like the service :D its simple. Not like McDonalds isn't making Billions worldwide? They could easily pay a decent living wage. They just want more bonuses for the parasites at the top.
And democrat votes......
And double Irony, descendant of European Colonist tells somebody to go back to where they belong :')
And fix ITIN, illegals claim 9 -10 children on their taxes and those kids don't even live here, illegals getting back 10k and More for refunds, stupid loophole!!!
And how is he getting a second term, are they running him against Hillary again? :')
And meeting with lobbist lining there pockets while other people are out of work shows how much they care
And most of America is with you.
And put him in front of a firing squad for Treason!
And since you do you are immoral also?
And so stupid you have no idea what Republican means :D
And some chick climbed over that wall too.
And stop sending our tax dollars to other countries.  We need it here now.  The cost of housing has caused people to have to live on the streets.
And tell us why Congress is still getting a pay check üò®üò® stop it right now for god sake if we don't work we don't get paid ..  stop the pay. Build the wall stand strong don't back down üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
And that is a surprise how? Pelosi is a Democrat. Quite simply, they don't care!
And that's why we voted for you!! Finally a president that actually cares about the USA and acts on it!
And then hiding because he's a coward :D
And they come in holding their flag....how crazy is that.....stay and fight for your country.......democrats are to blame because of they are promissing all free living.......all paid by us.......our president is 100% right......not fair to american to have to support all illegals.....some gangs....killers.....money is so needed here !
And they were welcomed with open arms before Raping and Murdering everything in sight. I know history well. Good solid Christians they were. hahaha
And to quote Donald trump himself ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter what we build the wall out of or how good it is if they wanna get in they‚Äôre gonna get in‚Äù
And what about the mothers who children were shot at school? Or the mothers of the 4 soldiers killed in Syria last week ? What about the mother of the children you‚Äôve lost in your internment camps ?
And what is actually broken?
And who‚Äôs going to pay for that wall? https://www.facebook.com/1197578755/posts/10216161466128198/
And yet Moron Don is the one having the temper tantrum Anya?

And you idiots call yourselves patriotic Americans who want to rid America of its actual institutions of democracy.
Andrea Berkstresser this doomsday propaganda is killing me
Andrew Behrens Typically the only answer you have, throwing in the head of people you are an empty brain, like your president
Andy Jenkinson, then couldn‚Äôt those same electronics be used in concert with a wall to stop those from entering illegally? Remember there is more than one problem, which then require more than one solution
Andy Jenkinson, then if drug barons will use micro lights to fly over the border, then your solution to add more agents wouldn‚Äôt solve the problem either, would it?
Angel Families,. Prayers & R.I P. Children.
Angel Families?  Nationalists. You might want to do something about your white catholic boys wearing MAGA hats.,. You all know that the KKK used the same slogan MAGA.. Pathetic
Angel Families?  What do you mean by Angel Families?
Angel Moms? Using gods name to justify hate Again!
Angel families?  What about "gold star" families?
Angel families? Work on all the Americans killing Americans. It's a much bigger problem.
Angela Lynne but I want to say ty for you and your husband's sacrifice during this very preventable time...üíô
Angela Lynne pawns ?? So tell me , your husband works at a prison ?? They have walls right ? Big ones ? Razor fence ? Armed security ?? Hmmmmmm sage thing our border needs .. once it happens for us all , then the shutdown will be over
Angela Lynne please call your elected officials in Congress n tell them to give up their paycheck while your husband works without his...
Angela Lynne put pressure on the Democrats and it will happen
Angela Maria how will the wall fail to stop illegals. Yes, a few will get through, but right now, you can just walk up to an imaginary line and toss your unwanted child into another country.  OUR children and young women are also taken across that line and sold into slavery. So, tell us, oh wise one, why the wall won't stop people?  Do the walls in your house not reduce your access to entries and exits?
Angela Merkel makes Europe great again. EUROPE First
Angela Wilson agree so very well said
Angela Wilson and democrats in America are socialists.  You can tell by thise that are on this page. They are all they riot they aren‚Äôt
Angela Wilson go check the facts Angela. Reaching out to help those refugees does not make country that does that a socialist country. That is the Christian thing to do. For trump to use those refugees to frighten Americans is absolutely scandalous. Shame on trump for doing it, shame on his followers who are buying it.
Angela Wilson is that all, you just made America feel like heaven, the way you criticized those European countries, your police force kills their own children, I mean if they see blacks as theirs, i don't hear stories like that in others countries
Angela Wilson very well said.   I agree
Angela Wilson you collect social security, you old socialist.
Angela Wilson you do not know European socialism, the Americans. It's not diabolical, it's just thinking about people in need, it's solidarity above all else. You have a false idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsocialism. In France and Europe we are losing more and more and we have to fight in the street against excessive capitalism. Excusez mon anglais üòÅ
Angela Wilson you use you tube as a valid reference point?  Were your parents siblings or did your mother take a whole lot of drugs?
Angle families are victims of ILLEGAL immigrants
Angus Reid Beaton no haven't seen any Mexicans on the boat's

Ann Coulter‚ÄèÔÄ≤Verified accountÔÇô @AnnCoulter ¬∑ 16h16 hours ago   100 miles of border wall in exchange for amnestying millions of illegals. So if we grant citizenship to a BILLION foreigners, maybe we can finally get a full border wall.

Anne Coughlan them you need a trip to the TX border. I live in TX and ILLEGALS are being bussed into our towns.  Walls do work! On parts of the border where there are barriers, illegal entry is almost non existent. Yes, people can tunnel and OCCASIONALLY do, but Nancy‚Äôs electronic dogs are not the answer.
Anne Coughlan very true, these people are believing all the lies Trump is telling...smh...i just can't believe how they just blindly believe him. So frustrating!  There are more important things to spend that money on, especially with the rich getting those ridiculous tax cuts!! Has to be made up somehow!

Anne Crossway I truly think he is enjoying this. He loves drama. That's what you get when you elect a reality show guy for president. Country's biggest mistake ever.
Anne Crossway I'm going to trust the EXPERT Border Patrol agents that say they NEED a wall to funnel people to the ports of entry and will aide in the use of other technology, rather than your opinion. SMH
Anne Crossway Trump has six more years to trigger liberals just hang in there sister.
Anne Crossway a bill that offers billions to other countries abortion and no wall here, you mean that offer?
Anne Crossway agreed no only will it not work it will cause irreparable damage to the ecosystem, on top of blocking many people from vital water they need in an area with so little already
Anne Crossway keep it shut down and eventually the democrats will give in when the food stamps run out for their illegal immigrants
Anne Crossway vote your conscience, I sure will!
Anne Crossway voters are turning against him because they are ignorant and do whatever thier phone and tv tell them. If there is reincarnation id hope to come back as ignorant as you. Always seem like the ignorant have easier lives

Anyone know about how much it costs to support illegals we have right now for a year?
Anyone out there can help us please and thank you. https://www.gofundme.com/6qhodig
Anyone who doesn't want our borders secure is an enemy of our country
Anyone who has a fenced yard or lives in a building with security who opposes the wall is a hypocrite. Simple  as that!
Anything that's true and that you fools don't believe, you claim to be false. You're like two year olds... "Not true! Nanny nanny boo boo! I know I am but what are you." Thank God you only represent 20% of the population at this point and it's dropping by the day. In spite of the fake president and his fake claims.
Anything trump is trash!!.
Apowerfulmen,change the world forever
Apparently you don't understand how the Constitution works.  Government employees don't get paid unless there is a budget to pay them.  The person holding up the budget is Nancy Pelosi.
Apparently you made a stronger pledge to Putin to destroy our country.  #AgentOrange #RussianAsset
Araceli Rodriguez Move south
Araceli Rodriguez and noone more ignorant to reality than a liberal ass....stfu with your nonsense
Araceli Rodriguez and you please go to your Mexico. Trump is a global leader. Love, support, and respect him.
Araceli Rodriguez well YOU are INFORMED about the Angel Mom's right? You support even ONE more be added to the list! Shameful!
Araceli Rodriguez what a ridiculous uninformed comment
Araceli Rodriguez you‚Äôre the brainwashed one, believing the Demonrat lies! You really think they care about Daca?? They won‚Äôt even compromise, they could careless about anyone but themselves. üò°
Are you a US citizen? From Italy....hmmmm...what concern is it of yours? You are free to pay for OUR wall.
Are you good at marketing? And you desire to work from home.Inbox me.  Cost $0.00 to start. T&C apply
Are you kidding me? And exactly what RACE are you again? If your not a Native American, you are from a family of immigrants. Do you not understand this? Good grief
Are you talking about Democrats here or our beloved President? It's hard to tell in the first few lines? Can you please clarify?
Are you tone death to the truth or just plain stupid ..
Arlen Balagot WHAT?
Arnold Ringer and you are off in the head.and stupid
Arnold Ringer idiot
Arthur Fejfar Trump called the Asylum seekers drug dealers murderers and rapists... they said they took your spot on the line? So what do you do for a living? ü§î
Arthur Fejfar same stupid argument , how ,many people do you know that have immigrants living with them and eating their food ? NONE so stop it with the bullshit argument that a wall is needed just because we lock our doors at night , i lock mine to keep white drug addicts out
Article IV, Section 4 of our Constitution REQUIRES our government to protect and defend our borders. If government does not, the Constitution, by virtue of the named part herein, AUTHORIZES the Free Citizens(s) to defend themselves and their state in place of TREASONOUS GOVERNMENT. **note; In NOT defending our borders, government gives "aid and comfort" to a hostile foreign invasion; and THIS, under Article III, Section 3 of our Constitution is properly labeled TREASON!‚Äù
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana   They most certainly won't hurt. Gives boarder patrol a bit of an advantage.  Please listen to those that face it everyday.  They know best.
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana : Leave me ask you a question.  Do you lock your doors at night?
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana : The Border Agents say the walls work.  Considering that they put their lives on the line everyday, I will believe them over the liberal hypothetical opinions.
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana And you think shooting women and children (and men too) is a better way to stop the illegal crossings would be better than a wall? Maybe you should rethink that.
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana I want border security and if a wall helps with that, I would rather use that method other than shooting immigrants!! No one single thing is going to work but a wall is a deterrent. We use walls around prisons to help keep the bad guys in, they seem to be doing the job! An escape now and then? Maybe, but nothing is fail proof just added defense! What‚Äôs wrong in a steel fence with razor wire to help the men and women of the border patrol in protecting our country? I think it‚Äôs not the Wall, you have a problem with, it‚Äôs who will get kudos for actually making it a reality!! TRUMP!
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana Really üôÑ You obviously didn‚Äôt read my comments or can‚Äôt comprehend!
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana Well, I remember when Clinton in fact both thought the wall and a stricter border control to keep out unwanted illegals.  I saw Obama say the same thing regarding our need for a wall and we had to curtail the influx of illegals. Now, we have someone willing and ready to get the job done but? What happened? The wall is still needed for the same reasons as Democrats wanted then, what‚Äôs changed with it being effective? Nothing!!! Except Trump is pushing for it and unless Pelosi gets her head out of her ass, it‚Äôs going to be a really tough time for a lot of federal workers! But hey, she can take another vacation she has no worries, right!! Nothing like working for your citizens that support you ü§î
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana good point but it would be alot harder if they had to scale over a steel slated barrier..
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana lmao stop drugs and illegals is a supply and demand issue?? This is now just ridiculous! You obviously have a invested interest in not wanting this wall to help our border agents!!üò≥
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana mhttp://dlvr.it/Qx3hxn
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana oops! Didn‚Äôt get my point again!üôÑ What I‚Äôm saying is, if a wall and guards around your home and family is good enough for you, what about our country and citizens!
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana the wall will work
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana why do you think Pelosi, Waters, the Clinton‚Äôs the celebrities all have walls around their homes Oh and guards?? That‚Äôs not deco !!üò≥
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana you need some common Sense if we stop drugs and illegals from coming into America crime will go down. Fact is real border security and wall where needed would pay for itself in 2?years! If you are capable these facts are easy to find.
Arturo Elroy Ma√±ana you're a "MORON"!!
Arturo I appreciate and respect your opinion but please think about border patrol agents at that border with no protection against hundreds of people rushing to cross! It is impossible and dangerous to not have any barrier or protection for them. You NEED some sort of deterrent and protection for those on the job
As President, you made a promise TO ALL Americans, not just your far-right base.
As President, your main job is to run the government- not shut it down! Please President Trump, open all the government, then work on border security! This government shutdown will go down in history as Republican Trump‚Äôs government shutdown, the longest government shutdown in history, and is hurting the Republican Party.
As Trump drags us into week 5 of the #TrumpShutdown, it's important to remember that he is holding 800,000 patriotic American workers hostage because he wants us to pay $5.7 billion dollars for a wall he promised repeatedly that Mexico would pay for!  Tell the Senate to pass the House spending bills and re-open the government here: http://bit.ly/2TtVTwr #NoWall
As a mother who lost her child at the hands of failed immigration policies, I know just how important border security is to American families.  I watched my son, Javier Vega, Jr., gunned down by two illegal aliens who viciously ambushed our family while we were on a fishing trip in Texas.  Javier served his country as both a Border Patrol Agent and a U.S. Marine, but he spent his last moments bravely defending my family from these ruthless animals.  Any mother who has lost a child in this way can attest that there is nothing more gut-wrenching than knowing that their sacrifice was entirely avoidable.  Politicians had neglected their responsibility to keep my son safe by ignoring our country‚Äôs desperate need for immigration reform for decades.  Three years ago, Donald Trump gave new hope to every American family like mine that has lost a loved one at the hands of illegal aliens who never should have been allowed into the country in the first place. ‚ÄúI hear you, I see you, and I will never let you down,‚Äù he promised us.  Since then, President Trump has never wavered from his promise to protect our families by building a wall on the southern border.  When the media ignored us, he listened. When the politicians mocked us, he comforted us.  Because he understood how failed immigration policies destroyed our families, he brought our stories to the forefront of the public consciousness and fought tirelessly to make our plight known.  President Trump gave a voice to Javier and the countless others whose lives were taken by illegal immigrants, and I am forever grateful to him for that.  But Javier‚Äôs story is just one of many that never made the headlines and likely would have gone unheard and unaddressed if not for the President‚Äôs unrelenting commitment to fix our broken system.  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to see this fight through to the end. We cannot let another child become collateral damage of the reckless open-border agenda.  Of all the promises President Trump has made and followed through on, fixing our broken immigration system is the most important.  In my home state of Texas alone, over a quarter million criminal aliens have been arrested and charged with over 600,000 crimes in just the past seven years.  My family paid the ultimate price for the failed immigration policies that allowed these crimes to happen, and I owe it to my son to demand accountability from the elected officials whose indifference cost him his life.  I am not alone. The majority of Americans overwhelmingly oppose illegal immigration and want a safer country. That‚Äôs why we elected Donald Trump to be our President.  He‚Äôs always had our backs, and now we want him to know that we have his.  President Trump, now more than ever, we support you in your battle to resolve our border crisis before more American families experience the tragedy mine has had to endure.  Marie Vega is a proud mother of two sons who served in the US Marine Corps. One was Border Patrol Agent Javier ‚ÄúHarvey‚Äù Vega Jr. and the other is mineral well engineer, Jordy Vega. She works as a bookkeeper at a local law firm.
As always somebody with a strange last name has something dumb to say against trump ..
As always,  nice job Laura. Your show is one of my favorites!
As it is not sea to shiny sea people will go around it, drug barons will use microlights to fly over it. $500 per inch is still ridiculous. Better to use the money at the crossing points for detection and personnel. Is he planning on replacing the existing barriers which are lower than 30ft and have no detection equipment? Where can we see the exact specification for the wall?
As soon as the Dems took the house, he called it an Emergency  ..lol  The house and the senate agreed on a budget  deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!   The Trump administration tried to dismantle DACA, that shields approximately 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation, in the fall of 2017, but a prolonged court battle has kept the initiative alive. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also announced the eventual termination of TPS protections for more than 250,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Honduras, Sudan and Haiti, but a federal judge blocked the decision in early October.  Now he says he‚Äôll give a temporary stay for them, something he took away.. for his 5.7 none border he PROMISED and GARENTEEED ! Mexico would pay for... lol ‚Ä¶ yes more barriers where immigration says it needs, not 5.7 billion for his dumb wall, MAJOIRTY of drugs come in cars at ports of entry, FACT!
As soon as trump could see he couldn't  give Putin what he was asking for, like being allowed in the g8 again. And he  saw he was not allowed to obstruct justice and undermine the institutions. He then began to get revenge on those leaders institutions and allies and citizens who have opposed his agenda.  Putins plan right out of the white house, to create a new cold war against Mexico and Canada and the allies. By using immigration and trade wars and nationalism. To divide the nations and the people from each other and from their leaders. While he is creating a new three amigos alliance, of Putin Trump Kim along with other autocratic regimes. Where trump continues to meet with, and ignore, and enable their rigged agendas.
As the Trump administration demands funding for a border wall, a new study finds that for the seventh year in a row, visa overstays far exceeded unauthorized border crossings.
As thousands of AMERICANS struggle due to the shutdown. Way to go, Mr. President! You‚Äôve sure left your mark now.  I sympathize in the Angel families and believe we need to secure our borders. But what about those that are about to be evicted because they already live paycheck to paycheck?   Despicable!
As today and yesterday and this entire shutdown episode have revealed the president is not just corrupt or disloyal or hateful or incompetent or unfit to hold the office.  He is also stupid.  That's not something we say in polite political debate.  But it's a fact.--
Ashley Archer it works at other schools. They have to go through security checkpoints. Israel has never had a school shooting and they implement the same security measures that we want here.
Ask California we have about 5 million that we take care of. We are in debt to and the stupid governor wants more.
Ask a Psychic to contact John McCain and ask why he voted against it.
Ask why Melanoma was flying around during the shutdown, too. Oh, you don't actually care.
At present, ConverDyn is interested in cooperation with Ukrainian companies in the field of uranium conversion services for Ukraine‚Äôs nuclear energy industry," the official statement reads.

At the cost of making the average American people suffer right, your wall is NOT more important than American lives. You're basically engaging in war with the middle and lower class and pray they bring it to your doorstep.. remember there's only a couple hundred of you but millions of us!!
At the expensive of the American people. üôÑ

BZ Mr President!
Back in December, it looked like President Donald Trump and the Democrats had a deal to fund the government. Then Ann Coulter weighed in, branding the president "gutless" and ‚Äúa vulgar publicity hound‚Äù for failing to deliver on his biggest campaign promise of 2016: to build a ‚Äúbig, beautiful‚Äù wall on the southern border, even with his party in control of both houses of Congress.  A day later, Trump informed then-House Speaker Paul Ryan he would not sign a Senate spending bill to keep the government open, triggering what's become the longest government shutdown in modern American history.     Trump is not running the USA Ann Coulter is.
Ban guns.
Barb van der Burg  because she has a home there. I guess Nancy has homes in terrorist countries ?
Barb van der Burg .............blow me
Barb van der Burg SHE IS NOT part of the negotiations. DO YOU EVER THINK? NO?
Barb van der Burg So literally the only place I found this article was on a site called "crooks & liars" I really try to do research to see if you Dims are correct but once again it's just Trump Derangement. Did CNN have anything to do with this? We all know they've gone over the cliff when it comes to Trump.
Barbara Blitfield Pech sorry but I am not a politician, and I am not a moron, BTW what is a politician moron?   So exactly what was wrong with the post I made, I know that I did not believe very much of what Bill Clinton, or Barack Obama promised, they lived up to my expectations!  So far most of what Trump can deliver on his promises, he has delivered, he has not yet delivered on promises that are dependent on congress and treasonous democrats, Trump has integrity, or he never would have succeeded as a business man.   We have a long history of liberal democrats lying to the people, and not giving a damn if they keep their promises.   Up until now the problem with republicans is they do not have the balls to fight the traitors known as democrats, that is until Trump!   Oh if possible name 10 democrat politicians with integrity, who are actively working for the American people, and not just shouting Heil Hussein when their leaders tell them to!
Barbara Schoelerman they can leave our land alone we dont care for cheerios or james Fonda 30 mi,ute workout videos and your democracy sucks
Barr is Deep State OP. Do Not Confirm.
Be an American President for American's, don't back down.
Be careful with how you treat People
Be cheaper for Nancy to disappear. Ask Clintons
Because I like both sides of an arguement before making my mind up? If you think that makes an idiot then no wonder you like Moron Don :D
Because it doesn't.
Because most Americans know it has nothing to do with security but is only an ego stroke for the orange groper.
Because of Trump's policies Black unemployment falls to "LOWEST LEVEL ON RECORD"-Thank you President Trump...Obama did "NOTHING" for the black community. Democrats remember #JobsNotMobs
Because of the actual ways they are getting in. Not everyone travels 80 miles through desert and very rough terrain heading to where you don't know.
Because...this is one of the best suggestions I have seen for this administration.  Found in the comment of a post today: Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Becky Penney er ok......üí©
Before you build the wall, can you finish the I-5 Interstate here in Los Angeles first? A measly 10 mile expansion is being worked on for about 10 years.
Behind you 100% Pres. Trump
Behind you all the way, please don't give up the fight!
Behind you, all the way, Mr. President.
Believe the numbers mr.president ,the people r with you ,go for the wall and everything will be fine.action meen more numbers.2020maga

Betsi Bell Lynch Donny is sealing his fate as a one-term president!  Bwahahahahaha!!  Talk about obvious statements...EVERYONE agrees we need border security.

Betsy girl here's the question how can you be strong when you have bone spurs
Bette Ford  At least a couple of times?  Who do you think you are kidding?  I‚Äôve been laid off three times and I remember each.  At least a couple of times?  Well was it 2 or three......Bot, you‚Äôre Full of Shuuuuuuugar!
Bette Ford  No back pay, no free food...one of three times received 3 months severance pay...that was it. To be fair, fortunately my wife worked and I did child care to save $$$....and that was OK too. Mitch McConnell has the power to stop this but won‚Äôt allow a vote because if he did, Lyin Donnie would look like a fool
Bette Ford  Please cite his compassion actions....like keeping all those children in internment camps?  Bette, time to go back to your namesake clinic and get a grip?
Bette Ford  Were you furloughed as a government employee....Please cite facts, not conjecture?
Bette Ford  When will they be paid...Lyin Donnie said it might take months....how about if you were furloughed.....knowing eventually you will get paid.....Time to get real Bette and stop with the platitudes
Bette Ford I‚Äôve never taken babies away from their mothers, locked them up and lost them through out America! Give me a break! No life lost is right! Get Over your holier than thou attitude!
Bette Ford Why is anyone giving this whacko a voice anyway? She doesn‚Äôt even live in this country.
Bette Ford may God strike you down for being a Heathon!
Bette Ford you need a good lay, get the stink out of you! Let me tell you, you‚Äôre one deranged fool!
Bette Ford, may I suggest using a few fingers, you know where?

Bill Ajello Really? All the Dems wanted the wall before Trump came into the picture. This is not his shutdown!
Bill Ajello, you certainly do not reflect any Christian values yourself.
Bill Briggs so violate the constitution and declare a police state? You‚Äôre a moron.
Bill Briggs,  I agree with you,Nancy doesn't want to give in with the president, then emergency order, close the borders off,  Nancy is the speaker , not the president
Bill Harris I'm pretty sure both parties have been screwed up in many different ways over time. The Republicans are the mess right now. The Trumpers/Tea party have driven away Republicans in droves. So much that people I never thought would vote democrat are switching parties. Trump is the biggest mistake they ever made.
Bill Klein So can the idiots who are blocking what we want...you might take notice that this country voted Donald Trump into office..whether, or not, you want to believe it...it's true. We voted him into office because of the platform he ran on.  I can't imagine what kind of trouble this country would be in if the big cities made all of our decisions.  Thank God for the electoral college.
Bill couldn‚Äôt agree more I told myself I would never have more kids then what I could take care of so I only had 1.
Bingo, Brent  !!

Bob Evans, we aren‚Äôt suckers. We just know we can‚Äôt endure an annual expense of 54-125 billion and not expect it to be pushed into the national debt. At some point the interest alone will sink the country
Bob Evans, what‚Äôs stupid is Americans haven‚Äôt yet figured out if we don‚Äôt curb our expenses, we won‚Äôt have a country very much sooner. Most likely, by 1/2020, our debt will be at 25 trillion and the annual interest alone will be close to 1/3 of a trillion

Bob Segal
Bob Segal  and Cora: Bob is showing us that the poll I referred to was 1POINT OFF - and the one below it, which I should have quoted, would have been accurate.  A ‚Äòstone cold lie‚Äô or the wrong line which put me one point off, using Bob‚Äôs proof?  Please.   Cora, snowflake, don‚Äôt defend the popular vote when speaking about the Electoral College President. Actually, the poll that said she would win the popular vote was correct, wasn‚Äôt it, by 3MILLION?!   Why do you guys get so uppity on issues where you are only marginally correct or incorrect?  You must loves you some pussy grabbin demigod, eh?
Bob Segal  take away the vote for retired people also, if you can't vote till 18, you shouldn't be allowed to vote once you reach 75. Also no president after retirement age.
Bob Segal -  I don't :)
Bob Segal - 40% does not make for a high approval rating.. No matter how you spin it..
Bob Segal Ah, I see. Re-read my post. I never mention an average. I see your mistake. I wrote ‚Äòa poll‚Äô not ‚Äòan average.‚Äô  I believe that POLL was at 42% in December.
Bob Segal It alway makes me laugh when you folks have nothing to say of value. you invoke body parts or body functions. LOL
Bob Segal LOL nice try.  Trump is a liar and untrustworthy
Bob Segal Term limits for congress is needed badly. Too much power is obtained as time accumulates and all those bastards re self serving. Also, I'm not even slightly convinced building that wall is going to change much of anything. Its another band aid that fails to address the source of the problems that cause people to want to leave central America and come here. There are other ways to approach this but nobody ever mentions them.
Bob Segal WTF? I wanted to share that Pew was at 39. I used the PBS poll, which was actually at 40. I‚Äôm not sure why this is such a drastic difference to you ... most of the rest of my posts are cut and pasted from all different media.
Bob Segal since most of us haven't done polls, I perceive it's at least 20% higher than that.

Bog Segal Certainly but  if you are paying $500  per inch of wall I am sure it is poor value, especially as walls already exist in the most strategic places. I am not arguing against additional barriers. Trump has claimed down from 2000 miles of wall which was clearly ridiculous as natural barriers exist over much of the border. Why ignore the border with Canada?  How much will it cost to compensate the farmers and other businesses along the wall which will have access to the river removed? If Trump plans to build the wall in the middle of the river that would explain the cost, but a raft upstream could quickly come down either side.  Trump currently said $5.7 billion without releasing the costings or locations. That is a considerable sum to spend on a pig in a poke.

Bonnie Brown you guys are still talking about Hilary? SMDH
Bonnie Elwood McMillin there‚Äôs 3 branches of government - seems like the recent election results in congress indicate a different point of view that also needs to be considered. Trump also said Mexico would pay for the wall- it‚Äôs a big difference to now ask the American tax payer to fund a $5 billion vanity project
Bonnie Massey how do we tell President Trump we want him to resign I think that there should be a petition for all Americans to be able to sign

I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I HAD A FIRM GRASP ON THE SITUATION...
Border wall and border security definitely provides protection, but if the wall is not built then foreign aid to build nations to prevent war and a recession would be affected. United States generous foreign aid to nations is vital to prevent a world war and economic disaster due to climate change
Borders are fine.
Borders can be safe with other means look into those and stop holding federal workers hostage
Boring.
Boris Nikolayev RUSSIAN TROLL ALERT!

Both chuck and Nancy voted for over 350mi of wall under Obama, the only reason why they didn't take a deal for daca is because they are trying to save face and be "team players".  If Obama was still pres and asking for less then 260mi of wall... Well we already saw how they cast their vote.  All these leftists who think chuck and Nancy are playing for then are dense idiots.
Both sides are afraid he will fix things?? That makes zero sense. What's it like to live in your brain I wonder.
Both sides are afraid you'll fix things, it gives them less to fight about and less to feel 'needed'. Keep it up!
Bowa Marita WHAT?

Brent Robinson   NATIONAL EMERGENCY üö® NATIONAL EMERGENCY üö® NATIONAL EMERGENCY üö®  Don‚Äôt let that traitor stop you from protecting America .   BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL !
Brent Robinson  Brent, two questions,   1. who admitted that he owned the shutdown mantle?  2. Why should a wall be built that 67% of Americans CLEARLY DON‚ÄôT WANT.  Why should two thirds be held hostage to one third?  Please answer these two questions without name calling or deflections?
Brent Robinson  Representatives, please put US citizen‚Äôs rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it‚Äôs more efficient, and they don‚Äôt throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities‚Äô computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S. Constituents, if you ‚Äòlike‚Äô this, like it whenever you see it.   https://m.facebook.com/The-Great-1461-Day-Adventure-360025854356893/
Brent Robinson  They don‚Äôt care how many people die? Where are you getting your information from Brent?  They?  Who are they? They can‚Äôt allow to keep fulfilling his campaign promises?  What are you talking about?  trump has had two years time and the support of both houses and he couldn‚Äôt get his promised wall built. Neither has he collected the funds he promised he would from Mexico.  The state of trump‚Äôs approval is all down to himself and no one else.  Those who oppose trump are not traitors Brent, they simply think he is not fit for office.
Brent Robinson  Trump and his family are the swamp!
Brent Robinson , Do you feel the same way about gun control so that there aren't  ANY  MORE mass shootings but because it done by WHITE AMERICANS LET THEM KEEP HAPPENING,
Brent Robinson , what if the Mexicans decided to build stairs on their side of the wall?
Brent Robinson - What high approval rating?   https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/
Brent Robinson 100% spot on!
Brent Robinson Donny is sealing his fate as a one-term president!  Bwahahahahaha!!  Talk about obvious statements...EVERYONE agrees we need border security.  What we don‚Äôt need is his cost-ineffective wall.  Donny needs to agree to the bipartisan deal already passed by Congress so his shutdown does not completely destroy our economy.  Just give it up now and reopen our government!!!  Trump doubles down on border wall, as polls show voters turning against his shutdown strategy...  https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doubles-down-on-border-wall-as-polls-show-voters-turning-against-his-shutdown-strategy
Brent Robinson First off, Trumps approval rating is of his own making. Secondly everything in your post is right from the Republican Party playbook.
Brent Robinson He doesn't have a high approval rating.
Brent Robinson He should have started in 2017 when the republicans were the majority he wouldn‚Äôt be playing the blame game,
Brent Robinson I think alot of Dems will be changing their party for 2020 after this BULLSHIT!
Brent Robinson Is From Boca Raton, Florida

Brent Robinson biggest tax scam for corporations and the wealthy... proven fact...
Brent Robinson fact, you to can even look this up, worse monthly approval rating during his first two years then any President ever. True fact dumb dumb
Brent Robinson he has a high approval rating?  Stop watching FAUX so called news
Brent Robinson high approval rating. Are you retarded. Really!

Brent Robinson keep up the great work. Your posts have been spot on and lay out the right positions we need. As for the false data offered from the Washington Post, that paper might as well say Communism on Display with Fat Liars across the front page. That paper is not worthy of the litter box.
Brent Robinson mr President we urge you to get the check from Mexico because, everybody, WHOS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL.. MEXICO
Brent Robinson name ONE campaign promise he has accomplished.  Clinton is still free. There is no wall He added more garbage to the swamp. He has failed to do everything he promised he would so far.
Brent Robinson those minority parties are so powerful!!!!!  So much for his being strong, effective, a winner.  Looks like he's a whining loser from this vantage.
Brent Robinson what high approval rating. . .38%
Brent Robinson wrong trumps ratings are down and any thing hes says or does is for his ratings
Brent Robinson yes we have to stop traitors ..get rid of trump
Brent Robinson you don‚Äôt care about people dying to fucking moron so just stop it. If you did you‚Äôd be petitioning for more gun control or less wars or action on climate change. But you aren‚Äôt doing that are you? No. What you care about is stopping brownish colored people from entering the country because you‚Äôre a xenophobic asshole.
Brent Robinson, you've just described the GOP. Lol! Except...where in hell did you find a poll that suggests The Moron has a high approval rating? More than 50% disapprove at this point. He's losing his baseless base bigly.
Brent Robinson. Maybe u.and the rest of u.morans and that includes trump.should worry about the problems in our own country before u.think about walls that dont even make sence that r.being dug under anyways.doesnt make sence what so ever.use ur.brain.    We have kids dying in schools at a very bad rate.but u.rep.and trump doesnt care about these kids. There r.shootings here in the u.s.in every dame city at a very high rate and its not immigrants doing this.its americans killing each other .people dying every dame 5 mins in this country.but do u.republicans care.hell no. Demestic.violince on a daily basis.being killed.drunk drivers killing innocent people.  Drive bys.  Gangs killings.robberies.    But nobody wants to talk about this bullshit that is what trump should be focused on. Not boarder walls where theres not a dame problem to begin with.    The national guards r.saying over and over again.drugs r.comming in on airplans.and the waters...u.no this.trump nos this.but u.want to play ignorance and support a man who wont listen to the truth like urselves.    Ur.only reason for trump to do this wall is so u.all can say look he kept his promise.  What about his promise for medical.this is the reason y.he lost the house.people want medical insurance not a stupid f.wall that there going to dig under anyways.  Get it threw ur.heads.
Brent Robinson. What high approval rating? He only has high approval among racists and idiots. Out here in the real world he's at about 30%.
Brent...you're correct..I agree with you.
Brent: All Trump supporters should work for free during the shutdown, just like the 800k federal workers Trump didn‚Äôt mention. Put your money where your mouth is!
Brett Beardsley  Lyin Donnie couldn‚Äôt fix a paper cut with a band aid...he‚Äôd destroy the band aid trying to get it out of its wrapper

Bryan Allen Social Security and medicare support themselves. They are not increasing the debt. The tax break for the wealthy, Trumps constant visits to his properties, his cabinets excess spending. Those are whats increasing the debt. The dems are in agreement for broader security however it has to make sense. Why have a broader wall and its know that tunnels are build under walls.

Build the wall.  If you have to declare a National Emergency, do it!  Whatever it takes to get it done.  Not next week, not next month, or next year.  Every day that is delayed gives Pelosi and Schumer that much longer to dig their heels in.  She has already said even if the government shutdown ends, she will still oppose funding the wall.  What more does the President need?  Speaker Pelosi is going to do whatever she can to see that her party gains full power for 2020.

But Trump do you realize how many families in America are going to be going hungry as long as you keep the government shut down? A lot of them DO have jobs but need food stamps too because they don‚Äôt make enough to pay their bills AND buy food! And what about the elderly and disabled who barely make enough on social security to pay their bills so they can‚Äôt afford to save money for food and other things?
But a wall doesn't solve any problems. Fight for something that makes sense - like stopping climate change.
But do you live here now? If not, what concern is our politics yours?
But most people with a brain don't Donald, only you and your minions!
But no. I thankfully, am neither of those groups :D
But not at your expense, holding the American people hostage is not making America great again. Leave my people alone. Pay the federal workers, stop playing Hilter, I am tired of your lying, cheating ass. You are an humiliation and a joke. Honorable men don't hold families hostage
But then he has no hostages. That won't work to get his own way.
But true Norma Beran.
But trump still thinks he can ‚Äúgrab ‚Äòem by the pu$$y‚Äù.
But you also said Mexico would pay for the wall not the US citizens and not spuriously through savings from the replacement for NAFTA.
But you did NOTHING in your first two years in office! Meanwhile, more than 1,500 criminal aliens were CONVICTED of homicide and more than 3,700 CONVICTED of sexual assault. (SOURCE: Dept. of Homeland Security, testimony presented to Congress in an open hearing. July 2018) ... But you and Jared focused on getting the prison reform bill passed -- which was a high priority for Dems -- without demanding they provide funding for the wall. Pathetic.
But your party had control of the houses to pass this bill......now you wanna play victim. Gtfo here you fraud
But, you lied about Mexico paying for it so now you want the US tax payer to foot the bill.
BuzzFeed
By all means fight, but what your doing isn‚Äôt working try fighting the problem from within. Make the people want to stay where they are.
By and large, border towns do NOT want this stupid, expensive and USELESS wall.   They say it daily (read below) and most Texans have agreed to file a class action lawsuit against Emperor Fullofshiticus if he ever tries eminent domain. Following is an excerpt from today‚Äôs news:   ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Not a Wall,‚Äô but Steel Slats and Barbed Wire Roil a Border Town  By Jose A. Del Real Jan. 23, 2019 CALEXICO, Calif. ‚Äî The barbed wire overhead evokes danger and violence, but Maritza Hurtado cannot take it seriously. When the sharp coils were placed on top of the old border fence several months ago, running right along the main boulevard, she chalked it up to political propaganda from a White House that does not understand life along the Southwest frontier.  ‚ÄúThis is not a war zone,‚Äù Ms. Hurtado said from her tax and immigration consulting office in downtown Calexico, from which she can peer into Mexico. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a business here for 30 years and we‚Äôve never needed the barbed wire. Why now? To me, it feels as if I‚Äôm enclosed.‚Äù  For nearly a year, President Trump has pointed with pride to a renovation project replacing two miles of border fencing in Calexico. He hailed it as ‚Äúthe start of our Southern Border WALL!‚Äù ‚Äî to the great consternation of many of the town‚Äôs residents, who are wary of becoming the public face of a hard-line immigration policy that most here do not agree with. The attention the president‚Äôs tweet brought was surreal, in part because the construction replaced an unsightly stretch of steel fencing that was already there.  Nationally, partisans and journalists began to debate whether the 30-foot-tall steel slats that make up the replacement barrier should be called a ‚Äúwall‚Äù like the one Mr. Trump promised during his campaign. Others said it was just a ‚Äúfence,‚Äù a distinction that has taken on great importance in Washington.  Lost amid the battle over credit and semantics was how Calexico residents themselves felt about becoming characters in Trump-era political theater. For many, a sense of apprehension turned to anger when the military installed barbed wire on top of older border fencing, which runs through downtown.  ‚ÄúThis community is basically being used for political purposes,‚Äù said Ms. Hurtado, who served as the town‚Äôs mayor until December. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs happening throughout these border cities that are just like ours.‚Äù She tried to remain diplomatic when television news crews asked her for comment about the barrier last spring, she said, to ‚Äúavoid making more drama for this community that has nothing to do with the national problem.‚Äù
By the way anyway they're trying to find a way in the office to impeach him so who's going to be the next president after that happens because I know y'all don't have my vote
By the way this all started in December when the Republicans held all of Congress, but it's the Dems fault? You guys are lemmings!
By the way, I know you hate FACT CHECKING, but San Diego does NOT have a border wall, and that is NOT why it is such a safe city! Idiot! I cannot believe #45 is "in charge" of this country. To the Trumpers- how much ignorance can you actually put up with>????? it is pathetic when you have people like Ted Nugent saying to "shoot Democrats like coyotes". (Newsweek) YES, he said that and he is the one who has much for brains, not the Parkland students! This is one of the people that #45 listens to, but oh it will not be his fault if some nut case takes a gun and starts mowing people down. And, it is a 98% chance it would be a WHITE male between the ages of 19 and 26. Again, that is a FACT, and I know you hate that word! Get a damn clue!
C C & P ... Exactly what President Trump  üá∫üá∏ & most Americans say to Congress. Don't blame it all on, clueless Nancy & Chuck.
CALL NATIONAL EMERGENCY, REMOVE ALL ILLEGALS FROM OUR COUNTRY AND STOP THROWING DEALS AT THE WITCH. GROW SOME BALLS PRES. TRUMP AND PUT NANCY IN HER PLACE ONCE AND FOR ALL.
CALL TO ACTION ::: Get Pelosi removed as Speaker by a vote of NO CONFIDENCE. Pelosi is not dealing in good faith for our country.   Citizens - write a letter, make a call....  lobby your Congress person asking that they put forth a motion to elect someone else as Speaker of the House.  The majority party can put forth a vote of NO CONFIDENCE- if successful followed by a new election for a speaker.
CHARGE THE DEMO RATS FOR AIDING AND ABETTING ILLEGALS

Cameron Kelley hell just let her be flown to Afghanistan and let her stay there. I guarantee once she rolls her eyes and throws her tantrum there, she for sure won‚Äôt come back.
Campaign sponsored propaganda is not "real news".
Can tell when pulosi is lying she moves her lips .
Can we go around Nancy Pelosi? Can we go straight to the House Democrats, or is Nancy Pelosi the only one that can bring a measure to the floor and have it voted on?
Can we impeach Pelosi and Schumer?
Can we put Nancy on the other side after you build it?
Can we put Nancy on the other side once it‚Äôs done the wall man
Can we put her on the other side once it‚Äôs done?
Can we set up a go fund me page for all those federal employees who are not getting a pay check?
Can we start by removing the idiots? You know like the ones that actually think a bill needs to be passed to see what‚Äôs in it. Cough Pelosi cough. Like seriously how the hell did she keep her job after that statement.
Can you blaim him for that ?
Can you cut all the house pay until they negotiate? If it affects there pockets maybe they will work. They are acting like naraccistic children.
Can‚Äôt fix a fool or tool Mr. creepy orange thing
Can‚Äôt put them at Nancy‚Äôs place she has a wall and security guards.
Can‚Äôt you fire that woman
Care to discuss those kids wearing your fucking hats, taunting a war veteran? Oh...an native...native meaning 'my people were here for several thousand years before your people stole the land, poisoned the air and water and murdered most of us.'   MAGA=Make America Genocidal Again.  White kids in MAGA hats, shouting 'build that wall' at American Indians. Your wall isn't about border security. It's about white supremacy.
Careful conservatives. TROLL Is a new word to get banned on FB. 72 hour ban for saying troll.
Carl Norman  Sad for you!
Carl Ostendarp   an old English word not often used over the years,   "trumpery" !
Carl Ostendarp  Do you even think before you write your senseless crap. I don't think so.I'm a true american and I vote for who's good for my country. Tell me why did Nancy & Chucky vote for a wall when Obummer was in office but now they don't. They just don't give a dam about the U.S.A. All they want is power. I mean I have 2 brain cells that rub together and create though. It's a no brainer. The zombies that hate President Trump because he showed that the democrats in office hate us because they don't want to the power that they have they just want more. Wake up the dream is here and not the nightmare. Best wishes from an american who loves his country. And if you don't like it then leave and try to find a better one. Because you may look but you're never find it.
Carl Ostendarp Why are you backing the communist? Are you one?
Carl Ostendarp You are absolutely wrong and inept . Better change the channel and realize you are being lied to 24/7
Carl Ostendarp duh its just a comment.   It's won't happen of course, but its not right for federal employees to go without and all the politicians have no worry in the world financially, which is why they won't  budge. It doesn't directly affect them
Carl Ostendarp he did take responsibility for shutting it down.  But Democrats are responsible for keeping it down for this long.
Carl Ostendarp yup thats what the idiot said! I think he self proclaimed being "the greatest negotiator". What a fake Lol

Carol Cooper Prickett Get Mexico to pay for that idiotic wall!!!!!!!!!
Carol Fontana yes, they do and they also offer the details. I‚Äôve learned a lot. I started out watching Fox , a presser, snd immediately turn to CNN... they lie and spin.
Carol White but illegal immigration is how most of them make most of their money and acquire most of their support.
Carol Wolfgram Yeah -- approval rating üôÑ . How was his approval rating when he won 306 -227 in 2016  ?-- no chance as I remember üòé . ( oh .. and don't start with the 'popular vote' bs --  we go by the Constitution in this country ).
Carol Wolfgram you do know polls only poll a small portion of the population  right?  I think it's getting higher. People are walking away from the Democrat party.  The illegals are replacing their lost votes. Why do you think they want open borders. Think critically.
Carole Conaway wrong
Carolyn Alexander  better Question is why did she and the other Congress members all take there whole family‚Äôs , did they plan to come back ? 8 members of Congress 85 family members? 93 in total .
Carolyn Alexander Government business does not occur just within Washington D.C. or solely on U.S. Soil.
Carolyn Alexander probably because Dotard sits on his fat A‚Äî and DOES ABSOUTLY NOTHING!
Carolyn Alexander she thinks she‚Äôs better than everybody else
Carolyn Alexander why wasn‚Äôt Trump offering to back down? She has the power here and Trumps poll numbers are dropping.
Catherine D'Amore- Piazza why are you so afraid üò± ?  We‚Äôre you this scared before trump told you to be? Did you ever even think about a southern border wall before trump told you to?
Catherine Willoughby I guess you wouldn't understand then
Catherine Willoughby it takes two to tango at least he wasn't going on a all expenses paid trip with friends and family.

Chad Kienitz Do you know how many AMERICAN BORN KILLERS ARE SITTING ON DEATH ROW EATING THREE MEALS A DAY GETTING MEDICAL ATTENTION.  You will not save this country with a wall period.  DONALD TRUMP "FOLLOWERS" OPEN YOUR EYES AND WIPE YOUR OWN ASS AND THINK FOR YOURSELF AND YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY AMERICANS ARE, ARE CURRENTLY, SUFFERING NOW OVER A WALL. THE HUMAN TRAFFIC SCANDAL IN ARIZONA ALLLLLLLLL AMERICAN BORN POLITICIANS!!! CRIMINALS COME IN ALL NATIONALITIES AND THE BIGGEST CRIMINAL OF ALL IS IN CHARGE OF THIS COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T CARE WHO HE STEPS ONNNNN!! NOT OVER ON!! This is a political statement.  This wall is the most ridiculous thing ever.  "Followers" who can't wipe their own ass and who are waiting on Donald Trump to tell them when to jump and how high voted for this terrorist because they can't think for themselves.  DONALD TRUMP is a TERRORIST: a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
Chammy Ney Ney Jr.   Representatives, please put US citizen‚Äôs rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it‚Äôs more efficient, and they don‚Äôt throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities‚Äô computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S.

Chloe Lexington what crimes did they commit? Name one crime did the Trump family committed.
Chris Jordan G  "Dictate what he wants," Chris! He wants a wall! WE WANT A SECURITY WALL!!! His main campaign promise was that he would build a wall for border security, and he is trying to fulfill that campaign promise to the voters that won his election.
Chris Jordan G ----Poor whittle BOT !!
Chris Jordan G ---I can read and do research,APPARENTLY YOU CAN'T, poor thing !!
Chris Jordan G Baby Trump?  What‚Äôs your problem?
Chris Jordan G Mark Morgan border patrol chief under Obama has been on the news saying we need the wall.
Chris Jordan G Obama destroyed 50 % of it all ready . Trumps rebuilding.. 2020
Chris Jordan G bringing jobs to all Americans, signing a bill to back pay shutdown employees, making foreign countries pay their fair share instead of us fitting the bill....bring on the destruction. You have to be a freakin idiot to make such claims. But please preach on dumbass it's very entertaining üôÑ
Chris Jordan G keep showing yourself. People like you are why people are changing partiesü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇ
Chris Jordan G lol now how is that please tell us Americans
Chris Jordan G speaking of babies, you certainly do not care if another baby is trafficked or another Angel Mom is added to the list, shameful!
Chris Jordan G those children are not dead! A lot of them were unaccompanied and some were with people smuggling them over. But no sense in talking to someone who supports child trafficking and heartless who doesnt care if measures are taken to NOT add ONE more Angel Moms to the list. Oh by the way people are numb to Dems name calling now.
Chris Jordan G what was the compromise coming from the Democrats? I have yet to hear one besides more border agents.
Chris Jordan G worry about your own country! Those of us with brains LOVE our President Trump!
Chris Jordan G you are a child
Chris Jordan G you need the best therapy money can buy! Talk about delusional! Wow!!!!
Chris Jordan G, Obama had the same plan, with the same technology only 6 years ago. And it passed through Congress with only 19 nays. So apparently Democrats were in favor as well.
Chris Jordan G, you claim Trump is destroying or nation. Can you at least tell us in your mind how?  My guess you‚Äôre just spewing Liberal hatred, prove me wrong. If you can.
Chris McCarthy How can you wish such a disgrace on all these American families, how will they eat, pay  their mortgage, rentals,  their bills, you and this president are a disgrace, all that is wrong with humanity.

Chris McCarthy Show me the Pesos, Chief.
Chris McCarthy There is NO crisis at the Border.  It's been proven.  He said on TV that he will #trumpshutdown the government and take credit for it.  Did he lie to YOU when he claimed Mexico would pay for the wall?  100%  ---  There has been deals...deals that he refuses to sign.  Deals he refuses to sign because of right wing media.  He is getting most of the blame for this shutdown.  And rightly so.
Chris McCarthy WHAT?
Christian families appreciate it!
Christie you read it right! He‚Äôs a baby, useless as a leader and he‚Äôs a fool of a man!
Christina Maschmeyer, I wouldn‚Äôt say there is that type of disparity, but due to the Trump supporters who remain silent each and every week, I‚Äôd think it could be mote around the 2-4% range.

Cindy Cripps-Prawak   What's mean spirited is the fact that democrats care more about the illegals than they do the voters that elected them.  Why do Democrats support and defend illegal immigration, even declaring "sanctuary cities and States", and also resist voter ID?  How does supporting illegal immigration and fraudulent voting benefit the average US citizen? Any citizen?  How could anyone vote for any Democrat and think themselves a patriot?
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  Get ready. Our economic refugees are coming to your country this spring and summer.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  I agree we have a liar and possibly a KBG Russian agent  trying to sale this nation for Russia
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  I think you're on the wrong side of the world. You should go to China N.Korea, or Iran to name a few.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  The ball is in Pelosi hands now. Let‚Äôs see if she‚Äôll come back with a counter offer to Trumps offer. ...Nope. No counter offer. Democrats don‚Äôt want to negotiate. They leave town. NOBODY in Congress should leave town until they hash this out so people can get back to work and get paid. The wall is for border security. We must have. The shutdown is democrats now. Putting politics before people.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  With statements like this, you show your true ignorance.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  You mean like your buddy Bill Clinton did for 21 days and Obama did for 16 .
Cindy Cripps-Prawak  he offered them a deal. The ball is in the democrats court now. Blame it on the democrats.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak . Aww he‚Äôs just so mean üò¢üò¢üò¢ do you need a tissue ? Perhaps a safe place to cry it out ?
Cindy Cripps-Prawak ..I dont see anybody being held for ransom. When they took their jobs, they knew there were possibilities of shutdowns.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak 220-195. Enough said
Cindy Cripps-Prawak : oh damn, are you ignorant.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak A conclusion reached through selective facts to prop up a belief or opunion, not all facts then letting THEM reveal truth...
Cindy Cripps-Prawak DONALD TRUMP IS A TERRORIST... a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak Excuse me, but who is doing this?  Who is refusing to negotiate?  Not Trump but your little witch hag.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak How did you get so clueless? Are you paid to parrott the corrupt dems and msm? How much did it take to make you a communist?
Cindy Cripps-Prawak I agree.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak I think it's Nancy!
Cindy Cripps-Prawak I think you meant to say Pelosi/Schumer instead of President Trump. What you mentioned is exactly what they're doing. The dems don't care thing one about us. We are beyond disposable to them. The more of us who have our lives taken by illegals the more of those same illegals can come here. Its a win/win for them. Sadly Cindy...people like you won't get it until one of your loved ones is murdered by an illegal. No doubt if the dems get their way you won't have long to wait for that to happen.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak It‚Äôs Pelosi and Chuckles who won‚Äôt negotiate! The Federal employees will be paid and in the mean time the banks will work with them.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak Just like Obama did! Maybe Trump should fine all the libtards who don‚Äôt support the wall... like Obama did!!!
Cindy Cripps-Prawak Nancy could end this, but she has some important stuff to do first. Just think about that a minute
Cindy Cripps-Prawak Our President took the grief of this shutdown to get something done. Pelosi has done nothing but flit around and LIE.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak Pelosi caused the shutdown even though he is doing what she said MUST be done in a speech in 2008.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak Shameless is what Dems are?
Cindy Cripps-Prawak We WILL secure our nation. You should move to iran
Cindy Cripps-Prawak You sure are, Cindy!
Cindy Cripps-Prawak dems could care less about American's. Walkaway
Cindy Cripps-Prawak even Government Employees not receiving pay are for the wall!

Cindy Cripps-Prawak have you not been paying attention. Trump has been inviting the dems to negotiate a solution and they keep turning him down. It‚Äôs his fault right?  Give me a break
Cindy Cripps-Prawak http://dlvr.it/Qx3hxn
Cindy Cripps-Prawak it is the demoncrats that are keeping the government shut down. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS FUND THE WALL TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE!
Cindy Cripps-Prawak it seems that Trump is the only one trying to open the government. He went from a wall to fence sections and offered everything that the Dems wanted. Security on the southern border is a real concern and must be fixed. But liberals like illegals voting for them
Cindy Cripps-Prawak it‚Äôs over, idiot. Keep up. Did you think it was shameful when Barry and billy did it?  You‚Äôre on welfare.  You Canadians need to stick to your own business.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak it‚Äôs the Democrats that are holding the employees of the government for ransom! President Trump is trying to negotiate while Democrats do nothing! They are the bullies!! The president is trying to protect our great nation!! I stand behind the President #Buildthewall #Trump2020
Cindy Cripps-Prawak keep your opinions in Canada. Anything you say is irrelevant.
Cindy Cripps-Prawak let one of your loved ones get killed by these criminal/gang member illegals and see how u feel then! Build that wall!! Trump 2020!!
Cindy Cripps-Prawak let's go with your argument. Did you feel the same way when Obama did it with his BS Obama care?
Cindy Cripps-Prawak like Obama did during the shutdown during his presidency?
Cindy Cripps-Prawak lol
Cindy Cripps-Prawak more like the Democrats
Cindy Cripps-Prawak my God woman can't you think for yourself those are Nancy's talking points lol

Cindy Cripps-Prawak ü§îüôÑ
Cindy Cripps-Prawak, well, he's tried to negotiate twice but mean spirited Nancy simply said "no". Seems like that's where the shame lays. It's really sad that 800,000 Americans are without paychecks but 2 MILLION illegals got theirs. Exactly what do you have against LEGAL immigration and border security?
Cindy Cripps-Prawak. Did you not listen.... he is giving them 90% of what they want!!!!
Cindy Kidder Foster you republicans need to stop spreading those lies. Obama had more illegals deported then any other. You need to come to the times and see the truth. Donnie is not the truth
Cindy Melhorn more than Boehner did?  Doubtful.
Cindy if you would stop watching CNN fake news you would know that Nancy Pelosi is the one that‚Äôs mean spirited and she won‚Äôt meet with President Trump.She to busy taking vacations.The shutdown is because of Nancy Pelosi.
Claudine Sherman Abraham That's not an IRS refund. üôÑ
Clearly so triggered he hid from me :D
Clinton started it. Bush and Obama built it. Trump just wants to continue what DEMOCRATS started.   The battle over expanding the US-Mexico border fence has shut down the government.  #CutThroughTheNoise around the showdown over Trump's wall. https://www.facebook.com/228735667216/posts/10156420521092217/
Close the border
Close the border before the next wave of illegals gets here !!!
Close this Loop HOLE and use this $ for your damn wall!  https://www.facebook.com/cory.wood.505/videos/2448828438465023/
Clueless fool needs to find a way to resign.  But he can't plea-bargain until the charges against him are made public.  So he hangs around, watching Fox News and eating hamburgers, at the center of a closed government and a public that overwhelming disapproves of him and everything he stands for.
Colby Chavez  10. Reversing Obama‚Äôs Cuba policies: During the campaign, Trump promised to roll back the ‚Äúconcessions‚Äù his predecessor gave to Cuba. In 2017, Trump reinstated some restrictions, but largely left many of Obama‚Äôs measures in place.  Want more? I‚Äôve got plenty!
Colby Chavez  2. Exiting from the Iran deal: Calling it ‚Äúdecaying and rotten,‚Äù Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018. By November, the Trump administration said it restored previously lifted sanctions on Iran. Trump had promised to tear up the deal while on the campaign trail.
Colby Chavez  3. Creating a hotline for veterans: By November 2017, the Department of Veterans Affairs said a 24-hour White House hotline was fully functional to help veterans ‚Äì fulfilling one of Trump‚Äôs campaign promises. Veterans are able to connect with an actual person via the speciqal line.
Colby Chavez  4. Taking no salary: Trump promised not to take the $400,000 presidential salary. He‚Äôs kept that promise, donating portions of the money to various Cabinet departments.
Colby Chavez  5. Blocking White House officials‚Äô foreign lobbying: One of the very first campaign promises Trump kept was banning White House officials for life from lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. This, he achieved by way of an executive order.
Colby Chavez  6. Exiting from the Paris climate accord: As a candidate, Trump promised to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù the Paris Climate Agreement, a pact by nearly 200 nations to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change. Former President Barack Obama used his power as president to join the agreement without a vote in the legislature. Trump announced in June 2017 that the U.S. was pulling out of the agreement.
Colby Chavez  7. Moving a key embassy: In May 2018, Trump fulfilled a key campaign promise by opening the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem and recognizing the city as the ‚Äútrue capital‚Äù of Israel. The international community largely does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital as it is claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians. Previously, the U.S. kept its embassy in Tel Aviv, like other countries.
Colby Chavez  8. Ending Obama‚Äôs health care law: Trump often promised to ‚Äúcompletely repeal‚Äù the Affordable Care Act, widely known as ObamaCare. That hasn‚Äôt happened ‚Äì despite multiple legislative attempts ‚Äì but Trump has dismantled portions of the landmark health care law throughout his presidency. His administration rolled back the individual and contraceptive mandates, paved the way for ‚Äúalternatives‚Äù to health insurance and ended certain cost-sharing subsidy payments.
Colby Chavez  Approving tax cuts: As a candidate, Trump promised to simplify the tax code and create massive cuts for Americans. He signed the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul with the most extensive rewrite of the tax code in decades in December 2017. It cut the corporate tax rate and doubled the standard deduction, among numerous other changes.
Colby Chavez 9. Reducing North Korea‚Äôs nuclear arsenal: Trump said he would talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un regarding his nuclear arsenal during the campaign ‚Äì and the pair did meet in June 2018. However, there‚Äôs been little tangible progress on the vague denuclearization agreement the two reached at that meeting in Singapore. In fact, since then, several private analysts have published reports detailing continuing North Korean development of nuclear and missile technology.
Coleman...Now I understand why you are an idiot... you were in the Navy!!!!
Colita K Williamson I suppose you hate people having jobs and getting increases in their wages. The influx of illegals have stifled wages for years.but I'm going to guess that doesn't matter to you because you probably don't work or if you do you work for the government.
Colleen Marshall Vaneps you do know that's a lot like saying don't worry I know you're starving now but I'll feed you next month
Com on com on
Come on Nancy. #justbuildit
Come to Iraq and let the US Army take the lead in Iraq and fire the militas and fake Shiaa politicians that they pretend they are Religious people
Comment by Virginia's husband a 22 year Navy veteran. In my opinion, instead of canceling Pelosi and her gaggle's departure flight to Afghanistan....it would have been more effective to cancel their RETURN flight. MAGA...BUILD THAT WALL!!!
Commie Trudeau bad for Canada.
Communist are the real problem. THey have no socialist agenda. Marx was a cousin to the Rothchillds bankers. He likes to frame the capitalists for the greed of the real 1% whom are not white corporate men.
Communists whom are not socialists have no socialist agenda. Commies sit on the left to destroy all democratic progress then cry democracy can never work. Karl Marx was a commie cousin to the Rothchildds bankers. Whiet corporate men are not the 1% and never owned slavery nor the colony. Belfour Declaration never should have been signed.
Compromise?  ‚ÄúHe is shutting down the government to break his signature campaign promise. His signature campaign promise was that the taxpayers weren‚Äôt going to have to pay for it.‚Äù The House Armed Services Committee Chairman said on ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù
Comrade Trump is a liar, crook, thief, cheater, bigot, incompetent, stupid, lazy, con artist, and a traitor. He needs to resign.
Comrade Trump will be proud of you
Comrade stooge motherfucka individual 1 we would tell Nancy but there is no point she ain‚Äôt the President of the United States dumbass #TFA #ImpeachThatMotherfucka #GoBackToRussiaTraitor #HateHasNoHomeHere
ConMan Trumpoganda. Using someone‚Äôs pain to stir lies in support of his vanity wall.
Congratulations President Trump! I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre our President!
Congratulations to President Trump on your second year in office today! It is very happy and meaningful day for me too, to start again prayer for you on your inauguration day with the love of God . May God bless you and your family, your American leadership, the American people and the United States!
Congress has just built a STONE WALL around America's government!  Their leaders need to be fired now!  Work for America or get out of the way! Use executive power! - & put people back to work - end BOTH crisis! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ Play your Trump card for America, now!
Connie Ramos My house hold does not want the wall as is written. We want Border Security. And happy to agree with you on who works for who! Well said!
Contact Senator Kaine....Phone: (202) 224-4024 Senator Kaine, I heard you speak on the floor (1/18/19) how you empathize with the Government employees who are not receiving their paychecks. How a woman with a small baby was in tears as she missed her baby because her mother in another state had to baby sit her baby since she couldn't pay for day care while not receiving her govt pay. How moving it was to hear that mother's pain. Yet, what is more moving is the pain that Americans have been forced to feel every moment of every day because an Illegal has killed their loved one. So many American mothers miss their children whom they will NEVER see again because they were murdered by an illegal. The pain that Millions of Americans experience because an illegal has maimed them, raped them, attacked, harassed, stolen their ID, their property, their quality of life. I believe the pain of these Americans, at the hands of illegals, far exceeds the temporary "pain" expressed by those who aren't getting a paycheck as our President fights for ALL Americans by securing our border. Our President fights for ALL Americans, while you continue to fight for illegals and only a few Americans during this shut down. Fund the wall, build the wall, and fight for U.S ALL!  Respectfully,  Ms dawncee
Continue your "mockery" though :D
Cora Pantoja Clinton is not president now. We are in the #metoo era NOW. Its shameful that women like you, are trying to normalize sexual misconduct.
Cora Pantoja yeah you do. Illegal wars, so called nation building, failed Pax Americana, millions killed or displaced, Europe overrun with so called war migrants etc, etc etc

Curt Moser WHAT?
Curtis Rudisail not sure whether you really don't know or you are trying to be a smart ellic. I will accept it as the first one. It is someone who has a family member, most often child killed by an illegal immigrant. Most of the time it is not the first time the illegal immigrant has committed crimes before besides being here illegally.
Cut COST I DON'T KNOW WHY HE SAID OVER  HARVEST MEAT PRICES WILL DROP IF THE FRAM RAISED LIVE STOCK  CHICKEN SHOULD BE EXPENSIVE CAUSE LOOK AT LIVE STOCK EGG  SHOULD BE 1
Cut the Senator‚Äôs and Congessmen‚Äôs pay during the shutdown and things will start to work your way
Cynthia Forney  You cannot have border security without a strong physical barrier.  Do you remember 9/11?  We've gotten too complacent.  Do we need another terror attack to get you people to understand that?
DACA is disappointing. First: We've had 7 amnesty programs since 1986. If ANYONE was had the opportunity at amnesty and didn't take it - then it should be off the table for them (for kids, I'd give it 2). Second: Anyone that has been here 5 years or less does not have ties to this country - they still have ties to their former country - deport them! So you are dealing with people from 2000-2013. Then ALL DACA applicants must be vetted - if they have committted ANY other crime - they are deported. Third: They should NEVER gain citizenship, a green card to allow them to stay maybe, but not citizenship. Breaking the  law should never be rewarded like that. Fourth: They should be ineligible for welfare. Fifth: Their ability to stay should not be the reason for parents, siblings, aunts, uncles to stay....it should not be a means to chain migration. We, as a country, need to send a strong message to the rest of the world - we welcome LEGAL immigrants, but if you come illegally you WILL BE deported!
DACA was an Illegal Law by EO by obama who had no authority to create a Law, only Congress can create Laws and DACA was never voted on by the Congress therefore it is an Illegal law and Trump should be getting it to the SCOTUS to overturn it not give those who are in America Illegally Social Security. Period. #NODACADeal
DAY 30: America's longest shutdown is now a month old.

The FAA is inadequately staffed to perform safety inspections on a regular schedule. 9. Air Traffic Controllers, who were already suffering a 30-year staffing low, have been feeling the strain of going unpaid. Some have begun quitting. 10. With 41% of the FDA laid off, some food safety inspections have stopped. 11. With 5,000 staffers laid off, the FBI reports that investigations have slowed. 12. Food and health programs for Native Americans have lost funding. 13. National parks are overflowing with garbage and human waste. Trees at Joshua Tree national park have been vandalized or destroyed. 14. The backlog of immigration cases is growing. 15. Farmers are not receiving federal subsidies that were intended to help them cope with the impact of Pres. Trump's tariffs. 16. EPA pollution inspectors are not working. 17. Tax refunds may not be sent out on time. 18. The IRS is unable to answer taxpayers' questions. 19. Small businesses in Washington, D.C. are losing their customers. 20. NASA has stoped research. 21.

Dave Mosley Jr.  The dynamics of that changed when Democrats refuse to negotiate anything. Congress has one main job. Pass a budget. That hasn‚Äôt been done in decades. No business can operate without a budget.   Who has gone on vacations during the shutdown. Democrats. Who was planning on another trip with friends and family during the shutdown? Nancy. Who was planning on being out of the country and not being there to negotiate? Nancy. Who was going to be gone when yet another payroll period ended on Tuesday for the workers she claimed to care about? Nancy. Who lied about concerns for security for the SOTU address without asking Secret Service or Homeland Security first? Nancy. Who HID from Angel Families who were right outside her office? Nancy.  Who got her plane snatched out from under her? Nancy.
Dave Mosley Jr. - He has owned the shut-down.  Meanwhile, Pelosi pretends nothing is her fault.
Dave Mosley Jr. And he did at first but now at this point the continued shutdown is 100% because of Dems.
Dave Mosley Jr. The only one dilusional is you.
Dave Mosley Jr. You people! Are you calling us You's? How dare you call us a YOU. Oh wait I just called you a you. :) Lighten up.
Dave Mosley Jr. he can own it with all the people supporting him.. at what point do you say enough is enough with the caravans and ILLEGAL immigration? At what point are our resources so taxed you say enough? How many legal citizens have to die before saying enough? Let the ammo fly at the border and see how long it takes for other countries to realize we aren't joking about stopping the flow of illegals... use them drones and sensors to give plenty of advanced warning to those that would still dare to try.. how would you personally fix this? Any ideas or just more bitching cause your candidate lost...
Dave Van Houten WHAT?
David Ferguson I know my Dad, he isn't some neglectful figment of your deluded imagination. What does that have to do with Moron Don starving hard working government employees to feed his ego?

David Owens Jeffcoat Read the First Amendment.  It guarantees freedom of religion.  Nowhere is a specific religion mentioned.  Any views to the contrary are unAmerican.
David Owens Jeffcoat Yeah, proposals like arming teachers so when the cops arrive they will probably shoot some teachers too like the bar security guy the cops killed thinking he was the killer.
David Owens Jeffcoat typical reply by Trump lover‚Äî always insulting
David Schroeder Oh I get it your playing the Nancy Pelosi dummkopf CARD ‚ÄúI reject your facts.‚Äùü§°üòÇ
David Schroeder liberalism is definitely a mental disorder brother.
David White Eagle I will agree but demon-craps does not want any mediaüòù.  Remember when Schumer and Pelosi had their first meeting with President Trump.  They had cameras there and the demon-craps are just cautious about how stupid they really are.üòù
David Williams , FACTS Printed, able to verify asking because worked in that field for 20 years . How about 4 generation in one family milking the system that fine with you , getting benefits just by getting a doctor signing a letter another mom and 4 kids collecting money they never paid into making more money in a month then I did $4000 and then being told that if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have a job last name Conner
David its also too wet to snow here so there's that.

Dean Andrews. Lolol No he does not? That's why we have desperation of power. To keep all in check. We live under democracy. This it's not a dictatorship country nor will it ever be. If it work as your president chump expected we wouldn't be having this conversation right now now would we
Dean Clouse WHAT?
Dean Clouse Yeah. No. Not sure if you have noticed but the majority of Americans do not want this.
Dean Clouse if you would kindly do your research you will find that the terms have been talked about for years. Spoke about when Reps held the House. Old news. BTW doesn't matter anymore anyway. Just like Chump being Pres. It don't matter anymore coz here we are dealing with both of them.
Dean Clouse point
Dean Clouse what on God's green earth has this Russian spy done for America? Oh right! A Yuuuge tax cut for his billionaire buddies and CEO friends..have you seen the deficit since he took office? You know 200 indictments ago...The U.S. Treasury reported that October‚Äôs deficit was $100 billion, an increase of $37 billion or 58% from a year ago. While one month may not be a trend, it puts the full-year deficit on a path from $779 billion in fiscal 2018 to $1 trillion in fiscal 2019. He's a business genius? lol suckers!
Dear America and World: I have read before and I think it is still going on: Russia has been infusing the United States and other Countries with false information, propaganda and Lies through the internet and other media outlets for the past 6 years at least. They have had goals for over 20 years now to shape the geopolitical world into their image and lately, it seems Donald Trump has been obeying mass-murderer Putin's orders! I believe Freedom Outpost is just one media outlet spewing hate and Lies for Russia.

Dear Chuck and Nancy, stop bein bitches. p.s I love you Trump
Dear Mr President....Please write an EO that the House and Senate will have their paychecks stopped while the Government is shut down. If they are not getting paid, then maybe they will be willing to work at getting the wall built and getting the Government opened again.
Dear Mr. President, I applaud your speech yesterday.   You have shown that you are willing to compromise.   The democrats have shown that they don‚Äôt care about compromise at all.   They care about the 2020 elections! Not about American citizens.  Nancy Pelosi accused you of acting childish.   Well, SHE is the one being stubborn and acting childish and dare I say, acting like a bully!  I‚Äôm sure there are democrats who would sit down with you and work out a deal but they dare not do it because of the expected ‚Äúwrath‚Äú of Nancy Pelosi.  Here is a solution : end the shutdown and put these innocent government workers back to work immediately.  HOWEVER,  ask Nancy and Chuck and ALL OF CONGRESS to halt their pay AND THAT OF THEIR AIDES AND ENTOURAGE until a deal is worked out! Then everyone needs to work non-stop, 24 hours a day, until a mutual resolution is found that will protect US as American citizens.
Dear President Donald Trump unlimited amounts of Thank you to you , love ‚ù§Ô∏è you ! you are the only Billionaire President in the History of the USA who protect the safety security and interests of the citizens of the USA only! Absolutely no compromise on building of the southern borders wall! USA is unable even to take care of its very own citizens!
Dear President Trump, Nancy is not in charge you are, she is show-boating like she owns it, SHE doesn't YOU do, We the people of elected you
Dear Trump Need negotiate with one way flight to Afghanistan with booze and family with pelosi for border wall!
Dear Tump, he needs to announce it, because we need their votes for 2020 do not forget, if you do not say it, we will lose 20 million votes in 2020 we all agree algal cannot come to the U.S. but some algal been here last 20 years and they have children.
Dear trump and his supporters:  Just in case you forgot, in the USA, there is a process for bills to become laws.   Laws are not made by one party writing a bill, and simply expecting the other party to fall in lockstep, and sign the bill without research, debate, expert testimony, public testimony, amendments or changes, acceptable compromises and other measures.

Death sneaking into our nation? Even scientists are disciplined  if they dare mention  that disease crosses our border as easily as illegals from all over the world. Disease. Ebola. Banned words.   GenerationalDynamics.com  DOES report   1/20/2019  Ebola outbreak in DR Congo now spreading exponentially faster Local DRC population giving little cooperation to health officials ...........The number of Ebola cases recorded each day in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has doubled, indicating that it may spread to other regions and other countries. That it will soon travel to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and even South Sudan. The epidemic was originally centered in Beni, with a population of 232,000. But it has spread to Butamben, with a population of over a million, a densely populated trade city near the Uganda border. Further south along the highway from Butembo are the million-plus population cities Goma and Bukusu.

Deb Galarza Deb since you live nowhere near the border and have no idea what really happens here why should we give a damn about what you want?
Debbie Avdoyan Spiers the Obama administration had months of hearings on healthcare. Obama actually wanted universal healthcare but because of the opposition from the republicans he   used the Republicans healthcare bill that you are now opposed to.  Speaking of crooks you support the biggest traitor to this country.

Debbie Shaw Hurst Ford have they changed the definition of Troll to mean "Intelligent person who points and laughs at stupid people"? Or is your debate that weak?
Debi Choate is it actually Mitch McConnell who refuses to do his job and put the bill on the floor. The house passed seven bills however Mitch will not even consider them. Its not the dems fault that this is happening.
Debi Choate trump doesn‚Äôt care about anything but money - it is his only god- What happened to love your neighbor? There is no crisis- we do not need a wall
Deborah Martin  and the Funding Trump‚Äôs asking for is a pittance compared to what was already agreed upon by the Democrats some years ago !!

Defintely will go down in history as a corrupt traitor. A fluke!! His supporters will be remembered as a cult.
Demacrats only have one goal!! That is to. Bring down President Trump!! They dont care about the American people!! They are obsessed with impeaching Trump!! Finding anyway they can to do it!! That is their only goal in life!!
DemocRATS are as evil as you can get.  They hate Trump and are trying their very best to make him fail. Most of the country is behind him. This man is behind him 150%. Go Mr. President go!!
Democrat 'Progressivism' is Prime  Rothschild domination tool Creating warfare between middle and lower classes By Dick Eastman 4-18-10  The Rothschilds are promoting class warfare between the growing bottom and the diminutive middle levels of the population. Their goal is to destroy the middle forever, to create a state conditioned proletarian slave class to serve the elite.
Democrat want‚Äôs to be like communist that they care nothing but their on way. They are working only to cater illegal and big drug dealer. Those are the people are in their list. So the Democrat voters  they elected them Demorats congressman just to punch them and laugh at the voters. Unless they all cheat.
Democrats are so socialistic.  It‚Äôs really unbelievable
Democrats are trying to get people back to work and paid because their allegiance is to America. Republicans have showed they don't care about workers because their allegiance is to Donald Trump.
Democrats aren't afraid the wall won't work. They're afraid the wall WILL work- thereby stopping the drug money they are currently receiving! #TRUMP2020 #MAGA #America1STüíØ
Democrats as of this morning will not talk with any Angel families. Terrible, you don't have to be on either side to see that Democrats have there own agenda in getting power no matter what it takes. They're not America's friend, and if you stand for the Constitution of the United States their not your friend either. And I might add there not Christianity's friend either.  Reading and researching from the early years tells their true story about there agenda to change America.   The Christians will win this war in the end though when the ultimate Holy War breaks out in future time. God will always protect the United States Of America. O:) üôèüíí
Democrats can't stand someone who keeps their promise ! They lie to get elected, and promise is just politicians way to office....
Democrats don't care about American lives, as long as they get their illegals to vote for them! That's what it's all about! Trump will get our wall funding, and we will remember what the democrats have done during this shut down! Partying in Hawaii and Puerto Rico while people suffer and Americans are being murdered!
Democrats don't give a crap about the United States' security.  They also don't give a crap about the "dreamers" unless they can secure their votes for political power.  Just an absolutely disgusting bunch and anyone voting for any of them needs to reevaluate their own mental faculties.
Democrats don't give a damn about angel families. Only their potential  illegal immigrant voting base.
Democrats dont want a wall..  It would stop their future welfare votes.
Democrats hate so much President Trump that they do not see how stupid they look and sound when using the same words like they have been given order what to say...this is a communist tactic .Adults that claim that are educated but do not understand that border security  is a complicated issue ...but before everything  else you have to have a barrier to establish where will be a port of entry. Democrats want open border and like illegals and ignore American citizens...They want to open the government and than discuss border security....are they serious about it ?????. They had 4 weeks to discuss ....did they ???....With this being said we the people have to support our president.....
Democrats have become a socialist party. They no longer care about Americans. Democrats want power in order to stay in power they need illegals votes even tho they shouldn‚Äôt vote or get social security, or welfare they do.
Democrats have no interest in our country. Drive them out
Democrats have rejected a perfectly reasonable offer by Trump -DACA and TPS protection for 3 years in exchange for a steel barrier slat-fence (wall, whatever). Furthermore, not one damn Democrat politician gives two greasy craps that essential employees (ones made to work throughout the shutdown) are not being paid. We were supposed to validate our time this past Friday. Now, it‚Äôs two pay checks  that we will have missed. Retroactive pay is BS; We have bills NOW!    Do me (and other essential employees) a favor and call your Congressional representatives now!  The following bills get us paid now, but are languishing in Appropriations Committees. Refer to the bills below:  Senate Bill 111 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/111?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S+111%22%5D%7D&s=1&r=1  House Bill 371 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/371/text  House Bill 301 https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/301?s=1&r=55
Democrats like it when illegals kill Police officers and innocent civilians, Demtards have blood on their hands
Democrats like it when illegals kill Police officers and innocent civilians, Demtards have blood on their hands...
Democrats need to represent and protect AMERICAN CITIZENS not illegal aliens!
Democrats need to wake up!  I don't think their images of going to Hawaii, or Puerto Rico and having a grand time while government personnel aren't working/getting paid look too good.  Also saying that you don't like Trump's last offer before it was offered and gave you 4 out of 5 things you wanted looks good either.  Americans are smarter than you think; they know who is keeping the government shut down.  OPTICS, people!
Democrats only care about 3 things. Personal power, personal wealth, and covering up their crimes.
Democrats turned the values against the USA.  The drank Obama‚Äôs Kool side and they are fundamentally trying to change it to an open border socialist state.  One World Government so who cares where people move.
Democrats want POWER...nothing matters but POWER....they will sacrifice their own for POWER OVER THE PEOPLE......
Democrats. I‚Äôm tired of you telling me and the country lies about that the wall will not work. You say people will just dig under it. Well I say, the amount of people digging tunnels under the wall is going to be so minuscule to the amount of people it deters in the first place. Also the new wall I‚Äôm sure will be going down in the ground deep enough to discourage tunnels. It will also discourage people from making that very dangerous trip to our border. I‚Äôm tired of hearing about technology yet nobody says what kind of technology that you‚Äôre proposing. Is your technology going to stop them from stepping one foot on US soil, because if it doesn‚Äôt then we will be chasing them down and then they will be getting all the benefits & rights this country has to offer. It will also be adding to the all ready back log of 900,000 immigration court cases that are already pending. So if your technology it‚Äôs not stopping them from coming across the border in the first place then it‚Äôs just bullshittttt. Walls work, and walls are in 40 some plus countries used for protecting their borders. They are around prisons, the Vatican, the Facebook man and all the rich peoples houses.  Why do Democratic politicians have walls around their house ???  So I‚Äôm sick and tired of hearing you say walls don‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs bullshitttt, and all you liberals know is your Democratic talking points and they don‚Äôt make commonsense. Only a few years ago the Democrats voted for a wall, and there are plenty of videos to prove it.  It is only now they don‚Äôt want it because Trump campaigned on it, and it would be seen as a win for him, and Democrats can‚Äôt have that even though it makes our country safer. Democrats know that would hurt their re-election possibilities. Democrats only care about the votes that illegals can bring them. Ask yourself this question, if illegals voted for Republicans instead of Free Stuff Democrats, would that wall already been built by Democrats by now !!!!  üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Democrats would love to take away our Second amendment constitutional right of bearing arms if it could only save just one life yet they turn a blind eye to the thousands and thousands of people that have died because of a unsecured border. Can you say hypocrites !! The truth is Democrats learned over the last decade that they gained 3 million new voters if they allow illegals to jump the border. Lets not be stupid here. At some point Democrats have to see the elephant in the room.!!!  Ps. They do see that elephant but they are telling us there is no elephant and yet people believe it because they have the News Media on their side. You might ask why then is the News Media on the Democrats side??  Easy, because the Media are 90% liberal. Open your eyes to what lies you are being told. By only watching one source of news you are self censoring yourself. Out of all the news going on in this world you only here 24/7 negative news on Trump. It is impossible for anyone to do that much wrong in a booming economy. The liberal media is taking us for suckers.  How much good could we be doing for our country if Democrats were on the side of the American people and working with Trump. We are all on the same team. We are not supposed to be two separate football teams fighting each other.  We should be like ONE Football team that has a offense and defense trying to win the game together. I can‚Äôt believe how half this country can‚Äôt see this.  Jack Schoch. Yes, I wrote this and I approve my message. I‚Äôm sick of this Crap.
Dems are all for Israel first and they have a wall and a military protecting its borders. Send them a massive bill for exploiting the USA military for their interests in the Middle East. USA does not benefit.
Dems are all for Israel they have a wall and military protecting its border. Expose the commie traitors.
Dems are the ones holding the government hostage. Build that wall and keep us safe.

Dennis Banaszak not even close to time for this yet.
Dennis Bottkol  I'm a troll? On the President of the United States of America.... Donald Trump website??? I think we know who's the Delusional Troll. You know just as well as anyone, it's nothing but a pissin contest between Pelosi and Trump....because Hillary Clinton ain't the President of the United States of America...  It's Donald Trump. Democrats don't want him fulfilling another campaign promise. They thought Hillary would win. It didn't happen.  But I betcha a wall gets built before the pissin contest ends. I although betcha you'll be back TROLLING The President of the United States of America.... Donald Trump... website again. Just sayin.... üòÅ  https://www.facebook.com/IJRRed/videos/2127951264121255/
Dennis Bottkol  Obama shut down the government.  Clinton shut the government down.  Reagan shut down the government.  The very first government shutdown didn't start in December of 2018 under Trump.  5 years ago ALL 54 Democrats in the house agreed to spend 40 billion dollars on border security. This shutdown is on Pelosi and Schumer.
Deport Melania since you hate immigrants
Deport your illegal alien wife, parents and birther son

Diana Elliott WHAT?
Diane Jachim Christensen grammatically incorrect statement... "couldn't care less" if they could care less that means they careüòè
Diane Ohize, That analogy of a wall that separated two countries, one free and the other over a communist dictatorship is typical of the kind of narrative the Democrats sell to the vulnerable and uneducated for many, many year's now!!If criminals from other countries were sneaking into a communist country seeking a better life you could use it however we know it's apple's and orange's so let's just "their you go again" do you remember Regan using that phrase everytime the Democrats would try and slip one through the goalie!!
Diane Ohlzen  BULLSHIT.
Diane Ohlzen Well "sweetie aka bitch" The Republicans didn't get it passed because our democrat disguised as a republican majority leader, Paul Ryan didn't do his job any better than Nancy.  They passed small amounts for the wall and thats because that was all Paul Ryan put on the floor to vote on.   As for the shut down, Trump can claim it but the fact is that it is Nancy's baby.  I can claim I anything, but it doesn't make it mine.  I'm hoping the shutdown lasts until approval for boarding funding AND THE WALL has been secured.  Democrats of today are idiots.                              CLOSE THE BOARDER AND BUILD THE WALL!                                             #MAGA
Diane Ohlzen You are entitled to your opinion as I am to mine. Shall we just agree to disagree?
Diane Ohlzen with every president. Don't you find it strange that Bush was for it, Clinton was for it, Obama was for it, Schumer was for it, Pelosi was for it. All were for it until Trump went into office. Hmmmm
Diaper nancy has her priorities and it certainly does not revolve around her job. Time to fire her. Build the wall! Trump 2020
Did Donnie's Kim Jung Un send a love letter to Big Don again?
Did Mexico pay yet? That was part of the promise right?
Did anyone else notice that the current government shutdown started under a Republican controlled government?   The current shutdown started Dec 22 (under the old congress) and the new congress started Jan 3.  Wtf on so many levels; but wtf?
Did i write Japanese?
Did you even read what I said???ü§îü§îü§î
Did you ever think why Democrats don‚Äôt want to build the wall, it‚Äôs not because they want to bring illegal immigration and help them , their personal agenda is to bring illegal immigration to get and keep the power in the White House they don‚Äôt really work for the American people they work for their own personal agenda.  if you want to see a difference don‚Äôt forget to support Donald J Trump on election time 2020
Did you make a pledge to parents of children slaughtered in schools by mass shooters?  Your priorities need to be realigned.
Did you notice the way Pelosi walks? Not in balance anymore.
Did you think it was mean spirited when PELOSI and others were jetting around having a big party on our dime in Puerto Rico? No you did not!! That's called a hypocrite! Sit down!
Didn‚Äôt trump have 2 years of republican house and senate. Still no wall money.
Didn‚Äôt you make promises to your wives, too?

Do it? Has to be fixed.
Do not back down on the wall.
Do not cave in President Trump! Start deporting DACA on a weekly basis until they are ready to negotiate! If you deport them all, then so be it! Democrats think they have to have their way or else and it‚Äôs time for a change in America!  Otherwise, America needs a Civil War!!!
Do not compromise. Wall or no reopen...
Do not give in,  finish showing their corruption and build the wall.  We are with you
Do not waiver in your position Mr. President. Stand Firm.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Do not want the wall if Trump is going to give away our country to get it.   Pelosi and Schumer are working for illegal immigrants, DACAs, and the citizens of foreign countries. Nothing is on that negotiating table but our  Taxpayers' dollars and a welcome mat for all future invaders and breakers of our laws  at our expense.  It is obvious that our immigration laws mean nothing to those coming over our borders or to those who came over illegally in the past. Pelosi's and  Schumer's demands are excessive since they are representing non-citizens.  What is next?  Another amnesty like the one in 1985  that will only encourage further breaking of our laws and actually encourage illegal immigration?   Even if negotiations end, the barriers will not be put in place.  We are being controlled by  the bullying and demands of non-citizens.
Do nothing DEMS will continue to do nothing. Declare National Emergency
Do some research on your own and see how much has been donated to those countries over the last 20 years...that hasnt changed anything..only thing that would do anything is to go in by force and remove their goverment in a all out war...until people in those countries stand up to their own goverment nothing will change.. 80% of the worlds population according to the UN lives on less than 10 dollars a day...is it sad yes but we cant support the whole world
Do the SOTU from a ballroom in the WH. Invite Angel Families to sit in the front with pictures of their loved ones. Television affords the opportunity to cut away and show graphics - charts, clips etc... use a pie chart to show how small that 5 billion is when compared to the budget. Show clips of illegals throwing rocks at Border Patrol. Show an empty seat for Pelosi and Shumer.
Do ur job Nancy
Do what the dems do, confront her in restaurants she goes to.
Do work on immigration and border security AFTER restarting the government.  This crippling Trump/McConnell Shutdown is causing more harm than the few illegals you claim are criminals and drug dealers.  Shame on you and all who think that any wall is worth this chaos caused by your selfish unwillingness to compromise!
Do you even know what a coup is?
Do you know how many AMERICAN BORN KILLERS ARE SITTING ON DEATH ROW EATING THREE MEALS A DAY GETTING MEDICAL ATTENTION.  You will not save this country with a wall period.  DONALD TRUMP "FOLLOWERS" OPEN YOUR EYES AND WIPE YOUR OWN ASS AND THINK FOR YOURSELF AND YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY AMERICANS ARE, ARE CURRENTLY, SUFFERING NOW OVER A WALL. THE HUMAN TRAFFIC SCANDAL IN ARIZONA ALLLLLLLLL AMERICAN BORN POLITICIANS!!! CRIMINALS COME IN ALL NATIONALITIES AND THE BIGGEST CRIMINAL OF ALL IS IN CHARGE OF THIS COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T CARE WHO HE STEPS ONNNNN!! NOT OVER ON!! This is a political statement.  This wall is the most ridiculous thing ever.  "Followers" who can't wipe their own ass and who are waiting on Donald Trump to tell them when to jump and how high voted for this terrorist because they can't think for themselves.  DONALD TRUMP is a TERRORIST: a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
Do you make this crap up? Pluck mystery numbers and so called facts from thin air? He's wank
Do you not realize that this happens with legal Americans as well? It is a flaw in our justice system not a flaw because it was an illegal immigrant. This is a judicial flaw not an immigration flaw. Fix the problem with our courts so that all repeat offenders and law breakers are stopped not just illegal immigrants.
Do you think that this is still The Apprentice?
Dodd Gross I agree with you..CNN are now a bunch of bullshits!!
Dodd Gross but who is being investigated? Not Obama and not Hillary. And your idiot president thinks there is a wall around San Antonio. It doesn't get any more stupid than that.

Don Cosner I would like to add today‚Äôs lesson: On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  ‚ÄúThere is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
Don Cosner The wall is a technically undefined, costly boondoggle for which no proper design work has occurred, based on a study by \the Government Accounability Office . https://www.engineering.com/BIM/ArticleID/17599/Writing-on-the-Wall-Report-Suggests-Border-Project-Is-Off-Track-and-Over-Budget.aspx?fbclid=IwAR18P243cIK1mcfW-ilc3oJlb3S4ulYq5GeY34DCbAzdcfKHK_HVOUGLpOA Please share with whomever you can
Don Januszewski the native american man put himself into that situation ALL BY HIMSELF. The kids WERE NOT bothering him at all. He ever n said it that HE instigated the whole situation. So thus just proves to me that HE IS A LIER AND A SHOULD BE TRUSTED. Also tge kid didn't block him and he was just standing there. My advice there is always 2 sides of the story.

Don't Give up Mr President ...I'm behind you 110%
Don't back down from these fake leaders who are only concerned with their wants and not the people. But please, do not punish our government workers who deserve to be paid. We need another way to get this accomplished. What are we saying to the people who work hard every day? That a wall is more important than they are? I want the wall. I will even vote for all Americans to pay a special tax to fund it. But Pelosi could care less about our people--her unwillingness to talk and negotiate proves this. Lock all of the Dems and Reps into a room and no one comes out until a decision is reached. No baths, no sleep, just negotiate. This is a national emergency--and it needs to be handled as such.
Don't back down! We stand in agreement with you! God bless you!
Don't back down!!! WE Stand with you Mr. President. Until the wall is built Do what no other has done. Activate the Militia and We will guard the border and safe guard this great Nation untill it is built. No money has to be spent. IF You ask I Know my self included Many would come forward and Volunteer for guard Detail. My Self like many vets took a Oath to Protect and Defend the Constitution of the United States against All Enemy foreign and domestic Sir. And we have never been re leaved of that Oath. WE stand ready to Serve again!! God Bless you Sir
Don't back down...build the wall and rebuild this broken system

WE, the Republicans and all your supporters, may seem like "few" because you dont hear much from us. We dont act stupid like the Democratic rioters, looters and cry babies. BUT, WE ARE "MANY"! We are as strong and as mean as they are, and we CAN and WILL get loud if need be. We want you to know that we strongly beside you, solid as a rock, through thick and thin. We see and understand all your efforts to make America great again. We continuously pray for you, your family and your presidency. We love you and appreciate you. We won't let let you down. Keep going strong! In Jesus' Name. IN GOD WE TRUST!!!
Donald J. Trump
Donald J. Trump LET THE PEOPLE TO VOTE ON THE WALL GAVE THEM CALL A TOLL FREE NUMBER USE THERE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TO VERIFY WHO THEY ARE AND ANSWER A SIMPLE QUESTION YES OR NO ON THE WALL THAT TAKES IT OUT  OF THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT ,,,LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE
Donald J. Trump knows there is no reason to worry about running again or being president if he cant do what he promised. Unlike the entire rest of Washington Trump is free of political fear. He either does what he promised and gets this or he realizes there's no point to being there. He wont back down. Why would he? Its Chuck, Nancy and the rest of congress who hope to be there 20 more years.  Stay strong.  Economy is good people can get 2nd jobs in private sector.
Donald J. Trump sir, we are an informed people, we find out things sir, can you expose this and deal with this as well ? this is preposterous and should not be happening to us. The left has created so much thieving of Americans its not acceptable. Thank You Donald J. Trump sir.   https://www.facebook.com/cory.wood.505/videos/2448828438465023/
Donald J. Trump, why would you be willing to make a deal to put 800,000+ useless government employees back on the payroll?  These folks and what they do are pointless.  If you really want to make significant changes start with eliminating all of these folks from government and end the income tax/stealing.
Donald J. Trump, you lying bullying con artist traitor+MF! You can fool your stupid sheep but not me.  Now, go seek asylum in Russia and get the f*ck out of our country.

Donald J. Trump‚ÄèÔÄ≤Verified accountÔÇô @realDonaldTrump   Don‚Äôt forget, we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly, and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building, after all, is what I do best, even when money is not readily available!........Of course it would cost less if you're not building a concrete wall from sea to sea....DUH.   Also, Contractors have replaced miles of dilapidated fencing with more modern alternatives, but they haven't built barriers anywhere they didn't exist already. When money isn't available you just don't pay the contractor, like you have done previously in your life.
Donald J.Trump  Get both sides of the  Lyme disease debate  in the same room . Our corrupt system is used to not talking about important issues facing the American people. Congressman Chris Smith is well aware of the issue. I have spent my life savings saving my wife‚Äôs life because our medical system is corrupt and broken !!!!! WE WROTE NANCY PELOSI TO MANY TIMES TO COUNT !!! NANCY WONT ADDRESS ANY ISSUE THATS CONTROVERSIAL !!! SHES BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY SPECIAL INTERESTS !!! SHES NOT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE !!!!!
Donald Trump The First, The Greatest, The King of Earth, Make The Universe Great Again please Sir !
Donald Trump declared today (Jan. 17) he was grounding Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs upcoming trip to visit troops in Afghanistan ‚Äúin light of the 800,000 Great American workers not receiving pay,‚Äù alluding to the expense of flying military aircraft there.  Hours later, his wife Melania Trump was on board a US military plane to Palm Beach, Florida, where the couple have a private club, on a flight that Quartz calculates cost US taxpayers $35,000.
Donald Trump is guilty of treason.
Donald Trump is the best President ever and the democrat communists are the worst criminals ever

Donald Trump" Wow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.
Donald Trump.  If you're going to use a handful of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants as your reason for a border wall, then you need to use the 340 mass shootings, the 666 children ages 0-11 killed or injured by guns, and the 2,830 teens, ages 12-17 killed or injured by guns, all of which impacted American families in 2018.   You have never, ever talked about the families who lost members to gun violence, but have been all too ready to mention a random killing done by an undocumented immigrant.  Americans are much more vulnerable to gun violence than violence from undocumented immigrants.  Your silence on gun violence is shameful and disrespects all families impacted!
Donald go hard ! Build the wall for the national emergency security .
Donald trump PLEASE GO BACK TO HELL WHERE YOU CAME FROM AND TAKE THESE RETARDED FOLLOWERS WITH YOU...
Donald, a thrice-married cheat, has a credibility problem. He asked for $1.6 billion, appropriations committee said "OK", then he said nevermind make it $5 billion, House said "OK", then he said actually $5.7 billion PLUS let's shutdown the government, and he struck no deals until the opposing party took the House away January 3. YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH LIARS.  So forget Donald, he is just fooling around. He's changed the terms before and he'll do it again, so just bypass him with a veto-proof majority.  Why? Because air traffic controllers. Because ICE. Because US Coast Guard. Because TSA. Because America is open for business, even if president bone spur isn't.  Veto-proof majority, just bypass the useless lying cheating bone spur.
Donald, just own the shut down like you promised and be quiet! YOU ARE A BIG FAILURE!
Donald, shove your wall up your arse!  Glenn
Donald, you are a Fascist, just like Mussolini.  Your tactics are those of a basic loser!  You receive no respect because you have earned no respect.  This includes respect from world leaders.

Each refugees costs tax payers $82k per year. Democrats vote harvest
Easy fix for all those in favor of making the term illegal immigration, sponsor a family into your homes no background check welcome them into your homes making it a legal immigration, so basically put your money where your mouthes are, with all the free stuff they get or drug money or human trafficking money they can pay you rent
Easy fix!  Start with military maneuvers and training on the southern border practicing for an invasion. Next sale all military bases in prime locations and move them to the southern border. That will put billions of dollars into building the wall and border security.  Because there‚Äôs no reason why  military bases or on prime American real estate

Ed Kramer How? White Racists now feel empowered to come out in public. WS certainly have free speech rights, but when was the last time you saw the swastika fly next to old glory? When was the last time you saw a US President support Russia invading another country??  This is the short list.

Elizabeth Burton Steere BEST PRESIDENT EVER!!!
Elizabeth Burton Steere Trust me. You are not the majority. You think you are. Try checking out the #walkaway movement. It has been growing fast and strong.
Elizabeth Burton Steere Vanity Wall ?How about u ask border agents what they think ??
Elizabeth Burton Steere have you not seen her stuttering etc?shes a fukn mess
Elizabeth Burton Steere smart people don‚Äôt fight against their own argument. She has stated multiple times that we need border security. She fights it now because she doesn‚Äôt want trump to be the one to do so. She is a hypocrite. She could give to shits about your safety and the safety of this country.
Elizabeth Burton Steere thoughts and prayers never was intended to be the solution. Thoughts and prayers are how people cope with tragedy. President Trump has proposed a wide range of security measures for our nation schools, but it's up to the individual School District to implement those measures including building walls around the campus.
Elizabeth it‚Äôs true she‚Äôs from California and she does care more about illegals then citizens.
Elizabeth take your meds
Elizabeth, I know that. That‚Äôs all you took away from that fact? Point is, IAs are costing American taxpayers billions of dollars annually (again, $22 billion in Cal alone each year) that should be spent on American citizens. So taxpayers are paying. Out the ass. And it needs to stop.
Ella Lafer-de-waal what on God's green earth has this Russian spy done for America? Oh right! A Yuuuge tax cut for his billionaire buddies and CEO friends..have you seen the deficit since he took office? You know 200 indictments ago...The U.S. Treasury reported that October‚Äôs deficit was $100 billion, an increase of $37 billion or 58% from a year ago. While one month may not be a trend, it puts the full-year deficit on a path from $779 billion in fiscal 2018 to $1 trillion in fiscal 2019. He's a business genius? lol suckers!

Erika Rhone I work in a union....so good luck
Erika Rhone it was not their money. Carter gave it back to them as ransom for the Americans Iran held hostage. He gave it back during the last hours of his administration.
Erika Rhone its astounding what they believe. How does a halfway smart person listen to Trump lie and change his story constantly and go, " Gee what a great leader!"  I guess when he told them not to believe what they read or hear...they listened.  Kellyanne said there were alternative facts- so they just go with those!! Lol
Erika Rhone thank u....they are threatening me ....calling my employerr....fbi....lol
Erika Rhone, if you've ever had a LEGAL job, guess what? You HAVE paid for the illegals and all of the benefits Barry O tried to increase for them!! #wakethefuckupdumbass
Erika, you're going to pay no matter what - Annual cost of illegal immigration: OVER $84 BILLION. Yet Democrats will NOT spend 5 BILLION to keep Americans safe & stop drugs. Wake up Taxpayers! #BuildTheWall üá∫üá∏
Erika:  I don't know WHERE you took such a poll as to arrive at:  "most hated president ever!!"...but, girl, are you ever so WRONG!!!  Must have been from the same source as the poll that had Killery winning the election!!  So, get out your coloring book, girl, 'cause we're putting THIS president back into office come 2020!!
Erin Curry Bayhan  You mean when Trump does the right thing. He shut the government down. By the way how many weeks have you gone without pay? The creditors don‚Äôt say oh pay us when you can. I can see why you support Trump & the Republican Party as you lack empathy & any understanding of what these 800,000 families are going through.
Erin Curry Bayhan he will get paid, but when I put gas in car, buy groceries, pay my mortgage, electric etc they aren‚Äôt going to take an IOU. Fortunately we have savings for now, but there are many couples that work at the prison and single parents who need their paycheck. I‚Äôm over both sides and the blame game, I just want this to all end. It is a sad day in our country for sure.
Errrrrrm how many Children do you think have died in American Bombing runs since 2002 Kathy? How many kids will die trying to get into America? Or are you just talking about Caucasian Children because your imaginary friend only cares about white babies right?

Every Business caught hiring illegals need 5 yrs imprisonment
Every country has borders, even ours.
Every president we have had for that past 40 years was going to fix our immigration problem but none of them ever did, they just gave it lip service and kicked the can down the road. Now we finally have a president that is actually trying to get the problem taken care of and everyone is having a cow. Keep up the fight President Trump, the people are behind you and want the immigration problem fixed and our border secured.
Every single thing below is verifiable.   This is why he is desperate to get the $5.6 billion:  From Donna Chaban-Delmas:  "This evening I would like to share something I just read, not my words, but those of someone who does his or her research before posting. What you will read here is a matter of public record.   This week we share with you a name....Roman Abramovich. (google him, we can wait....) Mr. Abramovich, a Russian national with Israeli citizenship, is an ally of Russian president Putin, and a personal friend of Donald Trump and his son in law. Mr. Abramovich is part owner (with several other Russian billionaires) of a steel company called Evraz - located in Canada - which, coincidentally, is the only one which can manufacture the specific type of metal beams Mr. Trump wants for his wall. (There was a Chinese company which could deliver the same product, but since Mr. Trump's trade war with China, they can no longer effectively provide it to the US.)  If the wall is built, Mr. Abramovich's company - in which Russian president Putin also happens to own stock through a complicated series of shell companies - stands to make roughly one billion US dollars during the first stage of construction alone. By the time the wall is completed, with costs estimated to run to almost 30 billion dollars (not 5 billion as the Republican parrots have been squawking), Evraz will likely triple in value.  This is of interest to Mr. Abramovich and his partners no doubt, since Evraz took a signifcant stock hit in early 2016, losing roughly 60% of its value....during the months leading up to the American Presidential Election.  Mr. Abramovich also owns a legendary yacht called the Eclipse, valued at roughly half a billion dollars.  Mr. Trump has been known to enjoy vacations on the yacht. One can safely assume the yacht has beautiful staterooms, with beds.  And showers.  And likely, given Mr. Abramovich's well-reported paranoia, there are plenty of security cameras in place....  Mr. Abramovich applied for Swiss residency some time ago, but was blocked by their government because of tangible evidence that he was involved in money laundering.  This is all public record. And it was presented to the media during the 2016 Election, when the press was slavering over Mrs. Clinton's emails and calling her "Killery".  But nobody listened."
Everyday I wake up hoping you died in your sleep. If only you would end this horrible nightmare and make America great again
Everyone needs to call their congressman and demand that she be removed as speaker of the house. This can be done by a majority vote. This woman is a clear threat to our nations security, and is unfit to serve. PLEASE CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN AND DEMAND THAT SHE BE REMOVED!!!!!
Everything goes up either way :D
Exactly the declaration I‚Äôd expect from you! No different than any other leftest so There‚Äôs no such thing as God, right? Exactly what we can expect from you & millions like you. God is still in control! How do you think you got your King? He‚Äôs your president so now down to him.
Exactly! Dems are all for Israel and Russia and they both have a military protecting their borders and Israel has a wall.
Exactly. If someone she cared about was killed by an illegal she‚Äôd fight like hell for those people. Well, maybe not even then because Trump supports them. She can‚Äôt very well support something that the man she thinks she will impeach supports.
Excellent points from Marianne. So sorry for your loss and many other losses due to the criminals that are coming over the Border. The Democrats have destroyed our freedom and our safety because of their selfishness and their lust for money. President Trump is fighting very hard to make things better and safer for us and expose the Democrats for who they really are.... Heartless Liars who just want their power and their money back. Our United States is not their personal piggy bank. We must be strong and safe and United the way we used to be. Many thanks to President Donald Trump! ‚ù§
Excellent!! Thank you ladies and thank you Mr. President!! The wall will be built,  stay strong and defeat this attempted coup by Pelosi and gang or America will be lost.
Except for the American people were forced to accept Obamacare which has become unaffordable and fined if they didn't obey. Thank god Trump took those fines away. The only ones holding this country hostage are the Democrats who refuse to negotiate out of hate. Get your facts straight.
Except the wall won't work.
Except you've turned down every safe border policy because it doesn't fund your ineffective wall.  Some your border security policies are great, but your wall will not stop significant amounts of drugs or illegals. Immigrants, and especially deportable immigrants, are our lowest violent crime and drug population.  I am with you, however, on making the lives of our border patrol agents easier. So are the democrats who have met every single one of your demands in compromise, even offering to give you some money for the wall.  I don't want to pay even a cent for it. You said "Mexico will pay for the wall". Keep that promise and you can have the colossal waste of resources you so desperately desire.  Meanwhile, reopen the government that you shut down Mr. President. Those families are actually suffering. They have actually had their job stolen. You said you would "proudly* do this. I am asking you, desperately, for families, for single men and women, for US children and elderly who depend on support networks to survive, for veterans, for those with significant medical conditions: please reopen the government. You are hurting these people. They are your people Mr. President.
Exclusiveness is a form of white arrogance !!!
Expel every single one who is here illegally. Let's start there!
Expose Commie Trudeau and his Saudi oil ties. A traitor to the Canadian and American people whom are family.
Expose Commie Trudeau too as he allows illegals and mass immigration to enter the country. He has Saudi oil ties-9/11 has to be reinvestigated a traitor to the founding peoples of Canada.
Expose Nancy's commie agenda and ties to Zionist Israeli nwo
Expose all hispanic communists and African brainwahsed Zionists and Israelites like Beyoncee and Whoopie. Africa existed before Israel and they cannot be either. NWO agenda to colonize African land using Africans.
Expose her Talmmudic laws for tribalism and Israeli first agenda.
Exterminate the Satan Evil axis Kim Jong Un. Never co-operate with the demons. I said this more than 1,000 times.
F#c@ Nancy. Build the wall
F*CK NANCY,BUILD THE WALL !!!!!!!!!
FACT: A WALL IS NOT SECURE: 1. Despite a wall, on Monday last week, 376 Central American immigrants dug their way under the wall and illegally entered Arizona. 2. DHS testing on wall prototypes showed the steel slats can easily be cut with an ordinary household saw. IT IS NOT SECURE. It is only a campaign promise.
FACT: Americans blame trump for shutdown , The house and the senate agreed on a deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!
FACT: Majority of Americans blame trump for shutdown, he even said it was him on TV, trump had majority of the house and senate, did nothing for 2 yrs., but give himself a huge tax cut, As soon as the Dems took the house, he called it an Emergency  ..lol  The house and the senate agreed on a budget  deal, ONLY TRUMP and   Mitch McConnell blocked it.. FACT!   Now he says hill give the same thing he took away, 2 yrs ago, DACA & TPS  offering temporary protection from deportations for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall funding for 5.7, for his NONE WALL he promised Mexico would pay for...lol ( not a compromise ) and makes up a crises, Majority of drugs come at ports of entry FACT!

Facebook must be dealt with severely. Facebook, cease to be a private organization when it became a monopoly, when it broke antitrust laws, and when it began from its Inception to promote a political leftist ideology, while discriminating against conservatives. Facebook has been a George Orwellian farm being used to program the minds of leftist people to their, FB's, Progressive agenda, Facebook's prevents should have an equal Level Playing ground for conservatives, as they are discriminate against daily.  Facebook has allowed its social media police 2 propagate and promote leftism oh, and radically Left ideologies. On the other hand, Facebook has discriminated against conservatives an often kick them off to silencer opinions, and intellectual voices. Facebook as any leftist fears the truth oh, and they don't want other people to hear the truth. Truth to the left and Facebook is like Kryptonite is to Superman

Faye Lemke Hamilton Mitch McConnell refuses to hold a vote. The Republicans held all of Congress for 2 years and somehow couldn't get this passed. Weird right??
Faye Lemke Hamilton oh my goodness we are well aware that the budgets come from the House of Representatives but some of us are actually aware that the house put forth several budgets voted past good to go however the house can't do that by themselves the holdup is now sitting firmly on McConnell shoulders there's no denying it stop trying
Faye Lemke Hamilton that‚Äôs because Cindy is Canadian.
Fear mongering.   Show us your taxes!
Feel sorry for the once  With out there checks  But we need the Wall To keep Our Country  Safe
Fight Facebook‚Äôs targeting and suspension of users who call out the left for hate speech against the President. Facebook allows trolls like Jere Gallimore to bully and harass with impunity. Post names of all trolls who bully and harass and report these trolls en masse.  Trump supporters on Facebook must organize like they do and fight back.
Fight Socialism!!! Fix the law. SAVE US!!!

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) at one point, according to two Republicans who attended the lunch and witnessed the exchange.  ‚ÄúAre you suggesting I‚Äôm enjoying this?‚Äù McConnell snapped back, according to the people who attended the lunch.  Johnson spokesman Ben Voelkel confirmed the confrontation. He said Johnson was expressing frustration with the day‚Äôs proceedings ‚Äî votes on dueling plans to reopen the government, both of which failed to advance.  The people who attended the lunch spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a closed-door session. Aides to McConnell, citing regular policy on GOP lunches, declined to comment on the gathering.  The argument was one of several heated moments in a lunch that came just before the Senate voted on the opposing plans to end the shutdown offered by President Trump and Democrats.  The outbursts highlighted the toll the shutdown has taken on Republican lawmakers, who are dealing with growing concerns from constituents and blame from Democrats, all while facing pressure from conservatives to stand with Trump in his demand for money to build a wall on the border with Mexico.  The votes the Senate cast on Thursday were the first on the shutdown since it began Dec. 22, with McConnell and other GOP lawmakers previously refusing to vote on anything this year unless it had Trump‚Äôs approval ‚Äî a policy that has drawn widespread criticism.  The day ended with some limited signs of progress. After the votes, McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) engaged in a face-to-face negotiation that senators hoped would lead to a solution in the near future.  The first proposal, which Trump put forward, would have allocated $5.7 billion for wall funding in exchange for temporary protections for some immigrants. Only one Democrat voted for it. Two Republicans rejected the plan.  Note for Bonus Points Discussion: More Repugnant Congresspersons voted for the Democratic Plan than the one advanced by Emperor Fullofshiticus.  Fact.

Four decades of old IMMIGRATION laws bad for 2019 update.
Four killed in Reno and Gardnerville, NV. Illegal alien arrested for the crime
Four more Angel Families‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî20 year old ILLEGAL ALIEN , Martinez Guzman, was just arrested in Carson City for the murder of 4 elderly Reno and Gardernerville Nevada residents last week. This POS is suspected of murdering a beloved 80 year old couple who were prominent members of our community. He also murdered two single elderly women.......each living alone. What kind of monster preys on the most vulnerable in our society? ANSWER: AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ONE. These murders are further proof that there is a real danger having unvetted illegals in our communities. Those who insist upon open orders and sanctuary cities ....appear to have more blood on their hands this week.    BUILD THE WALL NOW.....Before any more innocent lives are taken.
Francine, like Prison walls, they won't keep the criminals out :D great metaphor though ;)

Fred Leenhouts again showing your intelligence IC. Hum. Dutch.
Fred Leenhouts democrats only condone violence they themselves create to incite panic so they can continue to take away privileges that was never supposed to be able to be amended. I am of course referring to our Bill of rights that they have in fact effectively changed to a bill of privileges that they can take away at anytime without notice, cause, or due process of any kind.
Fred Leenhouts lolol have you read the mean and horrible things from the Republicans on these post? Talk about violent. It's all damn scary
Fred Leenhouts you to be nice‚ù§
Fred Trump, Sr. Congratulations. You raised a fine son in Donald Trump. You instilled in him hard work pays off. He is a very smart man. A kind and caring heart comes easy to him. He says what he thinks and doesn‚Äôt water it down. Just don‚Äôt cross him. He is brilliant in negotiating techniques and World leaders are learning he means business. The USA has never had a business man for our President before. It‚Äôs wonderful and we know he loves us and is working for us when we are sleeping. Our economy has grown and people who had been laid off are back to work. Businesses are caring for their employees and even giving bonuses. There‚Äôs some people who don‚Äôt like him because he is a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù kind of President and he is definitely ‚Äúin charge.‚Äù  He brings with him his beautiful and gracious wife First Lady Melania Trump. She is such an asset to him and the whole world loves her. Children are drawn to her and she is thriving. We have the best chance we have ever had to have a prosperous nation because he brings family that are loyal and talented is so many ways.  He is not liked by everyone because he does things his way, not the way it has been being done. You started him young and he accepted your training. We are a grateful nation and know you would be as proud of him as we are. Prayers daily for President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Second Lady Karen Pence. The Administration is successful even with all the resistance and obstruction from the opposing party. I applaud you for your success and we are blessed to reap the benefits.

These four souls were MURDERED this past week by a SERIAL KILLER who has been arrested in Carson City on an IMMIGRATION CHARGES and is named as the SUSPECT in their murders.  My town of Gardnerville and Reno is in anguish from the loss of these four wonderful, vital people who were purposely preyed on by this creature because they were senior citizens.  I thank God Almighty for our amazing men and women in law enforcement who worked unrelentingly to catch him before he could kill again.  These four beautiful people are dead. Children have lost their parents, brothers and sisters have lost their siblings, grandchildren have lost their beloved grandparents. Their legacies have been cut short.  Our entire community has been held hostage by this event. All of us have spent sleepless nights laying awake listening and afraid. All of us have gone to work unable to shake the mental images of our friends and neighbors last moments on earth. Our bank accounts have been lessened in our attempts to fortify our homes against a random killer. Our children's peace and innocent belief in humanity has been destroyed. This happened because MY country failed at protecting it's most precious resource. It's legal citizens. CHUCK and NANCY.... ARE YOU READING THIS???  YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. BUILD  OUR  WALL

Gary Farmer WHAT?
Gary Kane   A little chaos is good every now and then. Trump believes in getting things done. For years we have had a lot of talk and very little action. How can anyone say it‚Äôs trump‚Äôs fault when Pelosi won‚Äôt even meet and slams the door before even talking?  What I want to know is why Democrats don‚Äôt go around her and negotiate.
Gary Kane   I  Hope he shuts it down for a year.
Gary Kane   You crazy we need the wall to protect what few good people left in US not everyone is as crooked like people in Congress.
Gary Kane  NO. Each Refugee costs tax payers $82k per year. You pay tax payers are already overburdened by illegals needs
Gary Kane  Representatives, please put US citizen‚Äôs rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it‚Äôs more efficient, and they don‚Äôt throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities‚Äô computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S. Constituents, if you ‚Äòlike‚Äô this, like it whenever you see it.   https://m.facebook.com/The-Great-1461-Day-Adventure-360025854356893/

Gary O'Connor I am not republican
Gary Williams Wrong! True Americans love Donald Trump! Only the communist anti-americans and the ones who stare at their mailbox all day I have a problem with our President.
Gary Williams the Liberals have had freedom to think differently for too long and it's becoming the destruction of our country so now you're seeing conservatives fed up and taking control back
Gary go live in war torn and drug infested country and see how much better you have it there not to mention a FEAR of your safety and freedom, HUH ???
Gary so true I agree 100%. Also #ImpeachTheMF
Gary why would a wall hurt. Something needs to change so why not a wall. I can‚Äôt imagine you are ok with the drugs and child trafficking. The wall is not the only solution but a start.
Gary,you must not live by the boarder?Tell your Nancy to meet with President Trump,in stead of taking all her vacations.The shutdown is in Nancy hands.
Gary- why do you liberals speak with nothing factual to offer. Are you blind, or stupid? Probably both.  This falls solely on the democrats and the longer they continue, it ensures Trump's second term by a landslide.
Gary...are you for real.  Unbelievable.
Gated communities suck. Maybe with proper border control and national sovereignty, we won‚Äôt feel the need to have gated communities anymore. Build the wall !

Get over the wall Don
Get rid of Congress. We could only hope voters would see how useless they are.
Get rid of Pelosi she is a jerk
Getter done. Build the wall.
Getting more and more angry with this Party.  Where were you these last two years when you had ZERO RESISTENCE in building a wall, or reforming immigration you dick head.   You wait until you've got Pelosi and Schumer to blame for a wall you know you'll never actually build.  It's just too damn easy to whip up your base by dangling these bullshit posts and campaign speeches in front of them.   Put your money where your mouth is, because my Party sure the hell hasn't these last 2 years. Repeal and Replace!   Benghazi!  Fast and Furious!  Loretta Lynch on the tarmack!  Build the Wall!   Please.  All of the sudden, no one finds most of those important anymore, but they were ALL anyone could talk about when there was a Democrat to run against.  Hillary is gone, and so is all the talk about her crimes.   Put up or shut up Mr. President.  Same to this do-nothing GOP party I've spent the last 10 years fighting for/arguing/defending.

God bless our President. He certainly did not need to put himself and family through all of this but he works tirelessly for the good of our country. The Democrats and the leftwing media constantly bash him and lie and spread false stories.  The media does not report the GDP is way up or that wages are up... unemployment is low and record low for the black community. They run with every lie and then talk about it as an impeachable offense. You‚Äôre fed this day in and day out. Sick of the lies !  Can the Left see for them selves ? Wake up for goodness sake! I hope something happens that the left wing media is forced to admit truth and stop lying! What miserable people!

Good Morning Over There
Good Morning President Trump.
Good Morning, Mr. President!!
Good XOXO
Good afternoon from Montana. Stand strong President Trump. I support your efforts to keep America safe üá∫üá∏
Good but don't compromise and let the Democrats keep all those in who are already here.  Start w/ deporting all illegals who have committed rape, murder, theft.....  And stop the freebies!  If they don't get everything for free, you'll eliminate a lot of the illegal crossings.
Good hail to your queen
Good job President Trump
Good job, Mr. President!! Behind you 100 percent.
Good luck with that .
Good morning Mr President,  just saying we love you and your family and are praying for you
Good morning. Mr.  President. I pray that the  democrats will see that what we need is the wall not only to protect. America but to also protect the people who want to come here legally and have a better life..the ones who are fighting you on everything are selfish and greedy and have been in the government to long.they need to retire and stop being so nasty about everything..  God is watching and they will answer for it on judgement.day just like us all when we stand before. God..there is. Nothing in this world worth going.to. he'll for an eternity..to me they are evil and don't care about anyone but themselves... I thank. God for.you and your leadership ..  I just hope you don't give up on us. I will pray for.you.and our. Vice. President that. God.will give you strength to carry one. His will
Good speech yesterday. Most people found it to be common sense, although common sense isn't very common in democrats. I would put a timeline on it though and declare an emergency if they don't react. A lot of Feds are behind you, but we can't hang on forever. Build that wall!
Good stand firm to pull down the strong holds
Good thing our front line border agents aren‚Äôt as dumb as you.
Good to hear that you‚Äôve given up on the useless wall idea and decided to focus on something that will actually work
Good..
Got to love Trump
Gotta love ma Mendoza!!!
Government is a mess..
Great President Illegal is Wrong..
Great eye-opening interview.
Great idea!....now, how about listening to the experts as to how you do that(?)
Great job!!
Great leader....God bless you Sir.
Great post from Christina Henderson, the colleague of a friend who works in Congress:  A year ago, Trump was offered by Dems $25 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA TWICE! Let me repeat this part ‚Äî $25 billion for the wall today, in exchange for a 10- to 14-year path to citizenship for 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were young. And twice Trump agreed to it before turning it down 24 hours later (thanks Stephen Miller and John Kelly).  The THIRD time he could‚Äôve had a deal, a group of bipartisan Senators came up with another offer which could win the support of 60 Senators. A path to citizenship for DACA recipients, $25 billion for border security, and it prevented DACA recipients from sponsoring their parents for legal status. Trump was on board in theory to let the ‚ÄúKing of the Hill‚Äù plan play out (4 immigration bills on the floor and let the best man win), but the morning before the vote, Trump threatened to veto this bipartisan bill. As a result, it failed 54-45. The night before, there were 60. The Trump favored bill, which gutted legal immigration to the US and provided $25 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA, only got 39 votes that same day, to be clear. The lowest number of votes of the 4 immigration bills voted on that day.  Months ago the Senate approps Committee passed a bipartisan $1.6 billion for border security‚Äîno new barriers could be constructed. That‚Äôs what DHS asked for in the appropriations process. And in the 11th hour, Trump said that wasn‚Äôt good enough.  Sooooo this idea that some how Democrats are being unreasonable here is laughable. Every time they think they have a deal he changes his mind on the terms. Staff meets but everyone knows no one but him at the WH is authorized to agree to anything. It is like negotiating with Jell-O. And he has already said he is not willing this time to trade for anything ‚Äî DACA, TPS, etc. He wants $5 billion, no strings attached. And when your friends ask, why Democrats won‚Äôt agree to that after being willing to give him $25 billion a year ago ‚Äî say these three words: elections have consequences. The makeup of the House and Senate has shifted and so have the votes.  Trump could‚Äôve had his wall, but he‚Äôs not a good negotiator‚Äîhe walked away from the best deal he could‚Äôve had a year ago. Who knows what he‚Äôll say at 3pm today, but at this point it looks like the national emergency is the only way he can save face. Because when he says I‚Äôm waiting on Nancy to call me to make a deal, what he really means is I‚Äôm waiting on Nancy to come and give me exactly what I want. That may have happened with Paul Ryan, but it‚Äôs a new day. And let‚Äôs be real, there aren‚Äôt even enough moderate, red state Senate Dems left to reach 60 while a third of the caucus seems to be flirting with a run for President.  {fin. leaves soapbox.}‚Äù- Christina Henderson

HELL.YES
HELLO!!!!!   I never believed in Love Spells or Magics until now: When I eventually found testimonials about this spell caster baba iyamu , and how he has helped many people to get their lovers and broken homes back, i immediately contacted him through his email address: ( dr.iyamusolution@gmail. com ) because I was absolutely desperate to get my husband back. Life without my husband was a real mess for me and my child. i wanted a dramatic change and I thought magic could be the solution. After discussing the resolution with baba iyamu , he gave me hope that he will restore my marriage. I felt confident that he will actually make my husband to return home and he did! It's fantastic what this great spell caster have done for me, his help is priceless! I don't know what I would have done without baba iyamu, he does his job so well, he is organized and highly functional, i believe he is the best spell caster i can count on when it comes to all kinds of spells, his spell worked very well and fast. If you need help, contact him too, you can also reach him on Whatsapp  +380662904762
HEY NANCY!!!!   Wake up!!!
HILLARY LOST IS THE DEMOCRAPS PROBLEM. Running scared with all the skeletons in their closets !
HOW MANY AMERICAN SONS WERE KILLED BY TIMOTHY McVEIGH? THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER? THE SHERMAN OAKS SHOOTER?? SANDY HOOK?? LITTLE CHILDREN?? BY WHITE AMERICAN MALES!!??? TRUMP DOESN‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT AMERICAN PEOPLE - HE ONLY CARES CARES ABOUT AMERICAN DOLLARS!!
Ha ha ha ha you must be from the south or mid west all his clowns are there ha ha ha you crack me up
Haha Lara too much botox!
Haha most who supports the wall seem to be in late 50-60s with no actual understanding of how it works.
Hahah look at these inbreds still insulting away. And judging by the time, you should all be asleep or working night shift?. Clearly the Trailer Trash element has arrived :D
Hahaha I love Republicans insulting intelligence :D I'd say its irony but they aren't smart enough to understand it let alone use it :D
Hahaha is that seriously the best you have? A few insults from Brainwashed idiots who think Moron Don actually cares about them? *Yaaaaaaawn* And as for blasphemy? Who cares what Christians who want to stop people seeking shelter think? If Jesus came back you'd label him a Leftie Commie Democrat anyway :') Come stalk my page, tell me I'm not pretty :p You utter morons...
Hahaha triggered more Republicans :D Today has been a great success :D
Hang in there Mr President! Keep up the great work. We know you love America!
Hang in there Mr. President. We're with you. At some point you might tell the people who aren't getting paid that it may be in their best interests to take advantage of our awesome economy to find a job in the private sector. Keep the gov't shut down, privatize those agencies that are necessary and let the departments and agencies that are proving to not be essential go away.
Hang tough Mr.President. we need the wall.
Happy 2nd anniversary Pres Trump for being our President - inauguration day!   Have a very nice day!!‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüá∫üá∏
Happy two years in office! Thanks for all you do for America!
Harold Kupers, it's not all about me it's what he is doing for this country, besides what he has done for me!! This country has a booming economy and when I ran a corporation in NYC I always said we needed a businessman to remove all the crippling regulations and high taxes to allow businesses to grow and hire more people,  he is bringing respect back to our military and police officers who sacrifice their lives to provide our security!! Our Country is a safer and more economically capable of bringing the American dream to all those who seek it legally!!
Harold Meinster  I'll bet you get trolled a lot. Its what you get when you post bullshit from a fucking cowardly, lying, draft dodger with Putins hand up his ass.
Harold Meinster  Trump pulled those caravans out of his ass, sucker.
Harold Meinster, is that true or did Trump tell you that?
Harry Leon Hann you must be on drugs.  SMH
Harry May...If my family needs to be haunted, all they have to do is look at your Facebook picture. That will do the trick :)
Has he said a word about those kids who heckled the Vietnam vet?
Have ALL you whinging Remoaners read the Lisbon Treaty, if you haven‚Äôt, here‚Äôs a taster for you!  WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE LISBON TREATY, THE TREATY THAT COMES INTO FORCE 2020, ITS WORSE THAN THE SO CALLE DEAL, IF 99% OF THE BRITISH THINK THIS THE DEAL IS BAD JUST LOOK AT THE LISBON TREATY. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW, LEAVERS AND REMAIMERS..‚ÄúWhat will actually happen if we stay in the EU‚Äù is a question no remainer will ever answer but here it is warts and all.  1: The UK along with all existing members of the EU lose their abstention veto in 2020 as laid down in the Lisbon Treaty when the system changes to that of majority acceptance with no abstentions or veto‚Äôs being allowed. 2: All member nations will become states of the new federal nation of the EU by 2022 as clearly laid out in the Lisbon treaty with no exceptions or veto‚Äôs. 3: All member states must adopt the Euro by 2022 and any new member state must do so within 2 years of joining the EU as laid down in the Lisbon treaty. 4: The London stock exchange will move to Frankfurt in 2020 and be integrated into the EU stock exchange resulting in a loss of 200,000 plus jobs in the UK because of the relocation. (This has already been pre-agreed and is only on a holding pattern due to the Brexit negotiations, which if Brexit does happen, the move is fully cancelled - but if not and the UK remains a member it‚Äôs full steam ahead for the move.) 5: The EU Parliament and ECJ become supreme over all legislative bodies of the UK. 6: The UK will adopt 100% of whatever the EU Parliament and ECJ lays down without any means of abstention or veto, negating the need for the UK to have the Lords or even the Commons as we know it today. 7: The UK will NOT be able to make its own trade deals. 8: The UK will NOT be able to set its own trade tariffs. 9 The UK will NOT be able to set its own trade quotas. 10: The UK loses control of its fishing rights 11: The UK loses control of its oil and gas rights 12: The UK loses control of its borders and enters the Schengen region by 2022 - as clearly laid down in the Lisbon treaty 13: The UK loses control of its planning legislation 14: The UK loses control of its armed forces including its nuclear deterrent 15: The UK loses full control of its taxation policy 16: The UK loses the ability to create its own laws and to implement them 17: The UK loses its standing in the Commonwealths 18: The UK loses control of any provinces or affiliated nations e.g.: Falklands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar etc 19: The UK loses control of its judicial system 20: The UK loses control of its international policy 21: The UK loses full control of its national policy 22: The UK loses its right to call itself a nation in its own right. 23: The UK loses control of its space exploration program 24: The UK loses control of its Aviation and Sea lane jurisdiction  25: The UK loses its rebate in 2020 as laid down in the Lisbon treaty 26: The UK‚Äôs contribution to the EU is set to increase by an average of 1.2bn pa and by 2.3bn pa by 2020 This is the future that the youths of today think we stole from them?  They should be on their knees thanking us for saving them from being turned into Orwellian automatons, if we escape from control of the EU.
Have Nancy and Chuck met with any of these victims to console them?
Have to start at the border
Have you ever been to texas or the border? I doubt it..why dont you come down and spend a week in el paso...

Having a hard time understanding how our politicians have decided to become the representatives of illegals. Got all the time in world for some illegals and none for Americans. Hand out our money to people who materialize out of thin air practically. Stop pussyfooting around and build it. The progressives in both parties are never going to consent even tho they know it‚Äôs what we need. Time to see how much cartel money is in Congress and senate.
Hazel Ramey how's that working out for you? ü§£Republicans investigated Hillary for 4 years and $250 million and came up with nothing. Comey and Rosenstein are Trump appointees just like Cohen (guilty on 8 felony counts) and Manfort (guilty on 8 felony counts). Steele is a former MI6 agent, (British intelligence for you ignorant Trumpanzees). Clinton was already impeached for lying to congress as he should have been. So when does Trump get impeached for lying to congress and everybody else on a daily basis?
He did all he could to roll back regulations that protect companies from polluting and screwing up the environment. I guess that's how he is creating jobs.
He did delete it scared are ya
He did shut it down for 16 days William.
He has a PO box, Janice
He is Steve King's man
He is doing great! Keep it up!
He is never getting his own way on this so its a moot point :D You can rant and wave your #MAGA banners all you like :D he's gone next year :D
He is not just ignorant--which could be the case for a smart person or one of average intelligence who was just too lazy to learn.  He is not just allergic to facts because they tend to undermine his worldview and reveal his cons and his crimes. He is actually a full-fledged nitwit who is as unfamiliar with logic, sound reasoning, true insight, a sense of consequences, the relevance of context, as he is with ethics, or values or taste.  Yes, he is a traitor and a criminal and a vile hateful person. But we must always remember that which he reminds of every time he opens his mouth or Tweets his Tweets.  He is dope, a maroon, a useful idiot to some and a dangerous idiot when it comes to all the rest of us.  He is a dim bulb who has left us all stumbling around in is darkness. Time to flip on the lights America and see this guy for who he is and for what he is not.  Later we can determine the role dementia or drugs or lack of education or arrogance or just bad genes played in the creation of this pinheaded ninny of a cretinous nincompoop. But for now, as you weigh our circumstances and likely outcomes, always remember, it is not just bad character or greed or evil at work here...though they too are all present.  It is that our president is also just plain dumb.
He is trying. Look what he is up against. One man against our nation for we the people and the people complaining about being inconvenienced because school lunch might be affected. Send your kids lunch!
He isn't your president, STHU you irrelevant foreign troll!
He just offered a compromise that was rejected by Pelosi. He has tried.
He knows what is coming, and has sounded his trumpet. Now, free-will and choice. That is the balance. God bless you, President Trump! <3 Amen
He loves PR trumpy
He may be in a pickle?  face impeachment, or resign and face conviction! ??
He want to make everybody live without fear is a peace keeping  leader.
He was beautiful.  As was my son.   They are both in heaven.  I promise you that.
He will lead us through the fires of the afterscape. AMEN MAGA üçû
He will soon be a footnote in history. Americas Worst Dictator
He's a joke outside the Red States as well.
He's not a President :D He's a temper tantrum with a modicum of power :')
He's not working for free. He'll be getting his pay when Nancy and Chuck do the right thing.
He's tweeting the 11 million number from 20 years ago this morning. Ann Coulter is right.
He. Doesn‚Äôt. Care.--Not one word in President Trump's speech to or about the 800,000 affected federal workers, who are increasingly feeling the pain of this shutdown as it stretches into its fifth week
Hei Man dont atacc to Venezuela OK dont ataac this os very dangeuos
Heil Donald J. Trump!  i have never been so embarrassed for my country than now.  Drop the hatred and quit hiding behind a symbolic wall.
Hell no we don‚Äôt want something we don‚Äôt need! What we want is a president ...
Hell of a lot more good old fashion Americans doing everything you rant about.
Hello Sunday!  Take the time today and reflect back on the Ten Commandments and the Commandments not being followed by those who pressed their hand on the bible when sworn in to office.  Nancy read and reflect the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th.  Then I,m sure you will have No Problem meeting with the Angel Moms and the President.  In keeping with the 3rd. Call upon The Lord to give your soul guidance not your Party today.  Praying for Everyone today that this effects!  Praying for our Nation today!
Hello Victoria, funny thing, in the bible we learn that the Jewish people are a chosen people by God for God, and us Gentiles are actually favored in some ways the Jewish people struggle to see, in any event, in these end times we gentiles, look to the Jewish nation for signs of the times, the End times, preparing to be with our Lord in the air,  Great book, Wonderful God! ;-)

Here is some factual reading     Daniel James Holloway January 8 at 8:46 AM A conservative challenged liberal Facebook friends to ‚Äúmake a case, not based on emotion‚Äù against Trump‚Äôs wall. Conservative buddies flooded his post with snide remarks about how this would be impossible for ‚Äúdeluded libs.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll play,‚Äù I responded. And in order to avoid being accused of bias, I explained that I would use only conservative sources to prove my point. My primary source was a policy paper by the Cato Institute, a conservative, rightwing think tank, along with other conservative voices (listed at the end of the piece). Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm against the wall, I wrote:  1. Walls don‚Äôt work. Illegal immigrants have tunneled underneath and/or erected ramps up and down walls to simply drive over them. People find a way. When East Germany erected its wall, it created a military zone, staffed by booted, machine-gun carrying guards ready to shoot to kill. Yet thousands managed to make it to West Germany anyway. More to the point, do we really want to model ourselves after communist East Germany?  2. Most illegal immigrants are ‚Äúoverstayers.‚Äù They come to the US legally ‚Äî for vacations, business, to study, etc. ‚Äî and then STAY past their visas. By 2012, overstayers accounted for 58% (THE MAJORITY!) of all unauthorized immigrants. A wall is meaningless here!  3. Walls have little impact on drugs being brought in to the US. According to the DEA, almost all drugs come in through legal points of entry, hidden in secret containers and/or among legit goods in tractor-trailers. A wall will have little to no impact on the influx of drugs into our country.  4. It‚Äôs environmentally impractical. Walls have a hard time making it through extreme weather. For example, in 2011, a flood in Arizona washed away 40 feet of STEEL fencing. Torrential rains and raging waters do serious damage. Also, conservative sources generally do not address the environmental harm that walls create, but there is plenty of documentation available that show its potential for irreparable damage to both plant and animal life.  5. A wall would forces the U.S. government to take land from private citizens in eminent domain battles. Private citizens own much of the land slated for the wall. The costs of the government snatching private land ‚Äî and the legal battles that would ensue ‚Äî are incalculable.  6. Border patrol agents don‚Äôt like concrete or steel walls because they block surveillance capabilities. In other words, they can‚Äôt mobilize correctly to meet challenges. So in many ways, a wall makes their job more difficult.  7. Border patrol agents say, ‚ÄúWalls are meaningless without agents and technology to back them up.‚Äù Are we prepared to pour countless billions annually ‚Äî after the wall is built ‚Äî to create a nearly 2,000 mile, militarized 24-hour surveillance border operation? Because according to patrol agents, that‚Äôs the only way a wall would work. Again, are we really, going to use East Germany, a brutal communist state, as our model here?  8. Where walls have been built, there was ‚Äúno discernable impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens.‚Äù In other words, they came in elsewhere, primarily where natural barriers such as water or mountainous regions precluded a wall.  9. An unintended consequence is that a wall blocks farmworkers from EXITING when their invaluable seasonal work is done. Farmers are against the wall because it makes getting cheap seasonal labor almost impossible as few American citizens want or can even do those jobs. And if seasonal worker do get in, a wall makes it harder for them to leave! A wall traps migrant farm laborers in our country.  10. Trump‚Äôs $5 billion is a laughable drop in the bucket for what would ACTUALLY be needed. For example, according to the Cato Institute: An estimate for a border wall area that only covered 700 miles was originally 1.2 billion. How much did it REALLY cost? SEVEN BILLION. And that‚Äôs only for 700 miles. Whatever we think it‚Äôs going to cost, experience shows us we have to multiply it by more than 500%.  11. According to MIT engineers, the wall would cost $31.2 billion. Homeland Security estimates it at $22 billion. Given the pattern of spending mentioned in number 10 (plus Murphy‚Äôs Law), that means we‚Äôre really talking about pouring endless billions into something that doesn‚Äôt even work. And, of course, we taxpayers will be footing the bill, not Mexico. Given all the drawbacks, is that REALLY the best use of our taxes?  As the conservatives of the Cato Institute put it, ‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs wall would be a mammoth expenditure that would have little impact on illegal immigration.‚Äù (Emphasis mine) Also it would create many ‚Äúdirect harms:‚Äù ‚Äúthe spending, the taxes, the eminent domain abuse, and the decrease in immigrant‚Äôs freedoms of movement.‚Äù  And, we must add, since conservative sources do not ‚Äî that the environmental harms are likely to be severe.  In other words, the facts show that walls don‚Äôt work and they create even bigger, more expensive problems.  So what happened after I posted this conservative-sourced, fact-based list of why the wall is a bad idea?  Silence.  I waited for someone to respond, to engage with me. Where were the angry defenses or rebuttals? But when I searched for the post after a few days, I couldn‚Äôt find it.  My FB friend had deleted it. You could say, like Trump with the government, he shut me down rather than deal with the facts.  The ugly genius of Trump is his ability to manipulate deep, primal emotions ‚Äî namely fear and hate. He, along with Fox News, have convinced his base that they are in ‚Äúextreme danger‚Äù from immigrants and only a wall will make them ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù  Unfortunately, the need to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù safe is much stronger than the will to grapple with a complex, multi-faceted problem.  And so, here we are, paralyzed by shutdowns at every turn.

Here's an idea dumb dumb, crack down hard on those who employ undocumented immigrants, shut them down and send them to jail. Once the word gets out no one here will hire them they will stop coming and the 100's of thousands that fail to honor their visa commitments will leave. But then we will have to convince all your trumpkins to go to work
Here's what I wish the Democrats would say to Trump: Mr. President you can have your wall. You can get it the same way that President Obama got Obamacare; the way Lyndon Johnson got Medicare; the way Franklin Roosevelt got Social Security. In each case the president had a project he wanted enacted; so his administration crafted a bill. That bill went to Congress where committee hearings were held; amendments were proposed; studies were conducted that tested the cost, effectiveness etc. of the proposal; testimony was held in Congress; debate ensued and if the measure had enough support, a vote was taken and the measure was passed. That's how you legislate. It takes hard work, planning and the ability to actually negotiate. Your pet project doesn't get to leap frog over the pathway laid out by the Constitution and 250 years of precedent. You have chosen to skip over this entire process (even when you had majorities in both Houses) and have resorted instead to taking the American public hostage in exchange for your wall. You want a wall? Put down the gun you are holding to the head of the American people and get to work.
Hes not able to make with the wall because the people who have ssi wont able to make it they cant give any more money. Hey wont able to try to raise they. Rent on i wouldn't pray for that because think of. It think your family's that will be at risk of mistaken that some of us may look like immmargits you have to find away to not have you're familys will be at risk its a biggest mistake ever in his life and you guess keep blessings him with that wall you will put your family at risk im telling you
Hey Max: Stay in Italy asshole
Hey Nancy I am a taxpayer and I want the wall. Got it!!!!!

Hey Orange üçä do you really think I‚Äôm stupid enough to accept your cat fishing friend requests from gorgeous women with fake profiles?  You‚Äôre dumber than I thought.  You don‚Äôt have to work for the NSA to know how to type the word netstat into cmd line
Hey Pilosi support.....
Hey bitch we want the wall
Hey gullibles... border crossings are at a 46 year low... stop listening to this liar.
Hey here's an idea to pay for your damn border wall. How about you decriminalize marijuana and use the profits to fund the building. Instead of fucking over the American people with this shutdown
Hey idiot.....most that live on the border don't see a crisis.  You can dig under a wall or fly over it.  Most drugs come in through checkpoints.  Most illegals don't come from Mexico.  You are the dumbest and most evil president ever.  You and your family need to go to Russian where you belong since you are all Russian Agent Traitors.  Most hated presdient ever.  There - you are the greatest at something.  Being Hated.
Hey nancy u dumb cunt BUILD THE WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hey, Obama picked up a catastrophe from the last GOP pres. Reagan was a butcher in Central America, He didnt answer for iran Contra and Emptied Social Security... all great CHRISTIANS. Trump is born again Jun 2016, won the nomination Jul 2016 and is the prophet foretold in Daniel chapter 8.  Can the GOP get any more devious.. oh wait..it certainly will.
Hey, didnt know Trayvon Martin neither, but his black life mattered to me also.
Hi
Hi Horseface, Laura Trump
High approval rating. Just writing that makes everything that follows crumble.
Hillary's going to prison soon, Obama next. My guess is Obama will be more than happy to pick up the soap.
Hispanic communists brainwashed by Israel
Hit that false news button folks üëçüèΩ
Hmm... there are so many MORE Angel Families whose loved ones have been murdered by citizens ... but I guess they do not count, because they are not part of YOUR agenda. Sickening. :(
Hoe can people call him  the greatest president  .with a month long shut down and all the other bull crap going on. ....
Hold Strong üí™ to that commitment!
Hold Your Ground, Mr President Donald J. Trump. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Hold the Line Mr. President! FOR American citizens and Legal Immigrants wanting to become American Citizens!
Hold this L
Holding American Citizens HOSTAGE is NOT the American Way. Trump needs to end the Humanitarian Crisis HE CREATED in This Country and OPEN the Government NOW!
Hoodwinked. No one wants open borders
Hoosen Moosa If we stop supporting them, they do pay for it...
Hoosen Moosa The New NAFA agreement will indirectly pay for the wall. Pay Attention
Hopefully sane Americans see that Democrats are playing politics with our security.  Will the wall stop 100% of illegals? No it won't but it will stop a lot and it costs so little that it should be a no brainer.
Hoppy Hopkins "I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it." ~ Donald Trump
Hoppy Hopkins trump needs no help laying a trap....he creates them
Horse face is speaking
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is a coward & a con.
How about  families who LOVED ones were killed by WHITE AMERICAN  mass shooter,  drug addict looking for a fix, young husband working at a gas station to feed his family , drunk driver    they don't count ,I don't see  TRUMP PROMISING them any thing
How about firing Nancy she knows everybody wants the wall the government needs to reopen up
How about if we give in to the Left and say that all the immigrants can come to America but they have to live in California or a designated sanctuary city and they will receive no federal money.  They will have to be supported by the state and city where they live.   Let the left deal with the chaos afterward, then they can't blame the President, because it's what the big babies are crying for.  Just a thought from a person who is tired of all the fighting.
How about parents of the children killed at Parkland? Or any of the other mass shootings?   Illegal immigration is at an all time low. Mass school shootings at an all time high. Kids have to grow up practicing active shooter drills. Any Republican that pretends that the wall is for the safety of kids, but in the same time does nothing for the safety of children gunned down in mass shootings is nothing more but a hypocrite.
How about safety in schools‚Äîoh yeah you said you would send prayers.
How about simply enforcing our already very generous immigration & naturalization laws?   -  https://www.amazon.com/Patriots-America-Thigngs-American-Should/dp/1596525495/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1517173322&sr=8-1&keywords=america+a+z+moser
How about that promise to fix out broken healthcare system?
How about the AMERICANS you put out of work! You want them to do a job for FREE! If it was me I'd walk in and be like your a fucking joke and a pos. You'd take it like the bitch you are
How about the mothers and wives of those killed by gun violence in the USA? 14,400 Americans gunned down in 2018? Are they angel mothers too? Any death is horrific. But: to exploit these women as a bargaining chip shows how little morals you people have
How about we also fix our foster system as children are sill being put into abusive homes
How about we increase ‚Äúforeign aid‚Äù to Mexico and have them build it on their side???
How about you tell MEXICO you want the wall.
How about ‚Äúbillionaire‚Äù Trump kicking in about $50 million for his wall.  Put your money where your mouth is, cheapskate!
How are things in Lagos, Why are you posting here???  Troll !!!
How can this be https://www.facebook.com/100000136717741/posts/2448829751798225/
How can you fix the broken immigration system, by compromising with the likes of Nancy Pelosi? You've already given in too much, by trying to get her to allow you to build the necessary wall. Declare an emergency, and bring the military in to build the wall. The people coming in, are invaders and should be treated as such.
How do we in America have politicians that are anti-America, ad refuse to protect our citizens from illegals crossing our borders ad allowing them to take what we worked for and make it theirs, assaulting, raping, murdering innocent Americans by protecting the illegals and demanding OPEN BORDERS?  This is just a deliberate act by those Democracks, to flood America with foreigners and giving them the right to vote for them without being citizens.  This is an atrocity to Americans, and abomination to our country ad the lives of our AMERICAN CITIZENS.
How do we tell Nancy and Shurmer we want them to resign I think that should be a petition all Americans should be able to sign also because every where I go it's all I hear people saying they.  Want these two idiots out
How do we tell you to get lost look at our country and the people who can‚Äôt afford to feed their children and pay their mortgage but yet that‚Äôs ok according to the Democratic Party because it was one of them that ordered that into law fuckin Obama care nothing the Democratic Party has done has benefited the American people why didn‚Äôt they impeach Clinton because oh I forgot he was a democrat but yet they want to impeach trump last time I checked he hadn‚Äôt shooved a cigar up any young interns vagina and said he didnt do it when he did like Clinton the Democratic Party has embarrrassed this country to the fullest and no one likes any of them. And they need to go al they do is rob and steal the American people blind
How do you control China‚Äôs illegal immigrants?
How do you know, have you tried it?
How does Oleg Deripaska own you? https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/oleg-deripaska-russian-sanctions.html?action=click&module=Top+Stories&pgtype=Homepage
How does Pelosi and Schumer run this country? Do all the dems have no back bones? They wanted a wall until Trump was Prez. They wanted DACA and STP and now Trump has offered all 3 and now they dont want it. Ive seen kids do that, they throw a tantrum and finally you give in and then they say no I dont want it. Dont get it
How does a wall slow down a Criminal Cartel with Planes exactly?
How in the Hell, do these illegals keep breaking the law & are still here? Oh, I got it!! It's the FKen DemoCraps doing!!!!!
How long do we have to wait on the Democrats ? Psychos are not rational people.
How long is this wall and where will it be? The VP says 234 miles. Is this true? Maybe if the president were more specific and consistent, the congress would commit our money. The founding fathers were so wise to plan a system of checks and balances, especially now that we have a petulant president with a history of bankruptcies and lawsuits.
How many decades have we not had a wall .. why now d idiots this is a country with many races  .. what's a wall ha going to do ..dumb a'ses. .
How many families of those who lost loved ones in mass shootings committed by fellow citizens have you contacted? How many of them have been used in campaign ads?  Can they be angel moms, too?
How many people do you think Pelosi will allow on her property, we see set-ins when things are not right and I believe it is time the American people take the problem to Pelosi home and see how she wants to protect it.
How many people have been killed by white males in our country?????
How many people have to tell you that your ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù vanity project won‚Äôt work? We need people and technology to monitor the border, not a wall.
How many punches can a man take
How many times did he say, ‚ÄúMEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL.‚Äù  He said it in every speech. And when anyone asked him HOW that was going to happen he (not surprisingly) didn‚Äôt have an answer.   Not only is he a liar but he is an in your face liar bcz he knows he will get away with it. He will tell you anything and you will believe it.  Now thousands of Americans aren‚Äôt getting paid, our country is in shambles, and MEXICO is never going to pay for that wall.  Pathetic.
How many trillions have been spent on wars, and now socialists want to open the boarders and invite the war here. My small community was pummelled with rapists and murderers because LEGAL immigrants came from WAR TORN COUNTRIES and bring the hate and violence with them. WHO SCREENED THESE PEOPLE?!?!
How much did you pay those media to not bash you ?
How much does each republican claim for expenses? Just asking?
How much does it cost tax payers for just one year to support the illegals we have now?
How much longer are we going to play this game ?  You can end the shutdown and have a wall with a stroke of a pen... What are you waiting for ?
How the hell is Pelosi still in her position? Total incomprehensible!   Who does she represent in this REPUBLIC?
How true.  But with the exception of the Legislation.  The rest of it is happening.  Its just a post to help people see a broader picture.
Human field education are border walls in orders to action in the sequences of time. Civil communities are border walls for a safer planet in the mass crowd environments and the networking life in it. Whats migrating? Can it be caught? Are UFOs real?
Hurry up & resign.
I <3 My President ! Thank you for fighting for the AMERICAN people! #BUILDTHEWALL
I SIGNED the petition.  But honestly, she does NOT care!
I THINK SO! WHO ARE THE OTHER 52 REPUBLICANS BESIDES SENATOR GRAHAM INVOLVED WITH PUTIN, TRUMP AND CHRISTIAN EXTREMISTS TO DESTROY AMERICA'S DEMOCRACY?  https://investigaterussia.org/media/2018-09-11/russian-money-behind-grahams-growing-defense-trump?fbclid=IwAR3uGLDcKWuizr0x9CpLdjI8Ay0lR9G3EfUi06ANgKrO8WorTlx5hujnDNU
I WANT YOU IMPEACHMENT MOTHER FUCKER.
I WOULDNT TO TO EVIL AND NANCY IS THE MOST EVIL PERSON I KNOW. GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF HER DUMBASS SATANIC WAYS.
I Want The WALL
I _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic... The responsibility of government is to protect IT‚ÄôS citizens - not protect illegals. It is an immoral outrage to steal from the American taxpayer in order to give to those who come here illegally and by force.
I agree christine, those life time politicians need to find a new line of work.
I agree we need stronger borders but I would really like to go back to work and take care of my family.   This is getting stupid and it is endangering a lot of people financially.
I agree with you, terry, the rich people only out for, themselves
I agree, ignore piglosi go after the other dems.
I agree, must fix system and secure our borders but please open government for the American people. Deal with her Pelosi  later. Americans need their jobs and income. Most are not looking favorably at shut down. Hurting too many families. Forget pride and help our CITIZENS. Please end the shutdown, looks bad for you and party.
I am 100% with you President Trump for border security, but you should be taking away the paychecks of all members of Congress democrat and republican until this shut down is over.  Keep paying the American people that are affected because of this.  Can you imagine what they are going through not having any money coming in for their families because Congress isn't doing their job!!
I am Muslim and I want to enter the survey helped me
I am a firm Trump supporter. My opinion may not be like other conservatives. I think Trump should propose a way for those who qualify as DACA young people to become US citizens. It should be fair and relatively easy if they have no serious criminal background. If the president and the Rs did this,it would take the wind out of the sails of the Dems for a long time.ü§ì
I am a trump supporter but enough is enough !! Open up our government and forget the wall ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èit will come back on the Dems #karma
I am confused, we are to accept that people die when they serve our country, that is the price we pay, right, accept it. But when it come to the wall, which is for our protection, we are suppose to feel sorry for someone who misses a paycheck, or waits a little long for anything.
I am for Trump 2020 unless he caves for Amnesty
I am from Australia and have watched some of the cnn news reports and numerous other news. Wow! There are clear and present agendas with reporters. Many are not reporting the news in an unbiased way. The way they accuse the President of so many things is appalling. I believe if people over there are accusing the leader of the country without evidence of what they are saying, should be charged with slander. It seems they are accusing with only opinions..theirs!  Wow...show some respect people.
I am not sure I am following your thought here..."39000 killed by American Citizens" OK and? We should ignore any addition from illegals because...?
I am praying for you Mr President. Psalm 109:8 üôèüôèüôè
I am sick and tired of illegals coming into this country and using the system to their benefit.  Don't just build the wall, deport any and all illegals the hell outta here, they are a stain on the underlying pants of society.
I am so tired of hearing what  Nancy Pelosi has to say. You can be sure I am not on her side.
I am so worried about the people that have done nothing wrong and all those workers not getting paid those are the Americans that  are legal and loosing houses and cars being punished for nothing they have control over :( deplorables that voted for President Trump .and the disabled loosing their food :( i understand wanting the wall but punishing Americans for it i dont :( worried how this will end . I was one of those deplorables
I am telling you A**hole Donald J. Trump, and b*tch Lara Trump we don't want no "Wall!" So call Angel Mom, sorry for your lost, but Donald J. Trump is using you as a "pawn" smh...
I am with you 1000percent  Mr President. YOU CAN COUNT ON ME .RECON.
I am with you all the way!  The time has come to fix it and do it now!!!
I am with you all the way, secure our borders
I assume you & those who share your feelings are opening your homes to a dozen "refugees" each.  YOU get to pay their bills - food, clothes, medicine, job training, cell phones, cars - whatever they want.  Let me know how that works out.
I believe in the Wall and I believe in a secure Border!
I believe that TRUMP will be the last American president who will fight as hard for America as he does, all future republican presidents will fold because of their fear of the democraps calling them names like they always do.
I bet the group of families of children killed by inbred, flag waving, fake patriot extremists with war weapons is a MUCH bigger group, Having a pissing-pain contest to get yourself on Faux News and grab the orange imbecile's attention is a waste of their efforts to curb senseless murders.
I blame you Donald J. Trump for this shutdown.  Grow up and declare an emergency if you think it's so urgent you prick.
I can understand the need for the shutdown for such an important issue of the wall. . What I do not understand is WHY are we still paying our representatives  in Congress and the Senate, when they are not doing their job by fixing this. Maybe if they felt the heat that we the people are feeling, they would have a different outlook of what a majority of Americans deal with.  We elect and pay for our representatives whom are not doing their JOB!  They need to be FIRED. Please help if achieve this.
I can't make this statement often enough. I really want to vote for Trump in 2020, but, I won't unless he keep these 3 promises he made to us during his campaign. 1). I want Hillary/The Clinton Foundation prosecuted. 2). I want progress on the Wall. Funding and the wall being started. 3). I want Obama Care repealed. No, I didn't say fixed or a work around or even kind of repealed. I want it Repealed. And NO(!) repealing the "mandate" is NOT the same thing as a repeal. And no, he didn't promise to FIX Obamacare. Donald Trump was clear, he promised to repeal the most oppressive legislation ever imposed on the American people. These points are nonnegotiable; period. Many of you have already told I should reconsider, I've listened to you, with respect, and disagree. We need to do something besides the same old same old thing. The GOP is no longer our friends. Their failure to keep their word on the Obamacare repeal is proof. We all know, or should know by now, they never intended to repeal the most oppressive piece of legislation ever imposed on the American people. Yet, many will tell me "we have to vote for them again". I ask you why? If Trump wants my vote in 2020, he should keep his word.
I cant read. Im a Hillbilly Country Redneck. Rebellion is my Blood. LIBERTY or DEATH
I can‚Äôt believe our Current members of Congress do not care that citizens are being killed by illegal immigrants. We need to recognize the sea change in the Democrat Party and demand answers.....
I could  spend  literally  hours  trying  to change  your  minds as a former  Bush  supporter.  But i won't  waste  my time.   Its apparent.  30 % of this country is fucking stupid
I could really care less just open the freaking government you stubborn bastard!
I could shout it from the rooftops and still my Governor, my Congressman and my Representative would not hear me. I'm just an American tired of my rights being trampled on.
I deeply respect you Mr. President and everything you‚Äôre doing to keep America safe and deal with the border crisis and thank you for everything you have done for us combat veterans.  I sincerely appreciate everything you‚Äôve done I really do.    But please end the government shutdown there are people suffering because of it, there are government employees who have families who can‚Äôt even afford to buy groceries because of the government shutdown and all of the partisan bickering.  Not to mention the rest of the damage being done to the country because of this government shutdown.  Although since Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and the rest of the Democrats refuse to compromise and deal with you they are just as responsible for this government shutdown now if not more responsible for the government shutdown because they will not compromise.    You have a lot of us who are behind you and support you including myself but please don‚Äôt let Nancy Pelosi and Schumer use this shutdown against you.  Please put an end to the government shutdown for the greater good of the country and maybe give the Democrats something they want most to get them to compromise on this and so you can get funding for the wall.  I don‚Äôt know I honestly don‚Äôt have all the answers and right now the government is in crisis it‚Äôs really a sever catch 22 right now.  All I can say for sure is that this government shutdown must end.    I‚Äôve never seen America so divided before and it honestly makes me sad to see my country that I love so much so divided.  We need to unite America again somehow.    God bless you Mr. President we are behind you we support you but please find a way to reopen the government before further damage is done.  I wish you well and I wish your Presidency to be successful sir, God bless you and God bless America!
I did!
I did? When he said he wanted to run for president!
I didn‚Äôt have to use snoops just watched trumps Breaking news. More theatrical lies from trump
I do Not Get HTF so Many smiley faces are put on for this post WTF is wrong with you people As American Citizens yourselves WHY do you find this funny that ANY Legal American Citizens is getting Murdered By Illegal Invaders who have no Business being here in the first place are Killing Our Own ????? You are sick If you think this is ok
I do love it there! But I‚Äôll stay in Brooklyn thanks.
I do not agree with one party or another 100%. No one should. Sadly, people just align with one side or the other despite any logic or critical thinking concerning all of the issues we face. Face the Nation and other credible shows can help broadcast what makes sense for the USA. I did not catch her name but a politician stated today that if we all invested a percentage of our income in health care coverage like we do with SS, we could help solve the health care issue. I totally agree with this and have stated it myself. The key issue is that all or MOST people need to be investing in it. The amount of people getting free health care for them and their ever growing families while on welfare, have increased health care costs. In addition, the amount if people getting SSI for themselves and for their kids (for just about any reason under the sun) is robbing hard working individuals of their financial futures. Why is this allowed? Why do so many welfare recipients continue to have baby after baby while on welfare, getting free everything, raises, free food, health care, housing then get SSI checks for their kids? This lack of requirement for so many to NOT be productive citizens is atrocious. Require people to contribute! And making sure all get health care for a fair percentage of their income is a logical idea as long as all able bodied people contribute! We can not allow open borders until welfare and SSI are revised!
I do not favor a wall because I don‚Äôt think it will be effective. I favor hiring more border patrol agents or stationing troops on the border to turn people away even though it is probably more expensive.
I do not know what Nancy Pelosi really cares about but I'm certain it is NOT women and children, and it is not life, or she would not be such a proponent of abortion.  And though she claims to be Catholic, her daughter's anti-Christian films prove to me this family has no faith in God.
I don't
I don't agree with the DACA deal offered, make them do their jobs and come up with better solution than DACA.
I don't believe Nancy Pelosi should even eat in office. She has proven that she is 100% Democrat doesn't care about our country and who voted her in or total idiots. Can't wait till vote again get rid of Nancy Pelosi
I don't know how how she sleeps at night.
I don't remember Trump pledging to starve Americans but then, as usual, he lied!
I don't think he thought about the fall out that his shutdown would cause. It's not just 800,000 Federal Workers, but it extends to those that these workers owe money to. Local businesses are losing money because residents are not spending. This is very far reaching and is affecting millions. And then there are people who are rationing their medications because they can't afford to get more while they're not getting a pay check. And I would imagine that once the government does open it's going to take a bit of time to start to generate that load of paychecks for distribution.  trump creates messes and then offers to fix them. And his base can not see the obvious!
I don't want a wall. They don't work.
I don't want that stupid wall! With the money for the wall, you could help so many people  AMERICAN PEOPLE !!  BUT YOU DON'T CARE!  :-(
I don't want your idiot impeached. I want him voted out of the Liehouse. üòä
I dont thank God for him but rather pray that God would get this turd ball out of office as this country was and will always be known as the melting pot country and Donald Duck Trump sure knows how to perfect the temper tantrum and truely is making a mockery of our country's political system . It's bad enough he threw a temper tantrum when the vice president took his bouncy ball away from him I could just imagine what's gonna happen when he gets his official eviction notice from the white house. And I also pray the courts take his properties away from him as he needs no power to return as he is trying to create a situation that will bring about martial law and put all of these wal mart stores that have been converted to holding centers into active status and this God for saken wall that he is pushing to build is gonna do one thing and that's lock us in and imprison us supposedly free Americans that are working so hard for him to take our tax money and play a brain game with it just the same as he did with his fake bankruptcy filing to get 2 trump towers in New York City. So please people look at the TRUE facts not fiction before you go supporting a liar , a cheater , and a thief.
I dont want the wall.  I want a President worthy of respect.
I don‚Äôt know how are President does it he tiredly works for us everyday to make our country what is use to be. He doesn‚Äôt take a salary. He is staying  I  in Washington to try and make our lives better. I know the hand of God is on him. Pray our President will be able to continue what he is trying to do for all of us   keep it up President Trump you are doing a great job
I don‚Äôt think she cares what we want.
I don‚Äôt understand why this is taking so long .... most home owners in America have some type of fence around their property for added protection for keeping outsiders out and family in ( animals, kids , etc. )  .... this is basically a bigger fence üôÑ
I don‚Äôt understand. Why didn‚Äôt he tell the Republican speaker of the House the last 2 years to build the wall. Can someone explain that to me?
I don‚Äôt want a $30B wall that won‚Äôt stop any of the  problems.   You want it for your ego and legacy. You are a con man Don.
I don‚Äôt want a wall!!!! I do want you to release your tax returns!!!
I don‚Äôt want the wall!
I don‚Äôt want the wall.
I doubt any of you will figure it out
I feel for National security reasons , the speaker of the house needs to step down.  It is so obvious that they are just holding out until something happens so they can blame the President for the shutdown.  Someone, Vice President,must have the authority to force the speaker of the house to step down for national security ??  Open the government now, please.  ‚ÄúEven before Trump officially made his speech and put protections for young immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on the bargaining table, Democrats denounced the offer, saying it wasn't enough to end the historic shutdown.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Trump's proposal "unacceptable" and said it was a "non-starter" that wouldn't pass in Congress‚Äù.  The government shutdown is almost a month, maybe ask her what would be a starter?  Order her, speaker of the house, to stay at the negotiation table until a deal is made.  Cut her off from whoever is telling her what to do and have them sign a deal to open the government this week please.
I feel sorry for your child being brought up by such a troubled person. Inbreeding I'm guessing.
I feel terrible for these families and I also feel terrible for families that lost their children just because they went to school...there is a gun crisis in this country and that needs addressing...the wall wont do anything to prevent illegals, get real
I find any democrat that has keys to their homes, cars, tool sheds. garages, motor cycles, Gym lockers, to be immoral citizens.
I found this post from a California resident giving his version of what's happening in CA.. "It doesn't matter what color we vote, The Dems have rigged the elections in California.. An illegal gets a driver's license and is automatically registered to vote.. He then gives his absentee ballot to a ballot Harvester Who votes blue and turns in the ballot..Voter ID is not required in CA.."

I fully support the president and his wall, but it's not enough. The wall needs to go into the ground, about 25feet, have seismic sensors to know if anyone is tunneling under it, and be wide enough to patrol on top of it. (Drops mic)
I get all my news from Kremlin State TV, Rump‚Äôs Real News, Alex Jones, Fox and Friends, and The National Enquirer. Good to know I'm well informed.  So I know that if you want to buy a box of cereal, you have to have a voter ID and that Donald gave our soldiers a 10% pay raise. Mexican drug smugglers throw sacks of drugs over the fence and our people get hit on the head with 60 pounds of stuff.  I know the deep state has access to weather weapons capable of not only creating tornadoes but also moving them around, on demand.  I know that the government is using chemicals in order to turn people gay, using a mysterious "gay bomb" devised by the Pentagon. I know that no one died at Sandy Hook Elementary School because the Uniform Crime Reports showed no murders in Newtown for 2012 and the ‚Äúvictims‚Äù were child actors.  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/alex-jones-5-most-disturbing-ridiculous-conspiracy-theories.htmlAlex Jones' 5 most disturbing and ridiculous conspiracy theoriescnbc.com
I guess Angel Families will be shut down soon. Everything Trump touches goes bankrupt or fails some way or another.  #MidasTouch
I guess Liam believes that God likes unfaithful who're chasing husbands.You are a strange kinda Christian Liam.Bet you were not one of Trumps poor college degree scam victims.
I guess since they don't suit your agenda the families of mass shootings are stuck with nothing but thoughts and prayers?  What a complete phony.
I guess you didn't want to chat after all !!!
I guess you don't read too many books?
I hate the world we live in.  I am in the last part of my life.  For that, I am grateful.
I have a question: The Wall has to do with National Security, right? Do ALL matters of 'national security' have to be approved by Congress? I do NOT know how everything works, & I do not know exactly what the Constitution says about this, but it seems to me that, IF a thing is a matter of National Security, the decisions would be made directly by Homeland Security & maybe those in the Pentagon, military leaders & such. Don't they have a budget that is to be used for whatever they need to secure the United States? WHY does it have to be approved by the Legislative branch???***  Since protecting the country & the citizens in it, is one of the primary things that the fed.gov. Is SUPPOSED to do....The Wall isn't anything NEW; it is simply something that HAS been approved of before, but was not acted upon. WHY does it have to be approved again? SERIOUSLY WANTING TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS!* Thanks!*                                                 (( HOW did obama sneak that huge amount of money, cash, without us knowing it? AND, IF Schumer made a proposal for 25 billion for a 'border fence' & border security in 2013, then was that money used up? & if not, where did it go & why isn't IT being used? AND, there certainly hasn't been 700 miles of fencing or wall built, probably EVER!  We've seen pictures. Pathetic.(I read Politifact; it said that that proposal didn't get picked up by the House after it went thru the Senate in 2013) AND, when the left speaks of a 'fence'...hahaha....EVERYONE KNOWS  a fence won't keep out those wanting to climb & dig under a fence, OUT. A 'fence' is a joke, & it's just to pacify.  Pelosi says that to have a 'wall',is not what our country(ok, nancy....EXPLAIN...what is our country???) .....Well, I SAY, OUR GREAT COUNTRY IS NOT A DOORMAT!****AND, we're not into SLOPPY UN-DISCIPLINED OPERATIONS.*To just allow anyone to come & trample on it's land, laws or principles, & try to take over.....just so the oldies in the congress can have dem votes.....now THAT'S Pathetic.....You know what??? Hahahaha! IF the DACA people get to stay, after they get really situated & become citizens, I bet they'll ALL VOTE REPUBLICAN!* Cause they will have seen enough of the dem confusion & chaos.I bet California WILL go Red! Cause when things get so bad, people revolt....& the chaos is coming from the left, not the right. I don't know, but maybe by then, there'll be a Nationalist party or a stronger Libertarian Party, etc. & maybe dems will change their name to 'socialist party'. >>Draining the swamp-----WWG1WGA üëçüá∫üá∏
I have an idea President Trump, why don't you threaten to tear down the walls at the California and Texas borders.  Then we'll see just how quickly Pelosi (and all the American people that cannot see the value and necessity of having walls and security) realizes that we need them...  Anyone is welcome into our country as long as you are vetted, non-criminals, healthy, and legal.  The same process our grand, great grand, great great grand parents had to go through.  Filled out the proper paper work, quarantined until well, became legal and paid taxes, and turned away if they were criminals.  It is much, much easier for the Cartel and terrorists (from all over the world) to get into our country from Mexico.  This is really scary America!  We need security at our borders, people!
I have been on her site and like many others there, we have voiced our American displeasure with her, but I believe it is falling on deaf, paid off ears....
I have been watching videos on OSCAR EL BLUE and Anthony facebook pages.   It makes me worry for our country.
I have heard many Democrats say "Oh Trump is a billionaire Tycoon trying to use the government to get rich"--> Sorry but Trump is not the owner of a steel factory or oil company or drug company-- this is not how I understand Trump made his mark --> instead he made his mark in the toughest real estate market in the world: NY.  Now if you ask me, Trump is trying to help the economy FOR REAL because wealthy Americans PAY THEIR RENT ON TIME! this is a win-win.  This is super easy to see.. and by the way, IF YOU DONT LIKE LIVING THERE: MOVE!
I have lost any respect that I have had for you!  It is not about you politicians---it is about securing my country.  I resent you snd have zero respect for your self-serving party.
I have never seen a President so committed to America's SAFETY and GREATNESS Like President Donald J. Trump.
I have said are immigration system is not broken at all !!! What is broken is CONGRESS that what broken down!!!! For thirty years no one care about fixing the border and they have let DRUGS and illegals come in as they please.. For company's to have cheap labor at the cost of poor Americans that are and had been out of a job. And none of them even care till Donald J. Trump came into are life's !!! Donald J Trump don't sleep in the bed with Democrats and Republicans and that what we the people love about  him so much. What is broken is Republicans and Democrats that sold there very souls to the devil in order to get RICH .. And even the MEDIA has done the same thing people. And (( WE THE PEOPLE GET THE BILL FOR IT ALL )) don't BE FOOL PEOPLE BY WHAT THEY SAY)) .We the people need TERM LIMITS on Congress ASP Four term is all !!!!!!!!!! Take the crooks out of there chairs people .
I have the opportunity to share with you the wise advice=if you want me to.My heart aches for the safety of world civilization=but I am very poor financially.You might want to give me some personal help =as a charity for the orphans I'm raising.Write to me, do you have the desire to provide me with financial assistance?
I have told her, over and over again!!!! She doesn't care about Citizens safety!!
I hire illegal immigrants in my business.
I hope and pray that you‚Äôre hands are tied over this. We are all ready to blow a f- ing cork. We have also reached our limit on this border crisis. Shut it the f-!! Down until further notice!!
I hope he types better than Charles?
I hope you did report him
I just heard on the news another illegal immigrant that's been here for a year illegally has killed four people in Nevada so you lefties want open borders
I just sent it to my husband , he‚Äôll get to the right people üòä BF Goodrich will also be notified that one of their employees is using their work skills to make threats  online
I just want to get paid
I know this is NOT fake News! In the News today!üò≤ Shocking News! Nancy Pelosi is not a strong woman. She just has groping hands üò≤üò≤üò≤
I know what to do, immigrants run to boarders, let's give them what they want, more boarders! When they pass Americas boarders they collect $200 like monopoly, to help them cross over the Canadian boarder. What do you think Mr. Presidenta
I know you are taking a lot of pressure, but hold your ground, YOU are our only chance of having a secure border!!!   Thank you President Trump.  God Bless!!
I know you will do every thing you said you would do for America and her people. God bless you Mr. President
I like that Donald is using Nancy‚Äôs name rather than some silly nickname. Our little man is growing up and acting like an adult!
I like your dad, But you Lara! You should not talk!!!!!!
I live in Texas, I challenge every member of Congress who has voted against the wall to camp on the border (El Paso or Laredo, their choice) with zero security for a couple of nights...bet that wall will get funded! ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è
I love mom
I love my President!! #MAGA
I love our President andcthink Pelosi and her voters are traitors
I love that you are for importing.........importing your wives!!!!
I love the fact the white house now has their own news channel just like CNN or fox ..except this one has real news non of that poison cnn dishes out
I love the fighter in him.Finally a President with a backbone willing to stand up and fight for the American people.
I love this news with Laura Trump! Studio 45!
I love watching trump lose everyone knows it‚Äôs a trump shutdown he thought he would make deals through twitter but he‚Äôs losing like a bitch maybe a hooker pissing on him would cheer him up
I love what Mr. Trump is doing !! But the shutdown is taking the wrong people paycheck. If you take the one‚Äôs who is trying to stop it paychecks they will agree to it by the end of the week!!!!
I love when Texans complain about Mexicans. If you hadn't stolen a part of their country you wouldn't have that problem.
I love when she says ‚ÄúThank you Laura‚Äù not Lara üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I love you mr. Trump I love the way you scamed senior citizens of there life savings with a phony college! I love the way you grab women's puss+. I love the way you cheated on your wife after she had your son. I love the way with the shutdown your making people lives like hell!        I LOVE YOU MR. PRESIDENT!                          NOT!!
I made a pledge to vote for anyone else running against you.
I mean let's look at your history? Multiple failed wars, Multiple Economic Crashes, Slavery, Genocide, Religious Hatred...and you still repeat the cycle like a Merry-Go-Round? Seriously, can one of you Republican morons actually tell me when America was great the first time before trying to scream #MAGA at me? I bet you can't?
I mean, if you're going to have a puppet president, at least make him or her likable.
I need your assistance please
I never said that about Don's stablemate.
I never saw so much hate in my life for a President , that shows what the Democrats are! Vile ,liars , low ! so many families lost the loved ones ... committed by  Illegals,  and more millions more   want  to invade  to  our Country ,it is outrageous !
I pledge to speak up about your absurdities and bullshit until you quit, are impeached, imprisoned or gone some other way. You trump, are a ridiculous human, a clear and present danger to all and a fucking fool.
I pray for HIM! He"s THE BEST!
I pray that the orange russian back traitor is impeached.  We do not need the idol to the deplorables.
I pray to God above to guide you President Trump, and give you the ability to maintain the Strength it takes to pull America out of the pit of Hell that some people are fighting so hard to pull us all into.  Constant, non stop prayers and FULL SUPPORT for you President Trump and those who are your loyal and faithful to HOLD STRONG.  <3  <3  <3
I promise  i actually  don't  care  about  politics,  i truly  think  this  guy is real  dangerous  person.  And all of his supporters  that  demand  a wall are just  sucker's
I read all of the comments here and it makes me embarrassed to be a Republican... everyone is just name calling like our President. No wonder nothing gets done if this is the mentality of our party. I was hoping we would MAGA again but I am beginning to see that Trump is just a clown and a joke as are his supporters. I am embarrassed that I voted for this fool.  #TurningBlue
I remember you mocking a gold star family over the death of their son.
I respect what you're doing and I know you plan on changing these immigration laws as well we need good people in this nation from other countries that are an asset to this nation rather than just a burden although I can appreciate anyone looking for a better life. We need people with great minds great worth ethics honest people that are interested in being Americans not just living off our land and spitting in our faces
I rewrote the letter and send it.  I want the wall to stem the overwhelming tide of human trafficking, drug trafficking, and weapons, trafficking.  Our elected officials first and foremost priority should be the American People and the USA..  I do not vote party.  I am an independent.  WE NEED TERM LIMITS.
I say give pamphlets of towns and address of all those opposed to the wall to those coming over without proper papers. and they can put up tents and campers for them in there front and backyards. I think that would be a nice jester. While I put a wall around my place guarded by pit bulls german shepherds 30-06 and a Glock 9.
I say the president starts fining the people fighting the wall .. you know like Obama did with Obamacare
I seem to recall Mr Trump that Peace in the Middle East was on you to do list when you became President. Will that be happening any time soon? You've only got two years left.
I sent her a brick.
I sent it one on behalf of my husband and one on my behalf.  Check it out!
I sent my letter! Democrats have to help to protect our country, President Trump and Republicans need bi partisan support for this crisis. Caravans of people keep marching to the border, something has to be done immediately!!!!
I sent the letter.
I sent this to Ann kirkpatrick
I sent to her my letter And also i was very clear  writing in my explanation. I hope she understands my concerns and worries.
I signed it
I signed the letter.
I signed the petition. #BuildTheWall

I smell bullshit
I stand with POTUS 45!!
I stand with President Trump BUILD the WALL and I pray for President Trump daily Trump 2020
I stand with Trump.
I stand with you president!!
I stand with you, Mr. President.
I still don‚Äôt want a wall- didn‚Äôt 300+ people just go under a tunnel to a border patrol staffed by 3.  I am for enhancing security, but stop your silly insistence on a wall. Most drugs and illegals are coming in other ways. You can‚Äôt fool everyone. Open the government !

I support President Trump! BUILD THE WALL
I support him all the way
I support the Wall
I support you Mr. President! I was informed California Democrats love illegal immigrants so they can give free benefits with voting rights to be Democrat so Democrats in office can continue holding power. Desperate and underhanded. I am a 3rd generation Californian and my mom just retired at 75 because she could not afford to sooner.
I support you, but it's time to stop using Federal Workers as a whipping post.  I was one for 30 years.  End the Shutdown and stop freezing their wages.  There must be another way to build the Wall.
I swear for the ones that don't want this country to be better secured & wants to allow it to get worse why don't u go live with them in Mexico if you like that kind of life so much.   And for the idiots that keep sayin the wall isn't gona keep them out blah blah blah. We know it won't keep them all out but we need something to slow them down where they can be stopped. It takes a lot of man power to guard & stop them when there's so much of the border that's absolutely nothing there. It would be like locking the doors on your house. It'll keep more from breaking in so easy but won't stop them all. But you leave your house everyday with your doors unlocked & see how many times your house is invaded.
I tend to think of Trump as the antithesis of a politician, Trump is a pragmatic businessman that see blatant waste and lawless ambition of politicians. And absolutely he cares more about United states citizens more than any other president since the founders.
I thankful that we still have a President and other Republicans that care about the Angel families!  Pelosi refused to meet with them. What a sorry excuse of a Congresswoman. Disgusting and those voting for her party one day will be sorry.
I think Congress should not be paid until all of this is settled
I think Nancy Pelosi would be much happier if she stop using her head as a suppository!
I think all of our Congress has been vacinated with a phonograph needle.  By the time they have all stopped talking at the same time, we will have lost our Freedom and will be a Third World Nation of losers. Remember God gave us two ears and one mouth. We should listen twice as much as we talk.   Everyone loves a Winner!  üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ USA!
I think it makes it so hard for victims of any kind to not be heard or feel as if they are shut out and refused options then being forced to keep living a negative experience to a certain degree..def prolongs the healing process.. I think the wall is a good idea to protect us and put limitations to  Such severe ongoing issues regarding various trafficking matters and also helping with getting other things in order with any other system in place that offers opportunity and financial benefit for people who do come and live here legally.. We also have to consider there are also victims on the other side of that wall and need to play a role in helping control those issues as well because not everyone trying to come here has Ill intentions and are just trying to seek safety just the same .. Such a huge issue and hard to find the right approach to help resolve all matters
I think the President is trying to distract all this attention about the wall for reasons of his own. The truth will cone out in time.
I think the President should declare by executive order that there will be no pay for any member of Congress until the Border Crisis is settled!!
I thought Mexico was going to pay for the wall. How many times did you get your mindless fools to chant that in your fascist rallies?
I thought it was meant to SOLVE the problem not delay it?
I thought the news was all "fake"?
I thought the president could build the wall without her by declaring a national emergency if so do it.
I totally support you, President Trump. The Democrat Socialists are traitors to our country.
I use my Brain. Works way better.
I voted for Donald Trump, Therefore He knows I want the Wall. You can not tell or ask A Evil Hateful person like Nancy anything about Saving America, because her Goal is to Destroy America.
I voted for Trump but i need my refund!!
I want   the  wall
I want Nancy GONE! ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
I want Pelosi on a stick. We don't always get what we want. That is a lesson that is hard for people to gbrasp. They have been coddled so much, even allowing men in dresses to pee with our children in public restrooms. Finally, a strong man who doesnt bend when folks don't like him. He doesn't care! He is not president to bend, break or hold you when you whine. He is more likely to whoop your ads and invite you to get up or get out. Its hard to be told no I guess. People has lost their moral compass. Pesident Trump is about leading with a firm hand.
I want Trump to shove the wall down all the Democrats throats just like Obama and the other evil San Fran Nan shoved Obamacare down ours!!!
I want USA safe and free from socialism, communism and other threats. Build the wall.
I want a good fence
I want a wall to stem illegal immigration/invasion of our country.
I want a wall!
I want legal immigration only Please keep our country safe and secure
I want the WALL. Build it.
I want the Wall
I want the darn wall.
I want the wall
I want the wall ! One reason I voted for him! Our country is being taken over and soon it won't be the country we were privileged to grow up in! Look what has happened to it in the last few years ! They are breaking the law people ! Obama 's 8 years in office nearly destroyed us!
I want the wall Nancy
I want the wall Nancy  Pelosi
I want the wall nancy
I want the wall now speaker Pilosi  now, ,
I want the wall!
I want the wall!!!
I want the wall.
I want the wall.,deportation and NO DACA DEALS
I want to know how Pelosi was even allowed to run for public office again? Did we all forget she stole tax payer dollars to fly her and her family across the country? Mr. President, ask Nancy Pelosi if she has reimbursed the tax payers money. I am a father of four, I do concrete, brick amd block for a living, I got an overpayment from unemployment and had to pay the overpayment plus a very large penalty of $500 so I believe she should have to pay a penalty of 25% of every dollar she stole from the tax payers, she knowingly defrauded the tax payers.
I want to tell Nancy to start working....And also working for Americans! Work it out!!
I was never in the country. That's the problem with you Republican idiots, always believe everything you read on the internet :')
I was tboned by a illegal alien in Philadelphia. I can barely walk. Forth surgery on the way. I am a single parent, sole support, and private contractor. I lost months of work and barely making it !
I wat the wall
I will be glad to tell Nancy I want that wall right after I tell her what I think of her. POS!
I will tell Nancy to keep kicking you in the balls Trump...
I will tell her I am for the wall if you Resign and move to Mexico!  Deal?  #DontheCon
I will thank you. My fav is Black Cherry üòä
I will vote for a temporary wall in exchange for a temporary extension of DACA
I wish Donald Trump would get the same thing that Martin Luther King jr. Got he deserves it
I wish I could give her a hug. üò¢‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
I wish you cared about gun violence. That's a bigger problem
I wish you would put all this fear mongering behind our students who are more at risk then anyone. But that's right you really don't give a crap about them
I wonder if your frothy followers realize that the primary purpose of this page is sell them crap.
I wonder what he has on Nancy some dirt and she is a he will rip in to her.
I would like nancy and chukie in a hole
I would like to tell Nancy to get lost!!
I would miss your stupidity :D
I wouldn't tell that witch anything.
I wrote a note, it goes to Duncan Hunter and Pelosi.. you should too Maria Diona Fakhoury John Gewarges
I'LL TELL RONALD U WANT SOME HAMBERDNERS U DANG PUSSYHAT!!!!
I'am not surprised that she will not meet with them...
I'd be happy if she just actually did any work... Get to the table and work things out.  Stop her paychecks.
I'll take a thousand migrants willing to walk 2,000 miles across a desert in hopes of a making a better life in America over one privileged smirking insolent snot-nose MAGA hat-wearing teenage dipshit asshole any day of the week and twice on Sunday
I'm British (well your opinion doesn't count) None of them is MY president lol I can just spot weakness when I see it :D
I'm a huge Trump supporter but he made it appear that he had closed the deal on the wall.  Instead he comes out with this whimpy proposal lol
I'm done with him. I've asked 5 times.  He obviously doesn't want to put a comment statement on here..... because he doesn't know how to answer the question. It's EXACTLY what I expected.... and EXACTLY why I continued to ask. It was to prove a point. I've done that. So y'all have a nice day. I've got to get out my 4 wheel drive John Deere tractor I paid cash for and grade the snow off my 7/10 mile long driveway into my farm here in Kentucky... so my wife can get her Chrysler 300 M out of the garage and make it up to the guest house. Dang! I just wish I had that CFO money that ole James Ahssanipoor makes. That way I could pay someone to do that for me. That dude says he NEVER has to work because he's obviously rich. You know....  being CFO and trader and all. He's not conceited either! He's just convinced! BAHAHAHAHA  You've at least been VERY cheap entertainment James. Have a nice day sir. üòÇ
I'm from Canada and it's not hard to see who the issue is!  That old Pelosi bitch should go out to pasture!  It would be nice if our young  Trudeau bitch could go with her!!
I'm glad we have a President that is actually doing something for the American people. Build the wall that's what most of us want! Don't think Congress should get paid while the government is shut down. After all they don't do their jobs.
I'm guessing all the Agents have American Visas so how will Trumps Wall of Hate stop that?
I'm impressed President Trump that you haven't called a national emergency yet.. When will the Demos wake the F up. Stay strong President Trump
I'm just more intelligent than you and you don't like it ;)
I'm not a billionaire, I don't own any Presidents.
I'm not rooting, neither are my family or friends. Speak for yourself, you are the minority now and always. God bless. #ACPQ #TrumpShutdown
I'm not talking about "What Obama did" it was years ago. Seriously that's the only arguement you people ever have? Its pitiful :D
I'm one of those on the right who thinks armed conflict is a must on truely take the country back I mean after all we are dealing with a bunch of POS Socialist commie's from the left, I'd say give them a choice and that is either move to a more Socialists country of your choosing or die, hell with the 100+million deaths due to Socialism I'd say you POS Liberal socialist commie's on the left have it coming FK you all and your enablers!
I'm sad to hear this but American's do drugs\drink and then get behind the wheel and drive too. Remember Mother's Against Drunk Drivers?
I'm so sorry Mr. President but the "art of the deal" only works when you are working with sane people. The DNC is now a matter of the lunatics are running the asylum. We must not ever let these people win, ever. Where was the RNC during the mid terms, they did no get out the vote efforts, no voter registration, and did nothing to stop ballot harvesting in nursing homes, and did not challenge provisional ballots. The RNC fails us continually.
I'm sorry you still believe in a man proven to be immoral (not just adultery but scamming workers from their pay and much more), rude, disrespectful to our men and women in service and veterans; a man with the demeanor of an angry spoiled child who happily watches people having to go to food banks, some even putting their homes up for sale, because this man, this one you still believe in, will not accept what has ALREADY been offered in a bipartisan offering to add to the billion he hasn't spent yet on border security. This is a TEMPER TANTRUM! Do you have children? Would you let all the other children suffer because of the actions of one? And yet you believe in him still. That brings into question either your own morality or your intelligence, not something I can know. But you do. and also? He's just not a smart person. Period. https://www.mediaite.com/tv/trump-says-border-wall-has-worked-in-san-antonio-a-city-100-miles-north-of-the-border-that-has-no-wall/?fbclid=IwAR2voiI0QTACXj-u-XyOjbZmcobdPnAyzG6odsyL45YmI1nZ53kORt-Kg-0
I'm sure "god" is rewarding them as we speak? :')
I'm telling Nancy and Chuck to keep knocking your demented ideas out of the stadium. We all want border security that actually works. Walls didn't work during medieval times protecting castles and they don't work to this day. You can go over, under, around or through ANY wall. A wall still needs manpower and technology power to be secure. You're all a bunch of uninformed children of immigrants, EVERY ONE OF YOU!!!!
I'm telling Pelosi, and anyone else who's in ear-shot, FUND BORDER SECURITY.  DON"T FUND THE WALL!
I've read every one of them. ALL that I asked for is for you to say I voted for....   Because...... But I guess that's just too difficult for a CFO that says they NEVER work. It actually requires a minimum amount of WORK. Really not difficult. You're just not willing to answer the question because I'll make you look stupid.  Too late pal. By NOT answering. You already do.  Just sayin.....
I, have no tolerance to hatred and bigotry.
IDIOT all this BULLSHIT from you i lie and lie and lie, you are really ill i youre head, and im so sad that there are so many sick Americans who are voting for you, they have apparently forgotten that the United States arose because of immigrants, even your own wife is not real American, so you are so far out. Is your wife also a criminal and a drug addict, just like anybody you mention now, maybe she is since she is married to someone like you
IF THE LAWS WERE ENFORCED TO PUT EMPLOYER'S IN JAIL AND FINE THEM FOR HIRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, THEN THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WOULD QUIT COMING HERE....ALSO GIVE A REWARD TO PEOPLE WHO CALLS IN AND REPORTS ILLEGALS WORKING IN FACTORYS ECT...
IF THIS IS WHAT PRAYER IN SCHOOL TEACHES I‚ÄôD SAY IT‚ÄôS A FAIL. McCONNELL‚ÄôS HOME STATE. THE GOP & TRUMP‚ÄôS DEAL WITH RUSSIA IS AN ILLEGAL FARCE. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/catholic-school-investigate-taunting-native-americans-n960626?cid=sm_npd_ms_fb_ma
IMPEACH THE MOTHERFUCKER
IN GOOD OLD PLAIN ENGLISH...,just build the wall   PLEASE
INCOMPETENT, BUMBLING OLD FOOL
ISIS funded by Israel and Saudi Arabia. USA will not be framed for this evil agenda. Get 9/11 reinvestigated now
Ida Lisa Heard Bahaha!! Who got her plane snatched out from under her!!! Nancy. Love that line! Best laugh all day!
Ida Lisa Heard They did pass a budget.  Drumpf refused to sign it after Ann Coulter and other Fox News personalities lit his ass up.  The idiot makes his decision based on tv shows.
Idiot
Idiot troll
Idiots to the left of me....idiots to the right!ü•¥
If  only  she  would  listen.
If Dr. MLK Jr. was still alive he would be a friend and supporter of the POTUS.
If Hillary won the country would be invading Iran for Israeli interests. Get 9/11 reinvestigated as the Saudi's have ties to Zionist Israel.
If I could tell Nancy anything it would be to resign and go to hell.
If I want to know what Putin's ass tastes like. I'll ask you. Because that's the only thing that you're truly good at.
If I was Trump I'd set up a scheduled meeting for Nancy Pelsoi in the oval office. But I'd lock the door and laugh and laugh and laugh when she stood on the other side saying "I can't get in!" Teach a man to fish. Walls do work. That's why we have walls.
If I were you I would give those DACA idiots permanent residency to shut dems mouth and then see what will be the arguments not to give you the money for border security and the wall!!
If I'm behind our President on any of his undertakings because I definitely don't agree with all of them, I'm behind him on this one 1000%+
If Mexico don't stop the Caravans,  Shut the Border down of all vehicle crossing at the ports of entry.  They will change their tune in a hurry.
If Nancy  is so worried  about the works not getting  paid do like Trump give your pay to them , you selfish  Bitch
If THAT WAS TRue, Why didn‚Äôt you promise to make lying, bearing false witness, and evil propaganda illegal and unlawful.  Especially when it comes to lying to masses. That‚Äôs should be a capital offense.
If Trump gets his wall, he holds his campaign promise and will probably get elected again because of it. This is why the Democrats are not funding the wall. They care more about bringing Trump down, then national security.  They are going to rely on the youth to start voting in 2020. The youth want to start a revolution and can't even start a lawnmower üôÑ
If anyone tells you that walls do not work, they are liars!
If democrats cared so much about Americans not working then the government would be open! TRUMP wants 5 billion we spend 150 billion on illegal  immigration a year ! That sounds LIKE a good reason to build the WALL and democrats couldn't care less about the American people . It's ALL about political power! Shame on u people
If dont have the smart people in US how can the country high ?? US is the high country in the world ..‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
If government employees want to go back to work, they need to contact their state Democrat  representatives and hold them accountable for being more concerned with politics then the wellbeing of their constituents.  Majority of Americans want the Wall. We need the Wall!
If he can't go down in History as the best President.  He would rather go down as the worst.  It's all about what HE can do. If you haven't figured that out, you are the problem.
If he wants to stop all the drug trafficking and all these drugs that day busted all that money that they show that They confiscated why they do not use all of that money toward the wall a lot of money they show that they got from Chapo why don't they use that money as well we as American shouldn't have to deal with the price of building it
If his pledge to them is anything like the pledge to the kids in Parkland they shouldn't get their hopes up.
If it wasn't an emergency during the two years when he had GOP majorities in both chambers of Congress, I doubt he can prove it is an emergency now.
If it wasn't for the "Well, what about" arguments, you guys would have nothing. Let's live in the now!
If it's a trump. It lues.
If make new Mount Rushmore    4 presidents are Einsenhower,Nixon,Reagan And Trump
If nothing else, the people laughing at other‚Äôs misery and sadness, I‚Äôm not speaking for anybody else, but here‚Äôs hoping #KARMA is out and about.... Hopefully you‚Äôre gotten to in a timely manner... On another note üìù. How about that global warming Al Gore, it‚Äôs colder than House Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs lack taters.....
If only Nancy and her band of loons would get their head out of their a**
If only the Native Americans had thought like that :(
If only you people had your priorities straight. You don't care about murder or human suffering. If you did, you'd be fighting the many things that cause far more murder, suffering and death. There's a long list before "that time an immigrant was crazy."
If running the government is your job and the government is shut down doesn't that make you a failure? Asking for a friend.
If schools would actually do something about the bullies in their schools, we wouldn't have half the shootings we do now. The schools claim to have zero tolerance, but when you actually report it, they claim that kids will be kids. So you want safety inside, then they need to fix their bullying policies, and start expelling all kids that have been know to bully others. This is the schools problem to fix, not Trumps.
If that is what you  believe Victor decinti
If that's the case it has to be a borders to be fair, if not it's prejudice.
If that‚Äôs true, then arrest Shmuker and Palosi for treason and not performing their oath of office. Need to get this party started.
If the Democrats will not meet you half way or even come to the table then a STATE OF EMERGENCY IS APPROPRIATE! We cannot wait any longer!
If the House and Senate worked as hard as The President, think of all the important things hat could get done.
If the Progressive Democrat Party, an offshoot of communism as is socialism and fascism does not accept Saturday's proposal from President Trump, it is time to adjust the size of the federal government to the funded level and combine the unfunded agencies with the funded government eliminating all nonessential jobs and services. The Progressivism Democrat Party uses Communist tactics and is dysfunctional in a democratic form of government. They are not negotiating because they cannot. Their ideology does not let them.
If the democrats do not take the offer over DACA they are going to lose another large portion of their voting base...
If the government wont help you build this wall plenty of hardworking American people will if you make a go fund me account and share it on Facebook I know plenty of people who would donate... just saying.
If there is no money in the budget for the border wall, just take it out of the Congress's pension fund.  You know like they did with our social security!  üéØüí≤üí≤üî¥
If there was concrete proof against President Trump would the insane liberal media need to attack kids?  https://youtu.be/rpoTGUSRTwA
If they don't agree to build the wall this week, just do it anyways!  We stand behind you Sir! Be blessed!
If this administration truly wanted to do something about immigration they would do something about the Dreamers and they would come up with some solutions for processing immigrants at the border. A huge wall is a waste of taxpayers money! Repair the fences that already exist first. Add more border control, drones, cameras, etc..
If u made a pledge then start funding the Coast guard
If walls dont work, why do prisons have them and not drones? So dumb!!!
If we stop giving illegals food stamps, healthcare....etc, then we will have the money to BUILD THAT WALL üá∫üá∏
If you are so high and mighty , take some of the illegals and let them live with you.
If you cave and give amnesty you will lose my vote along with a majority of your voters. Stay the course Mr. President.
If you consider Merkel as the one who splits the country you attribute more importance to her than she deserves!
If you defund planned parenthood you could pay for the wall in 30 years without even changing the budget... just saying.
If you don't support Veterans that's your business in this free country. If you protest them? Remember I am one of them. My rights matter too and I know a lot more than you.
If you don‚Äôt want the wall move out of America  you don‚Äôt belong here. We want the wall demon
If you intend to compromise about DACA, to extend their privilege to stay here, Homeland security should charge $1,000.00 each for the application.And also $1,000.00  for TPS. Homeland security will be able to fund the wall with their revenues. Over 10 billion dollars. And you can say Mexicans pay .
If you know a Federal employee, just ask them what they think is more important, their next paycheck or Trump‚Äôs folly.
If you put a laughing reaction, you are TRASH!
If you say so. And I have no Trump supporting friends. You're all idiots. #NotSarcasm
If you voted for Trump because he promised you a wall, blame him. Last January he had full funding secured and reneged. Last June he had an immigration bill and completely botched it, flip flopping on issues and being uninformed. 2 years of total Republican control and they managed to force an unpopular tax bill and add $2 trillion to the debt.  Trump could have delivered the wall, even if Mexico paying was a lie, and he did not deliver either by choice or incompetence.  House Democrats were elected in part to oppose the wall. 60% of the public opposes it. They are doing right by their voters.  They never promised a wall.   If you're upset there's no wall Trump promised you and he failed you.
If you want to make America great  resign the presidency. #TrumpIsAMoron
If you want your stupid wall so bad, pay for it with your own wealth. Stop trying to steal America's money and bankrupt our economy like you do your business.
If you're the President for America maybe you should start listening to the majority instead of you minority base. https://www.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-poll-ocasio-cortez-ideas-for-trump-border-wall-money-2018-12?fbclid=IwAR1lAk_R3XBVvL-rETCXRFUAyFjvQEkHlNVt2bEtOEJ0vOLiDwN8MAFialQ
If you‚Äôre really that butt hurt, pull a Frank Underwood and use FEMA to appropriate the funds to build your wall #impeachthetosser #australiaswatching
If, this touched Nancy‚Äôs family she might have some compassion!  I believe Nancy‚Äôs heart is made of stone!  Everything she says or does is for her power gain!  Praying God brings her feet back on the ground!
Ignore Nancy!  Take a vote from the American people.  Then build the wall.
Ijeoma Amaka WHAT?
Illegal immigrants are far less likely to commit crimes  than native-born Americans.  The number of illegal immigrants has decreased over the past 10 years.   Dare to learn the truth  and not believe Trmp's lies.
Illegal in Las Vegas on a killing crime spree. See if this makes the national news! https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alleged-ms-13-members-charged-after-yearlong-vegas-killing-spree-police-say#
Illegals are killing 12 Americans daily and they are not stopping to ask are you Democrats, Republicans, conservative or liberals..This is why I don't understand why anyone would be against adding a strong wall to stop these killers
Im a Bush  supporter  and a Republican.....
Im fine with Trump's proposal of temporary protection  for DREAMers for 3 years in exchange for the wall, if the wall also is only protected for 3 years.  After 3 years we can tear what's been built down.  I mean it's not money out of our pocket, right?  Mexico is paying!
Im sorry for your loss
Imagine if Hillary had been elected  !
Imagine, 4 years ago the thought of building a wall along the southern border never entered your minds. Now it is all you talk and think about. Why? Could it be your thought process is being manipulated? You will say no, but think long and hard about why this has become a point of contention. If this can be made something you argue about with anyone who disagrees, what else have you been duped into believing? Think about it. Project MKUltra
Immigrants harassing a Native Veteran wearing MAGA hats that support a pig that pays for hookers while he‚Äôs married being sent to ‚Äúprotest‚Äù by a Catholic school.    Did I leave anything out??
Immigrants, including illegal immigrants, commit fewer crimes than other Americans. We statistically have LESS to worry about when it comes to illegals.

Instead of a wall, why not build sniper towers every mile. Anyone that comes within 100M of the border gets sniped. How many do you think you will have to kill before they get the message? I‚Äôm sure be lots people,that would man the towers.
Instead of sucking up to the coal and petroleum industries why dont you invest in Green , environmentally friendly technology. There is no future in fossilized fuels, green is the way to go. Educate the work force in modern technology,  stop lining your own pockets, donnie.

Investigate as to how Nancy Pelosi has accumulated 100 million dollars. Hmmmm.
Iris Nielsen no he is not, the people who oppose him and are trying to bring him down are the enemies of our country, even if they are American citizens
Iris Nielsen you are a idiotical statement. STOP DRINK THE KOOL-AID FROM CNN AND MSNBC ANF BUZZFEED AND ETC.!!!
Is Pelosi in a drunken stupor that she can‚Äôt hear people telling her ‚ÄúBuild the wall‚Äù?
Is she? I don't know about you, but it seems the sheep would be the ones believing everything the media giants and celebrities have to say. ü§î
Is that what smoke trump is blowing up his supporters asses now?
Is the pledge the same as the one where you said Mexico will pay for the wall? You do know walls won't stop this from happening, dumbass. üôÑ
Is there a law that if the speaker of the house is so adamant and ditrustive, about making any law work in Congress with the President that you can override her, excuse me but she isn‚Äôt the President! And Thank God for that! Her arrogance is getting to everyone,

Is this TRUE - Laura dear, check this please '50 Billion set aside in the 2006 Secure Fence Act'. Can that be true, is it true. If so where did the money go. Where did the taxpayer CASH go, down a sink hole. Was that down south money ??
Is this the same poll that said Hillary Clinton would be our next president that no way could Donald Trump wIn.

Isn't it funny how cnn didn't even mention that CA cop killed by the Illegal? Even as the funeral was going on ? Wonder why? Huh?
Israel and Russia are basically fascist dictatorships with zero morals and who rule with propaganda torture and corruption
Israel and Russia have walls and military protecting its borders. The USA must do the same thing and secure its borders.
Israel has a wall and military protecting its borders. Most of the left is all about Israel first. Why not America first???
Israel has ties to Saudi Arabia via Zionism. Many Arabs are Zionists. Get 9/11 reinvestigated now!
Israel is holding the USA back from prospering.
Israel sends illegals to Cali via Hispanic commie leaders.
It DOESN'T matter how tall or deep the wall is.Them coyotes are smarter.We need new technology to secure our borders.
It IS
It doesn't matter how it gets done, build the wall!!!! One America life taken by an illegal person is too much for this country to bear. Yet we have hundreds. Stop the madness and protect American citizens.
It doesn't work like that. If it did wouldn't he have done that 2 years ago. Why hold the country hostage now out of the blue? My guess is he is mad the Dems took the house and scared to death of what Mueller has on him as he watches all of his associates go to prison. This is his big distraction and its failing BIGLY.
It is her way or the high way President Trump study her personality he going for other side . Selfish woman stiff broom up her *** ride on her broom.
It is interesting to me that there are 23 million Trump followers and only 4 thousand comments on this thread screaming for a wall and some how you think you are the majority or that this is what people want... it's not!  The majority of people recognize that 3 years of DACA in exchange for 5 billion for a wall (which is grossly underbudget to complete, estimates are upwards of 30+ billion BTW) makes about as much sense as pissing in the wind... they only reason he made this offer is because it is a meaningless gesture that he thinks he can use to paint democrats as not caring about Dreamers.... he is the one that unilaterally dismantled the program.  SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP MR PRESIDENT.  We aren't as stupid as you are.
It is normal, democratic, American politics for the executive and legislative branches of government to bargain & negotiate over competing policy preferences. It is not normal, democratic, or American for the paychecks of workers to be held hostage while doing so.
It is not safe where I live as I face the chance if being shot dead.
It is not your pledge, but your method that sucks.
It is pass the time to inform Nancy  what to do ..........it is time to DEMAND her to build the wall or else
It is sad when the president must fight for the rights of citizens over the rights of those who want to invade our country illegally!  Meanwhile the Democrats are more concerned with rights of illegals!  As a voting citizen, I expect my representatives to protect us and maintain law and order in our country.  The path to freedom was given to us by men and women who fought for us.  Those who want to come here need to come LEGALLY!
It is so disgusting and embarrassing that the USA has a PROPAGANDA STATION! Who pays for this PROPAGANDA STATION? Who pays the daughter in law's salary?
It is so upsetting to me. I hear the stories of these people WHO ARE NOT getting PAID!! There are thousands and thousands of people who's health and lives are in danger because of this. One man has MS but he cannot get is medications now because he lost his insurance and cannot pay the normal price. A woman who works for TSA has breast cancer and is trying to decide if you should pay her mortgage or have her chemo. This is an outrage !!
It is time Nancy's emotional and mental stability is challenged to continue on as Speaker of the House.  She is gone at this point....and hurting this country and herself.&u%ting this country
It is time to TAKE ACTION Mr. President.  Take to Twitter later.
It makes me sad as an older American that can see our great country drug down the tubes, and to See all The happy face emoticons!üá∫üá∏üôè‚ô•Ô∏è
It should be illegal for democrats in congress to hold the country hostage like this. What if this fight were about gun ownership rights. Stand your ground POTUS. Pelosi will not pass anything and it is making her look worse and worse. Its clear Trump is trying and she is not. Its on her.
It was gross seeing NANCY put out a screw you letter to DACA AGAIN and the workers BEFORE you ever spoke... but this is what the next two years will be like. Total obstruction at the expense of Americans.
It was the Republicans that voted in womens right to vote. Like the blacks the dems fought to keep blacks and women from rights and voting.  Please spread this information.
It was their money... idiot!! Do some research before you open your dumb trap you call a mouth
It will have to go through the courts! That will take forever! What about the people who are not receiving a paycheck???? THEY ARE AMERICANS and they are sick of being held hostage for a Vanity Wall!!!
It will not do any good to tell Nancy any thing because she does not care what the American people want.  More than likely she has illegals working her vineyards.
It won't fix anything at all. Doesn't matter how long it takes you morons to work it out :D
It wouldn't slow it down anywhere near 90%. For a start your border agents are obviously corrupt since there's such a high influx already and it can't all be brought in via the CIA
It's NOT an Executive Order! It's a National Emergency,  BIG DIFFERENCE!!!
It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
It's amazing how these democratic leaders care more about illegals than they do the American people. They're argument is also hypocritical, they think it's not right to have a wall to try and protect our country, but they all live in gated communties to try and protect they're homes!
It's an emergency now the radicals in the democrat party are part of the mad Merkel obama un migrants pact to no sovereignty and one human world run by the %1
It's because she can't wash away their blood in her hands and very obvious, she has no plan to stop  the illegal aliens from coming into the USA to prevent the same crimes that were committed by these aliens against peaceful American families. It is a Deplorable act of a so-called lawmaker and speaker of Congress. She is not a real speaker for the People of this country. she is a speaker for illegal aliens and criminals getting into the country and providing them safe havens and money.
It's both parties
It's horrible what has happened  to these families but more Americans  have killed fellow Americans the illegal immigrants have.
It's more likely a trump Supporter would be part of a horrible crime like this
It's probably from your lack of education.
It's really a #Shumershutdown
It's time for American people to pull Nancy and Chuck out of their "Rat holes" to do what taxpayers have been paying them to do. People are power, they are our servers. We all should stand behind our President Donald Trump and raise our voices to demand Nancy Pelosi to BUILD THE WALL with any cost from our tax dollars or step down. We don't need a Speaker who act and behave against American people. The Rats should get over the fact that President Donald J Trump is their President, stop playing political games that only TRAITORS do. Trump 2020üá±üá∑
It's why we voted for him to be our President
Its Don who is Vlads useful idiot..not the USA
Its good no think he Indian view this these Indians are real black eyeonthese all setelite
Its like they think they're punishing us by cutting off our supply of stupidity John? hahaha
Its not just Trump keeping the government shut down. The democrats own this just as much as he does.
It‚Äôs Sunday and you are still working.  Love you and so appreciative of the hard work you are doing for us and your country!!!  God bless you immensely ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs easier to tell Trump to end shutdown than to stand up to Tyranny and Tyrants. Get a backbone people. Our forefathers went through far worse to give us this country and you don‚Äôt want to be inconvenienced. Pack your kids lunches. Use your credit cards, do whatever it takes but don‚Äôt give in. Push on Trump. From a Federal Workers Family
It‚Äôs not a crisis.  President Reagan implored Gorbachev to ‚Äú tear down this wall.‚Äù   No to building communist walls.
It‚Äôs ok trump does this omg stfu weirdo you threatened people on here I did not
It‚Äôs pretty shameful that the dems were calling for more border control when they had a president in the White House , but now they are so butt-hurt that they lost, they don‚Äôt care about anything except going against what our current president asks for. Even at the cost of our own people. When does it stop?  These people need term limits. They‚Äôve  had too much power for far too long.
It‚Äôs there jobs and the RNC to start making that known to the American public. This is the type of thing that Sarah Sanders should highlight during WH Briefings.
It‚Äôs time for Pelosi to go. The women is off her rocker. I truly don‚Äôt understand how anyone can take her serious or back her.
I‚Äôd vote for you all over again! #America
I‚Äôm American. I need the wall. I vote for President Trump 2020 for sure!!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
I‚Äôm Vladimir Putin and I approve this message.
I‚Äôm afraid Mr Trump your fighting a losing battle now that the liberals have the Muslims involved we Republicans are so outnumbered...
I‚Äôm amazed that anyone would dessagree to spend money on anything that makes our country more secure. I guess the Dems don‚Äôt lock the doors in their homes?
I‚Äôm behind you don‚Äôt back down Trump it has to stop and you are the man to do it.
I‚Äôm currently watching a tv show called  border force America‚Äôs gate keepers. You should be ashamed as you are locking up unaccompanied children crossing the border from Mexico, I understand that you don‚Äôt want or need drugs and weapons crossing the border, but these are innocent children, and you decide to lock them up. Shame on you trump üò°  You are the most corrupt person currently on this planet, you need to be taken out of your position, and very soon
I‚Äôm do not understand,will TPS have the permit to work after September this year?
I‚Äôm glad Nancy is big boss lady mr trump ,
I‚Äôm grateful the our President is standing our ground!  Our Country is more important.. Patriots know the paychecks are being held up by Dems just to spite our President and keep him from keeping his promise to us!   Pelosi was just getting ready to leave the Country for a family vacation on your dime!  All the while people aren‚Äôt getting paid!   Build the Wall Now!
I‚Äôm guessing none of you are government employees not getting paid
I‚Äôm just curious.  Would a wall have stopped the criminal gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, from fighting? (No) https://youtu.be/uVspqShcXSA
I‚Äôm on your side. We need the wall! Build the wall!!
I‚Äôm proud that you are my president what a great promise you made to these people and to us your base now stand strong against Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and the rest of the demo Kratz don‚Äôt give in change the system right now and this with a victory for the good guys just for Once
I‚Äôm sorry to say this man we have running our Country is unfit and need to be impeached the role of the president is to do the best for our country and at this point this man is clearly in this for himself and that‚Äôs it #impeachpresident45
I‚Äôm telling you I do not want a wall.  It‚Äôs antiquated and shows stuck, uninformed thinking.  Have your minions do some research on what will help the immigration problem.
JM McCormack. Were you born this stupid or is it a residual effect of being a trumpanzee?   Democrats aren't nearly as stupid as Trump's base. We know how bad of a deal that is.   Your "leader" is trapped in a situation he created. Enjoy.

Jack Moreland why would you say that?
Jackie King God, apparently, has lost his mind.
Jacqueline George , I‚Äôm sure you are aware of our 60 Billion + dollar trade deficit with Mexico each year.  What if President Trump made an agreement with Mexico to lower tariffs for US goods shipped there? Saving America that 60 Billion? That‚Äôs taking 60 Billion a year, away from Mexico, and giving it back to America.   Well, he did sign an agreement with Mexico to do just that.   That‚Äôs how Mexico is paying for the wall.
Jajaja why is you brain in ur ass!!!
James Ahssanipoor  How come you never answered my question in my comment. It's such a simple question. Stop sidestepping it. Who'd ya vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? Did you like where this country was heading? Men using the bathroom with your wife and daughter? Which Obama accomplishments do you consider to be his best?  I'm curious. Hillary would have continued down the same roads, but I'll ask the question again. Who'd ya vote for and why? Surely you have a reason?
James Ahssanipoor  I was talking about Hillary Clinton's records that were stored on a private server in her basement. Try to keep up. You're a CFO. You should pay more attention to detail... You know...the ones that were on all those smashed e-mail servers? But we all know those 33,000 deleted e-mails that would incriminate her was only an accident.  I mean..... that kind of stuff is ALWAYS happening to folks. Right? Geeeeezzzzzaloo.. to be CFO and NEVER work, you sure come up with some goofball comments! Just sayin....
James Ahssanipoor  STILL circling the airport. You said who cares about Hillary. That's something we agree on. I didn't want her back in the white house either. That's why I voted for Trump. So I'm gonna ask another time. Who did you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? It's such a simple question. How come you're not willing to answer the question? A smart CFO like yourself shouldn't have a bit of problem coming up with a very quick answer. How come it's taking so long....you never answered my question?
James Ahssanipoor  When are you going to stop circling the airport and land the plane? I've asked you a VERY simple question 3 times. I'll ask it again. Who did you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why? Your CFO of your company. Surely it ain't gonna be that hard for you to answer. So stop sidestepping it. Ya want to stop circling the airport and bring it in for a landing? Who'd you vote for in the 2016 Presidential election and why?

Janey Renteria you need to review the law. Commander in Chief means exactly that. He is responsible for protecting this country, not the House or the Senate. Children are wrongly being used by the migrants to gain entry into this country. Our laws are outdated, and this requires action to secure our borders.

Jason Terruso Donny is sealing his fate as a one-term president!  Bwahahahahaha!!  Talk about obvious statements...EVERYONE agrees we need border security.  What we don‚Äôt need is his cost-ineffective wall.  Donny needs to agree to the bipartisan deal already passed by Congress so his shutdown does not completely destroy our economy.  Just give it up now and reopen our government!!!  Trump doubles down on border wall, as polls show voters turning against his shutdown strategy...  https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doubles-down-on-border-wall-as-polls-show-voters-turning-against-his-shutdown-strategy
Jason Terruso On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  ‚ÄúThere is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
Jason Terruso simple concept:  open govt, then get TAX PAYER $ (not Mexican cash like he said!) to build wall $. What a great negotiator! Fake!

Jeff Tucker I know quite a few federal employees and they stand with the President. They know he is trying to negotiate a deal while Democrats flit around the world on our tax dollar refusing to even sit down with the President. The banks are working with federal employees and they will be payed back.

Jerri Wilcox, you keep talking about open borders, give us all a break! No one is asking for open borders? The mojority are asking for secure borders but with modern technology not an out dated wall that doesn‚Äôt work!
Jerry Matthews Smith I am gonna take that as a no since you did it not once but twice. How about throwing some of those facts you claim you know. PS I have read both. First one is good but that second one needs work or at the very least I have found that the majority of reader should at least consider finishing the book. it has 2 parts and some of these folks seem focused on the first one like they have never even read the second half.
Jerry Matthews Smith Socialized medicine is a failure? You probably don't want socialized fire or safety protection either. Are you an Anarchist?
Jerry Matthews Smith thank you for proving my point!!!!
Jerry Matthews Smith there is no one more misinformed than a trump troll.
Jerry Matthews Smith were you not capable of arguing Ryan's comment on what he said?
Jerry Matthews Smith working backwards isn‚Äôt an accomplishment.

Jerry Wilcox 60% plus Americans don‚Äôt want a wall from sea to shining sea!  What the mojority of Americans want is secure borders! We want modern technology, the same technology that the criminals are using! If we dont step up to the plate and modernize how we secure our borders the drug cartels and the few illegals that try will breach the outdated wall. Please remember walls can be tunneled under, climbed over and in some cases through the walls themselves! Let‚Äôs use our heads please!
Jerry Wilcox He is a minority elected President - so his campaign promise is in the minority as far as approval.
Jerry Wilcox can you send us something to back up your lie? He wants a wall from sea to shining sea? That‚Äôs a wall, dumb dumb!

Jim Crowell because he doesn‚Äôt care about us
Jim Damico so we are talking about STD's now
Jim Lackey  not me how about you?
Jim Lackey not at all, but trump is a nasty asshole who cares less about anyone other than himself
Jim MacKey 63 million people elected Trump. We ALL own this shutdown together with him. The same 63 million want the wall built. Most of us are not effected by the shut down. And in fact, would like all non essential government employees fired! It‚Äôs probable more than 63 million since democrats are leaving the party in droves.
Jim MacKey A lot of those children come over unaccompanied or with people not even related, hence child traffickers.  They are not in Internment camps more like encampments, meaning they are in a place with temporary accommodations. SMH
Jim MacKey Ha because I had a great job and career with the government, it was a non issue, we got paid just like these folks will.  When you were laid off did you get back paid?  did you get free food and other support?  If so, great right?
Jim MacKey LOL I am very real thank you, I have been furloughed at least a couple of times.  The reality is these folks are getting free food and many resources not afforded to private sectors that get laid off, PLUS they WILL be paid.
Jim MacKey and it takes a heartless person to want ONE more Angel Mom added to the list, knowing these 800,000 people will be paid.
Jim MacKey right Mitch won‚Äôt let them vote because he knows they will pass the bill without funding baby boys waaaaaaaaaaaaal - it is disgusting what they are letting donald get away with
Jim MacKey what a stupid statement, he is already showing compassion. Pelosi wont even meet with the Angel Moms, SMH
Jim MacKey yep couple times lol
Jim MacKey yes lol
Jim MacKey you mean like Pelosi not meeting with the Angel Moms?

Jim Winston Smith Cornbrooks lol. Here we go again. Just because I don't care for Chump that auto means I voted for Obama? By the way, when are we gonna get over Obama and Hillary? Come on people its been over 2 yrs now. I'm out gezzz

Jody Barbian Regner build it thru your house
Jody Barbian Regner u understand most of the land for the wall is on private property...which means he wants to take there land........would you allow it
Joe Calabrese I've gone many months without pay. I have a lot of empathy for the victims of illegal immigrants. I also realize that our arguing here on Facebook won't change either of our minds, so don't bother.
Joe Calabrese no when dems do the right thing all they got do is give up money for the wall and it's over balls in their court
Joe Calabrese when Pelosi gets over herself and does the right thing! She doesn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about these workers going without a paycheck when she was ready to fly off for a week!! No chance to work this mess out because she doesn‚Äôt care about anything other than getting her way! She has some grandiose idea she‚Äôs in charge üòÇüòÇ She is the culprit in this shutdown and she is the solution!!

John DiGaetano ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èthe only reason trump changed his mind about signing the agreement was because Coulter yelled at him- How can you possibly believe that trump would fight for anything?
John King yes! Let's start with Mar A Lago. There's a host of illegals working there.
John Loew, what a weak half a century narrative. Your rear view mirror must be very large
John R. Harvey I agree. More illegals on their way. Enough talking. Close the border President Donald J. Trump.
John R. Harvey there is no crisis- donald is lying as usual  - On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  ‚ÄúThere is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
John Sindall or they would have committed ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù
John Wheeler  Well John, the answer is simple. Nancy and Chuck can allow $5.7 billion for our security wall, which is peanuts, and everybody immediately goes back to work.  Or....the Democrats continue to allow open borders in order to harvest votes from hundreds of thousands, even millions eventually, of illegal non citizens from several South American countries. This practice was unheard of and a crime around 10 years ago.
John Wheeler , hey you, that hangs on Radical liberals such as Pelosi and Schumer.
John Wheeler ---YOU ARE RIGHT---Tell Scummer and Pelousy to stop punishing The US  for their Trump hate---signed a 47 year DEMOCRAT !!
John Wheeler ... well, by you not liking trump yet following him on Facebook  has accomplished something... We all now know that you're an idiot....
John Wheeler But trying to reopen the Government is,  but looks to be an impossible task with half of the lawmakers refusing to talk and as usual showing that the American people are not their main concern,  they say how bad they feel for all those people who , and with the next breath they show them that they still care more about those new voters that they need to get into the Country. In the end those eight hundred thousand furloughed workers their  families and friends will decide who to hold responsible for this shutdown. I doubt they are all sitting around the kitchen table cheering the fact the the Democrats refuse to even discuss any kind of compromise,  they can plainly see that the President is trying, can‚Äôt imagine that they are sending messages to Pelosi letting her know that it‚Äôs ok hold your ground, it‚Äôs ok the kids ate yesterday, they will make it for a couple of more days, the electric company probably won‚Äôt turn off the power during the coldest weather we have had so far,  our neighborhood brought a couple of gallons of gas for the car just Incase we have an emergency. So yes Nancy stay strong take care of your special projects , get your votes , the American people are have had years of The Democrats putting them last so carry on.
John Wheeler Nancy
John Wheeler but do you know how many illegal s are getting paid with our tax dollars? And Pelosi is keeping it shutdown not Trump he wants it open.
John Wheeler how about thinking about the millions of American citizens who are disabled, seniors and vets who get little to no help over illegals?
John Wheeler it could have easily been reopen if Pelosi would have come to the table
John Wheeler that‚Äôs all on Nancy now.
John Wheeler that‚Äôs only because your not an American
John Wheeler they will all get back pay so its like a paid vacation! Quit your whining! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
John Wheeler what do you want him to do give in get no border protection allow the illegal aliens to do what they want ? Do you realize how much it costs us now to care for those lazy selfish illegals that look for a free ride everywhere the go?  Do you realize that for every one of the illegals that are trying to make a better place for themselves, the cost they cause the guy or gal that has a legal right to be here a job health care food and housing? What party of illegal is wrong don‚Äôt you get?
John Wheeler yeah agree...Tell Chuckie n Peelousey to get their asses to the table!
John Wheeler, Democrats need to act
John.I probably saw more war in London As  kid.than you might have seen.And my father was killed in Burma in 44. MY mother lost everything she owned in London Bombing.SO STFU ,and don't be a crotch groper endorser,And incidently John.WHY were we in Viet Nam.?

Joseph R Phipps The President has repeatedly used faulty data to invent national security justifications for flawed policy, including the Muslim Ban. In compliance with the President‚Äôs March 2017 executive order halting travel from six majority-Muslim countries, the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) issued a report, rife with inaccuracies and methodological flaws, to create evidence justifying the ban by framing foreign-born people ‚Äî including American citizens ‚Äî as a ‚Äúserious and persistent terror threat.

Joseph R Phipps and sound dumb to everyone uve spoken too
Joseph R Phipps and you were the one riding the yellow short bus with long thin hair
Joseph R Phipps but Obama had 8 years and he is friends with the Bushes now. You think any ex president would ever be friends with traitor Trump? I think that's a hard no. Thank god there's no chance in hell we will have 8 years with this chump. We might not even have 4 years with the way he's going!
Joseph R Phipps do you happen to know where I can donate to the Trump foundation?  Also Im thinking of going to Trump University. Do you know if it's a good school? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Joseph R Phipps first off he's not "my boy." I don't blindly support politicians like you Trumpers do. I criticized Obama plenty.  Russia is interfering in our elections as we speak. They have even hacked into our electrical grids ECT. So I don't know if Putin has a tape of Trump peeing on underage hookers or what. Russia is not our ally.  Sorry but Mueller is VERY busy with Trumps crimes. Is it even possible for you to debate without bringing up past presidents? Who by the way aren't under investigation.
Joseph R Phipps he did bring him up at the very beginning. And he had every right to as Bush left us in one of our worst recessions in history. 2 years in and Trump continues to talk about Obama and even Hillary who lost the election. He's a whiny little bitch.
Joseph R Phipps hold up Repuppetüë∫ Those failures belong to the trumpster lol... Where are all these great numbers Trump proclaimed? No one ever sees them but him

Joseph R Phipps lies
Joseph R Phipps lies lol. Do you pull these comments out of a hat
Joseph R Phipps no Manafort did things on the campaign as well. Probably at the direction of Trump. He's a very crooked man. You think he was clean and good while runing another criminals campaign. Have you seen his court documents. Hundreds of redactions. Hmmmm....probably nothing to do with your god Trump.  You claim all these things but don't back them up with any sources which leads me to believe you get these tidbits from some crazy conspiracy news. You might want to see a psychatrist for your obsession with Obama. Your constant deflections are getting old.
Joseph R Phipps none
Joseph R Phipps now how many laws that Trump broken OR been accused of?   Obama -0
Joseph R Phipps oh god don't even start. Obama is gone now. And all you people do is deflect to him and Hillary. Its getting old and sad.  Do you even have a clue what Trump is doing to the environment. Maybe ask a family that lives near a structure that is back polluting again because of him.  Obama did not have the longest job loss streak ever. You sound like Trump just spouting nonsense. Its pathetic.
Joseph R Phipps people don't claim that. He did inherit a good economy but look what he's doing to it. Mr. Man of the People giving bigly tax breaks to the ultra wealthy. Now he's costing us billions with his stupid distraction shut down. He's adding astronomical debt. Didn't he promise to eliminate the debt? Oh right...he's a liar. Trump will most likely leave us in a recession. Too bad we won't have Obama to get us out of it.
Joseph R Phipps trump been on  investigation for awhile. Everyone around him is keeping him safe FOR NOW.  Why didn't he let any of his team members in the room when he met with Putin?
Joseph R Phipps what happened to the Republicans being the party of law and order?? The party of values??
Joseph R Phipps yea and your president wants to build a wall thru San AntonioüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ

Use the foreign aid money we would be sending to them to build the wall mile by mile until it‚Äôs done!
Just a Suggestion:  End the government shutdown by following this procedure and timeline:  1.  Give the President and Congress 5 days to come to an agreement.     a.  If agreement is reached, open up the government.     b.  If no agreement is reached:         1.   The government will immediately re-open based on 2018 spending levels.         2.    The 4 leaders of Congress (2 Republicans + 2 Democrats) will appoint 2 joint committees.                 The committees may include members of all parties or may be partisan.                 a.  The first committee will be appointed by the two Democratic leaders to establish legislation                          on DACA (up to including a path to citizenship).                         1.  The committee will consist of 3 Representatives and 2 Senators.                 b.  The second committee will be appointed by the two Republican leaders to establish legislation                         on border security (to include up to $5.7 billion on a wall/fence).                         1.    The committee wil consist of 3 Representatives and 2 Senators.             3.  Both Committees will have 5 days to establish legislation.         4.  Congress and the President will approve both pieces of legislation as they are written by the              respective committees without further discussion, within 2 days of the legislation being presented.  Advantages of this procedure: 1.  Takes egos out of the process within 5 days. 2.  Maximum of 12 more days of shutdown. 3.  Resolves 2 contentious issues 4.  Eveyone gets what they want. 5.  No one is completely happy. 6.  We can all get on with our lives.
Just a thought how about putting the hurting where it belongs.  Of the 800,000 not getting a paycheck during the Government shutdown.  How about the only ones who suffer are the ones making the votes.  It's not the American people sitting in those stubborn rooms of negotiations.
Just be extra careful President Trump.  The oppositions/NWO is stepping up their efforts.  Our government and other countries governments are colluding.  Please notice how the cabinet was not in country when JFK was eliminated.  Please be careful.  We need you to continue what you started.
Just build the wall and let everyone go back to work!
Just call a national emergency and end this shutdown
Just declare a National Emergency
Just do an executive order and be done with it
Just don't take their beads or blankets man...
Just go for emergency!
Just go to her FB page and comment on it!
Just have the military build the wall Mr. President. Don't compromise with the power mad sociopathic Democrat Party leadership. When we compromise with someone that is wrong? Everyone becomes mistaken.

Just like Obama did with his unaffordable healthcare act.
Just like the Orange Monster‚Äôs lie that Latinos like him, Jews should have the same concerns when embraced by the Crime Family:  ‚ÄúConservative friends, a lot of you voted for Trump because of his support for Israel.   During his presidency there have been multiple acts of terrorism against American Jews, including this latest shooting in Pittsburgh. All of these actions have been taken by far right extremists (the Pittsburgh shooter blamed Jews for assisting the migrant caravan in Mexico).   My question to you is, are you willing to accept that the rhetoric of violence and hatred that Trump embraces is, at least in part, to blame for the rise in antisemetic terror? Is your support of Israel a genuine act of solidarity with the Jewish people, or are you simply choosing a side in your greater battle against Islam? Because as someone with very recent Jewish ancestry, I can assure you that the far-right has never been a friend to the Jewish people.   American Jews stood hand in hand with African Americans in their fight for equality, American Jews are an ethnic minority STILL fighting for civil treatment in this country. 71% of American Jews voted for Hillary Clinton and an even greater number will vote against Trump in 2020.   Conservative and Republican friends, the Jews are not your allies and you have proven that with your continued support of the alt-right and Donald Trump, so please do not use them for your political agenda any longer.‚Äù - Carlos Brandon, posted October 2018

Lara and the Tone deaf tRump Crime Family Millionaires Tell the Furloughed: DONT worry, be happy! üò§ü§¨ü§Æ  A ‚ÄòLet Them Eat Cake‚Äô Shutdown  Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, gave food to furloughed government workers on Tuesday at the World Central Kitchen in Washington. While tRump‚Äôs Swamp Embarrasses Themselves  By Katie Rogers Jan. 24, 2019 WASHINGTON ‚Äî  Mr. Trump has stocked his administration with millionaires and the garden-variety wealthy who have not been as careful with their messaging, and Democrats are making the most of it.  The ripest target of partisan prey is Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who pads around Washington in $600 embroidered slippers and is known for frequenting high-end restaurants. On Thursday, he expressed confusion about why furloughed federal workers were visiting food banks.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really quite understand why‚Äù the food bank visits were happening, Mr. Ross, 81, said on CNBC. Some banks were offering interest-free loans, he said, and because the workers would eventually get their back pay, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no real reason why they shouldn‚Äôt be able to get a loan against it.‚Äù  Asked by reporters to respond to Mr. Ross‚Äôs comments, Mr. Trump said that he had not heard them, ‚Äúbut I do understand, perhaps, he should have said it differently.‚Äù He went on to suggest that ‚Äúlocal people‚Äù who operate banks and grocery stores would be understanding of people who have missed pay.  By that time, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, had already called Mr. Ross‚Äôs comments ‚Äúappalling‚Äù and further evidence of the administration‚Äôs ‚Äúcallous indifference‚Äù toward federal workers. But it was Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Mr. Trump‚Äôs most visible shutdown adversary, who invoked the French Revolution.  ‚ÄúIs this the ‚Äòlet them eat cake‚Äô kind of attitude,‚Äù Ms. Pelosi said, ‚Äúor call your father for money?‚Äù ‚Äî a reference to an earlier taunt of the president after a shutdown meeting.  Larry Kudlow, President Trump‚Äôs top economic adviser, insisted he isn‚Äôt ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù after he and other members of the administration fumbled their shutdown messaging. He also said his staff are ‚Äúworking for free‚Äù because they ‚Äúbelieve in President Trump.‚Äù   Larry Kudlow, President Trump‚Äôs top economic adviser, insisted he isn‚Äôt ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù after he and other members of the administration fumbled their shutdown messaging. He also said his staff are ‚Äúworking for free‚Äù because they ‚Äúbelieve in President Trump.‚Äù  But Mr. Ross is not the only one whose remarks required some cleanup. Lara Trump, the president‚Äôs daughter-in-law, faced days of criticism this week after an interview published Monday in which she said the shutdown amounted to ‚Äúa little bit of pain, but it‚Äôs going to be for the future of our country.‚Äù  She appeared Thursday on Fox News to say that she felt for federal workers and that her original comments were taken out of context by the ‚Äúmainstream media.‚Äù  Joining Mr. Ross and Ms. Trump on Thursday was Larry Kudlow, a top economic adviser, who turned up in the White House briefing room to tell reporters that the shutdown was ‚Äújust a glitch‚Äù and to defend how connected he was to its effects.  ‚ÄúAm I out of touch?‚Äù Mr. Kudlow said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm out of touch. I‚Äôm addressing the problem.‚Äù  Mr. Kudlow also seemed to disagree with a reporter who told him that coming to work during a shutdown was not, in fact, volunteer work because workers ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù the president.  ‚ÄúGive them credit, O.K.?‚Äù Mr. Kudlow said. ‚ÄúThey honor us by their service.‚Äù  Mr. Kudlow‚Äôs comments drew a rebuke from Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, who suggested that people in the administration meet with workers to learn firsthand of the shutdown‚Äôs effects.  ‚ÄúIf Mr. Kudlow, Mr. Ross, or literally anyone in this Administration would actually meet with federal workers and listen to their stories,‚Äù Mr. Warner said on Twitter, ‚Äúthey‚Äôd know how insulting these kinds of comments are.‚Äù  Mr. Trump, appears to be listening to the Democratic criticism but not responding to the nuances of it.  On Thursday, he appeared to be watching the news conference where Ms. Pelosi made her reference to Marie Antoinette. As she was speaking, he cherry-picked a snippet of her criticism as a real-time rebuttal for his Twitter feed ‚Äî one that seemed to miss her larger point about his administration being too out of touch to understand the problem.  Excerpted from  -NYT

Lara, I would like to thank you for reporting the "Truth News", a lot of times the truth is hard to hear however it must be heard.  It is in plain view, many things at the border have been neglected for quite some time, of course, the solutions won't come quickly, taking the first step by closing the door will stop the bleeding, so to speak with that being done, there will be a clear picture of what is broken in the system and that can be addressed  properly one problem at a time. How can we solve these major problems while living in the unresolved major issues day after day.? Some say no wall, others say yes a wall, well let me say this... if I sit at my window and look out to the road and there I see a man lying on the shoulder of the road, blood pouring from his head, what will I do?  Close the blind or pick up the phone, make the call then go tell him help is on the way. So yes I chose, I made the call, then quickly ran to him only to find it was my own brother laying there. wouldn't I be rejoicing that I did something.?  We the American people must understand that doing nothing or believing that those who have been in office all this time are telling us they are going to do this, that, or the other thing ( which they never got around to doing)  at least the President is acting on it.  Hopefully, we can all see clearly that it is time to act.  So I leave you with my thoughts and feelings wishing you all well, God Bless.!
Larry Cavanaugh, I cant agree more about the insincerity of politicians who also take great care to ensure they say as little as possible.   We talk about term limits, but for now I‚Äôd be happy if we could at least limit the terms they use.   The ironic thing is Trump is actually trying to work toward a solution while Pelosi and Schumer only seek to obstruct. Maybe Trump isn‚Äôt the bigger problem here?
Larry Cavanaugh, that‚Äôs a shame because if you think things are bad now, wait until democrats take over in 2020
Larry Cavanaugh...You were never voting for Trump anyway...take a hike, Trump already has 2020 in the bag

Larry Mitchell ??
Larry Mitchell I disagree.   If you had to pay for the costs to America from illegals, the benefits to kids born here illegally, out of pocket, followed the expenses out of your pocket, to house, feed, medical, education, incarceration of crime/gangs, etc. the fiscal big picture would be clearer.   If someone broke into your house and had a baby, made you have to legally financially support them for life, kept doing  that, against your will, in your house, what would you do to stop it?   Examine facts, like an accountant, without media propaganda. Just facts. Here's our budget. Here's our costs. How can we save money? (stop supporting illegals)   How can we stop the illegals? Fortify border security. Easier to maintain breaches, if "walk across" not happening enmass simultaneously. Triage. Stop the biggest most critical bleeder, move on to other injuries. Is logical.   You have a good point. Hope you will be able to consider another
Larry Mitchell Oh you mean like JFK did? Like Slick Willie Clinton did? And moreover that they did it while IN-OFFICE even did it in the OVAL-OFFICE?  So your standards apply to this president but none of the Liberal bastards that came before him? You people need a damn keeper!
Larry Mitchell hmmmm sounds like the clintons, obamas and the rest of the leftists you are talking about.  üòÇ
Larry Mitchell well, apparently it does by your comment. And you are wrong about them not being investigated. I read just yesterday killiary has to account for her deleted email, they want to question her again. Ohr just testified, a lot of people are nervous about that, esp. Mueller, who knew the dossier hadn't been verified yet still went ahead to obtain a warrant. Ignoring the facts as they are is typical of the left. The hatred for our President, doesn't allow anything else in those little brains of yours.
Larry Mitchell when a person doesn't have a decent argument, they resort to name calling, just like a two year old. Grow up, quit spreading rumors. And if you want to bring up him supposedly Not knowing a single bible quote, maybe you should quit being a hypocrite. Here are a couple for you. "Judge not that us be not judged". Or how about "pull out the mote that is in your own eye, before you try to pull out the mote in your brothers eye". Better yet, just shut up!
Larry Mitchell your pretty special huh ?? Nice  recap of CNN talking points ü§£..  bless your heart simpleton.

Latest Trump Approval Poll Reveals: His Base (Cult) Is Turning on Him  On Thursday,the results of a recent NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist Poll were published showing that Trump‚Äôs approval rating is currently 39 to 53 percent. This means the president‚Äôs approval rating has gone down seven points from December when it was 42 to 49 percent.
Latino support for Trump on the rise? Not so fast: PLEASE READ THIS!  BY RAUL REYES The Hill  With an odd echo of Sally Field's "You like me!" speech at the Oscars, Donald Trump on Tuesday touted findings from a poll that he viewed as showing a surge of approval from Latinos. ‚ÄúMarist/NPR/PBS Poll shows President Trump‚Äôs approval rating among Latinos going to 50%, an increase in one year of 19%. Thank you, working hard!‚Äù he Tweeted. The president also bragged on Sunday about his support from Hispanics, tweeting,‚ÄúThat is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.‚Äù  What‚Äôs wrong with this picture? Just about everything.  If you find it suspect that Hispanics would be warming to the most anti-Latino and anti-immigrant president in history ‚Äî during the government shutdown over the wall, no less ‚Äî you‚Äôre right. Trump‚Äôs reaction to this polling, as well as the poll itself, does not really reflect an accurate snapshot of Latino political views.  In his Sunday tweet, the president asserted that Hispanics ‚Äúknow the Border issue better than anyone.‚Äù This is a presumption without evidence, and may come as a surprise to the millions of assimilated, U.S.-born Latinos who do not live anywhere near our southern border. Although Latinos certainly care about immigration, immigration issues are not necessarily the same as border issues. The questions surrounding DACA and the Dreamers, for example, have little to do with the border.  With respect to the Marist poll cited by Trump, its findings about Hispanics are worthy of some skepticism. The poll was conducted in English, which suggests it may have excluded the 36 percent of U.S. Latinos who identify as Spanish-language dominant. It was conducted only in the contiguous U.S., meaning Puerto Rico was left out. Although Hispanics constitute 18 percent of the U.S. population, the poll used a data set that was 15 percent Hispanic.  Breaking the numbers down, the poll of 1,023 people included about 154 Latinos. Think about it: 154 people were used to draw conclusions about a demographic that the Census Bureau reports numbers 58.9 million. As the website Latino Rebels commented, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done Twitter polls with more respondents.‚Äù  There is nothing wrong with including a proportional representation of Latinos in a national poll. The problems arise when a small sampling of Latinos is used to extrapolate findings about the broader Hispanic population. In statistical terms, allowing 154 individuals to stand in for 58.9 million people results in a margin of error of eight percent ‚Äî a figure outside what many pollsters would consider reliable.  For what it‚Äôs worth, the same poll showed that 58 percent of Hispanics did not plan to vote for Trump, compared to 27 percent who did. Funny how the president left this finding out of his tweets.  Controversies around Latino opinion surveys are nothing new, most notably in the 2016 presidential election when Hispanic support for Trump was hotly disputed by experts. Nate Cohn pointed out that pollsters tend to sample a disproportionately Republican group of Hispanic voters, leading to results that skew right. And it is not easy to compile accurate data about Hispanics. The Latino community is diverse and surveying it requires sophisticated methodology. That‚Äôs why there are companies and organizations like Latino Decisions and the Pew Research Center devoted to this complex task. A 2018 Pew survey on the Latino community, for instance, was bilingual and used 1,501 Hispanic adults.  True, there are Latinos who support Trump, for the same reasons that other Americans do: because they are steadfast Republicans, because they admire his business background, or because they like his policies. But they are a minority among the Latino community. The best evidence we have of this can be seen in the 2018 midterm results. An estimated 69 percent of Latinos voted for the Democratic candidate, Pew reports, compared with just 29 percent who backed a Republican candidate.  Just like a majority of other Americans, a solid majority of Latinos pushed back against Trump and his policies.  In our current political climate, it‚Äôs doubtful that Trump‚Äôs approval among Latinos is soaring. While the president can still count on support from his base, it doesn‚Äôt include most Latinos ‚Äî and that is not fake news.
Laugh until you cry!
Laughable.
Laura Rodriguez he will reopen when time comes. But right now he is working on draining the swamp of corruption.
Laura Rodriguez...His approval rating from his supporters is 100%  Somebody Ms Rodriguez papers, I'm sure she's here illegally
Laurence Hyatt Thank you üòä very much!
Lauretta Webster-Hunold and bridges are socialist and schools and police forces and fire departments.
Lauri-Anne Hammond ----OH YEAH,our own Democrat party has SURE BEEN ADULT and CIVIL,HUH ???   BULLSQUAT --- dish it out,take it !!
Lawana Porter you seem to know a lot about trafficking people and drugs across the border?...luckily for you I don't jump to wild conclusions ;)
Leatha Gross - oh, that is such an old argument!  ‚ÄúHe is shutting down the government to break his signature campaign promise. His signature campaign promise was that the taxpayers weren‚Äôt going to have to pay for it.‚Äù The House Armed Services Committee Chairman said on ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù
Leatha Gross why? Did you ever even think about a southern border wall before trump told you to?
Lee Jones hahahahaha
Lee Jones hey, how many accounts do you have?  I‚Äôve noticed at least 3 with the same pics!  Guess you are a fake!
Leesa Parish Not Trump???? ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be proud to shutdown the government to get border security, Chuck‚Äù Trump‚Äôs words to Chuck Schumer in the Oval right before he shutdown the Government and put 800,000 government workers out of work for the sake of his stupid wall. So don‚Äôt tell me this is a Dem thing. I never should‚Äôve voted for this asshole, he wasn‚Äôt my choice, it was just a lack of options.
Leesa Parish You‚Äôve got that backwards.
Lena I agree with you 100%
Lena Sorrells Resnick So are you saying because I may or may Not believe in everything exactly like you, I'm not a True American? Wow what has this country come too? So üò¢
Lenny Anders That's the best comment so far. BTW it won't be the current charlatan in chief.
Lenny Anders You mean the Coast Guard?
Lenny Anders trump is trying to tote this "solution" as a cure to the problem america has with 67 billion a year in drugs or more coming over the border. He's trying to say it is going to slow illegal immigrants. It will not help. The wall in isreal did not help with terrorism it stopped regular people from crossing into their territory's. You know what did help, having America spend 38 billion on isreals military and other operations in the region. You sit there pretending you know why people stopped trying to bomb isreal its more likely because if you approach the fence and try to climb over you could be met with LETHAL force. If you intend on killing refugees and people seeking work in your country then maybe numbers will drop.
Lenny Anders yes, and it was not even read by her or the others.humm. We see the hypocrisy here daily.
Lenny couldn‚Äôt agree more.
Lenny so true
Leonar Rodriguez He is mentally sound. He is putting America first while Dems are putting illegals first. Dems just voted in two Muslims ... another Socialist... yea Dems are a party to be proud of? NO! Sad day in our country when Muslims are in our Congress and putting down our President and also Israel. God help us.
Leonar Rodriguez the entire system is jacked up
Less talk, more wall
Let America vote on the Wall... would sure save a lot of time, money and stop the financial heartache on our federal employees.  Let us make the decision.
Let Trump build the wall Nancy you unpatriotic , treasonous no good weak minded hypocrite !! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Let god
Let me say this. If I demanded that she speak with me, she does not get to refuse. We are her boss. Not the other way around. We the people tell politicians what to do. The rest of you that stand idle so not count. Ur cowards
Let them draw  unemployment  Like the rest of the real working world.
Let's not forget 3 things. 1. A bipartisan DACA deal was already on the table when he walked away from it. 2. The shutdown started under a REPUBLICAN Congress. 3. The only person keeping the government shut down right now is Mitch McConnell, who refuses to hold a vote.
Let's not forget our broken judicial system, criminals are getting away with murder and with a team of klepto serial killers. Can you believe some criminals go to jail for other criminals crimes and get released years later as planned.
Let's not forget, Daca leads to Chain Migration. No one's talking about it. I guess they think we forgot! From 2018. https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/369443-any-daca-deal-must-include-an-end-to-chain-migration

Besides your democratics voted for a 50 billion wall before Trump became President don‚Äôt you even care what happened to that money don‚Äôt you wonder how Nancy and chuck became rich while serving our country and don‚Äôt you even wonder why they want so many illegals here they are allowing the law to be broken and doesn‚Äôt it bother you that they all have walls and fences around their homes for their safety. Truth is they use the illegals to get votes once they get illegal votes they don‚Äôt really care about them either. They only care about themselves and power. Wake up js
Liam Neeson Let's put this to a national vote......would never pass.
Liar
Liar Fraud  Traitor  Thief  Criminal  Moron
Libtards and leftards are all hypocrites , assface , nearsightedness , paranoia , profit-worship , scum of the earth .
Lies and the liars that lie them.
Lies. Typo.
Like Nancy cares about what Americans want.
Like all your ancestors did Kevin?
Like always Don the Con hasnt fullu thought this through, if the borders are closed how is he and his businesses going to hire the illegals they depend on?
Like now
Liking your fingers for thier food .. and vacations da'asses
Lily-Ann Silva ...I know and it needs to stop ...tell them to get a job no more free money  ...I have worked my whole life and raised 4 kids ....let send people to school so they can support themselves  not make them dependent
Lily-Ann Silva a minor point at such a moment. I think you're on the wrong thread.
Lily-Ann Silva if you mean Donald Trump, he works on my dime. He does what I want. He's a public servant. And no, he is not allowed to be himself. We were all hoping that he would tone himself down, listen to his advisors and his generals and the people that have more experience in government than him. He could have done this right, he could have combined his knowledge of finance and their knowledge of politics, government and Military and been a good president. But no. He's got to act like a thug or a spoiled two-year-old and do all kinds of fucked up stuff AND lie every single day of his presidency. The fact that this country doesn't care that our president lies every time he opens his mouth is a disgusting situation. And it's worth being angry over. This is not what our forefathers OR the millions of people who shed their blood for our freedom had in mind. We have no allies. He's pulling us out of every single peaceful agreement that we have worked so hard to be part of and lead the world with. You better hope nobody drops a bomb on us. Nobody would come to our rescue. Not even Canada.
Linda Brown WHAT?
Linda Doiron Bailey oh sweetie I do believe she is third in the line of succession... Why are you so hateful?  Do you have any idea why trump didn‚Äôt get the funding for his stupid wall in the last two years when he had full control over congress?   Because they refused to fund it- so why did he wait until he lost the house- proudly proclaim on national Television that he would own the shutdown then the next day blame the Democrats?
Linda Doiron Bailey why do you think trump didn‚Äôt get the funding for his wall while he controlled Congress for two years? Because the Republican Congress refused to fund it!!
Linda Lopez WHAT?
Linda Marciano it's hate speak like this that proves my point... Appreciate that..now ssshhh
Linda Sarsour is a Bad Omen for America. This person is a liar, an enemy of the United States and Israel! It will have to be EXPULTED. We are afraid for your safety.  Jan 19, 2019 8:00 am By Rami Dabbas - 30 Comments  Every day more secrets are revealed about the Muslim Brotherhood and the State of Qatar, which stands behind the Muslim Brotherhood and supports it financially and morally through several tools and institutions, both inside Arab countries and in the West, especially in the United States of America, under the cover of the charities and NGO organizations located in those countries.  Linda Sarsour is an Arab American of Palestinian origin and executive director of the New York-based Arab American Society, an association that is administratively linked to the Qatar Foundation International and ideologically follows the Muslim Brotherhood and Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi ‚Äì a terror promoter ‚Äî who strongly supports the terrorist Hamas movement and the Qatari government, which is allied with adherents of political Islam. The Qatar Foundation International is closely linked to the Qatari government. Former US Treasury Department analyst Jonathan Schanzer describes the institution as ‚Äúan ATM for the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliated groups, the spiritual father of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, as well as funding Hamas and terror groups in Syria.‚Äù Schanzer stressed that Qatar‚Äôs neighbors from Arab countries were ‚Äúnauseated‚Äù by Qatar‚Äôs support for the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Qatar Foundation and the Emir of Qatar established the Al-Qaradawi Research Center in honor of Qaradawi. The purpose of the Center was to promote Al-Qaradawi‚Äôs ideas on the basis that he was a pioneer of moderate Islamic thought for Muslims today. In January 2012, the Qatar Foundation (QF) opened a center for Islamic legislation and advocacy. Tariq Ramadan, the grandson of the Brotherhood‚Äôs founder Hassan al-Banna and the son of Brotherhood leader Saeed Ramadan, was appointed as the director of research of the center.  At the same time, the Qatar Foundation has strong ties to the International Institute of Islamic Thought, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States that was investigated on terror finance issues after the 9/11 attacks. The deputy director of the Qatar Foundation for Islamic Legislation and Advocacy was Jasser Odeh. At the same time, he taught and lectured at the International Institute of Islamic Thought, as he mentioned in his own profile. The Muslim Brotherhood in the United States described the International Institute of Islamic Thought as one of ‚Äúour organizations and institutions owned by our friends‚Äù in a secret memo issued in 1991. The memo states that the purpose of its network in the United States is ‚Äúa kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destructing Western civilization from within.‚Äù  Now we come back to Linda Sarsour, who also has suspicious personal relationships. In 2004, Sarsour told the press that the US authorities questioned her and her Palestinian husband Maher Judeh, who was threatened with deportation after living in the United States for seven years. In the same interview, Sarsour mentioned that one of her cousins spent 25 years in prison in Israel, and that a family friend was sentenced to 99 years in prison. She added that her unmarried brother was also serving a 12-month sentence for being a member of Hamas.  The New York Police Department opened an investigation into the relationships of the Arab-American Association, headed by Linda Sarsour, and tried to obtain information about its board members. It found that its chairman was Dr. Ahmed Jaber, head of the Dawood mosque, known as the Islamic Mission in America. Sarsour is constantly trying to portray law enforcement officials and the government as unfair to Muslims, and her claims and fears of terrorist plots are in fact government conspiracies, according to Sarsour.  For example, Sarsour said that New York police detectives fabricated terror cases so they could get funding for the New York Police Department. The government stopped an al-Qaeda plot to destroy an aircraft using an explosive device hidden in a person‚Äôs underwear: Sarsour claimed the attacker was actually a CIA agent. In an interview, Sarsour said that ‚Äúfear of Islam‚Äù is merely a manifestation of American persecution of minorities, and the United States remains a democratic state with an authoritarian element. Sarsour is known to launch fierce attacks on Muslim Brotherhood opponents, including Muslim dissidents themselves, so the Qatar-affiliated Brotherhood put its money in the right place when it decided to invest in her organization.

Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
Lisa Jacques a lot of trump supporters do not like the truth.  Donnie is covering up his chaos and making the investigations secret so none of his base gets to see it.

Lol is DeBOREah annoyed because I blocked her? I thought she WANTED to talk about me not to me? :')

Lonny Watters We do not need slime democrats governing this nation with un-American  tactics.
Lonny Watters huh??
Lonny Watters lolololhahahaha. The majority of people I see talking Doomsday And violence seem to be Republicans. But that may also be untrue because you can't always tell.
Look at everyone selling America for their paychecks! Dear Americans and friends, I believe, I believe, Donald Trump is just an ignorant flunky for wealthy special interests in government and in health  care and  that they are bankrupting our future for their wealth. He is deceiving us with the republican Congress and protecting special interests in health care and special interests in general. They are paying lawmakers for their support and complicity. He is not helping in his terrible immigration with his super rude noise; he is hiding and protecting wealthy and selfish interests at the expense of everyone else. The swamp has given Donald Trump directions not to bother them in their money making activities and he is obedient to them and going after defenseless poor people, refugees that need mercy and a humane chance as a ruse to deceive we the people. 	We are being badly governed in his cruel immigration hoax while he is being patted on the back for deceiving the middle class and helping the wealthy lobbies. As proof I offer humble Canada and that they are not as corrupt and arrogant as our non humble elected officials.  	What is the answer but to vote these carpetbagger republicans out of office and never to support Captain Ahab again!
Look at the Commie Trumpster go.
Look at the influx coming in and we can't find jobs for our children coming out of school. Too many pushing our system and they know they can get free money if allowed to stay. Then they send it back ,tax free to their country. Bank of America and Wal-Mart helps them do it too.
Look at the laughing emoji faces on here , so funny moms & their murdered children , right?

Loren M. Slinkard WHAT?
Lori Godines so your saying people who have worked for their money can‚Äôt do what they want with it.   That is so un-American!   Lori I to believe you shouldn‚Äôt be able to cross our border at will.  I believe in border  security.  This Moron we have as a president has chosen to go about things that get people like you who are ignorant to the facts to act out like you just have.  And that is truly the problem!   Illegal immigration is a problem that is easily solved.  Make it a felony to hire anyone who isn‚Äôt here legally and illegal immigration would be solved over night.   Why isn‚Äôt this done ?   Our country would come to a screeching halt.  You may find this hard to believe, especially with your extra chromosome and all, but why isn‚Äôt it a crime to hire an illegal immigrant !!  Our food supply depends on migrant workers.   Sensible and comprehensive immigration reform is needed!   Trumps a moron and his days are numbered, so it won‚Äôt happen under his administration!

MJ  Stark  By your analogy, would you also agree to give El Chapo back 14 billion dollars since it's his ? Just wondering
MJ  Stark - Wake up, we are all forking out money for illegals everyday!  Annual cost of illegal immigration: OVER $84 BILLION. Yet Democrats will NOT spend 5 BILLION to keep Americans safe & stop drugs. Wake up Taxpayers! #BuildTheWall üá∫üá∏
MJ  Stark if it‚Äôs on the Internet it must be true üòÇ
MJ  Stark or was not their money. That money was given back to them as ransom for the Americans Iran held hostage for 444 days. Carter gave it back in the last hours of his administration.
MJ  Stark pallets of cash in the middle of the night. I get Muslim extremists don‚Äôt trust banks but I‚Äôm sure Iran would have accepted a wire transfer.
MJ  Stark, not really when it‚Äôs put into the context that despite 90% of the media coverage is negative, Trump is averaging 41% approval, which is still 4% higher than the December 2017 ratings
MJ  Stark, yes I do have a job! I have a job because of President Trump! Before all the deregulation I was unemployed for a little over a year! My last employer let 130 employees go and sent our jobs straight to Mexico. President Trump addresses everything most of us were concerned about. To top things off, my wife and I make more money than we ever have. Our standard of living has improved greatly and I am 57 years old!

Maria, you‚Äôre  not kidding,  an actual president vs. trump the commie!
Maribel Peterson no snowflake here. Stating facts.  DONALD TRUMP IS HOLDING AMERICAN'S INCOME HOSTAGE UNTIL HE gets what HE wants. I take offense to being called a snowflake, because I am fully aware of what this RUSSIAN WANNA BE dictator is doing to this country.  You can't say you care about AMERICANS AND THEN PUT OVER 80,000 PEOPLE OUT OF WORK.  FACT.

Marj Mansley Calderwood Stan is just telling the Truth.As a democrat that was not a Trump supporter, Trump has done more for our country and Gods will than any president since Kennedy who drafted me in 1963. I thank God for all those christians in those vast red states to elect president Trump.I did not like what Trump had done in his life before he bacame president either. I also would not have liked Paul, David, or Moses those awful  sinners God used to do his will.If God put Trump there, God will keep him there, even if you an I didn't like him Marj.
Marj Mansley Calderwood and you insult without contradicting anything she said. The left have no answers, all they do is attack a person for speaking up.
Marj Mansley doofus Calderwood "Dim"
Mark Oszoli No he didn‚Äôt.
Mark Storton, that‚Äôs fine as long as your quit bitching about the shutdown. Two can play your game of hardball
Mark this has nothing to do with Obama. This is about Moron Don
Marvin Shneider now that's a typical left response, attacking their appearance and trying to put down people. Why do you do that? I believe your life is so bad, you want the rest of us to be as miserable as you are. Why don't you address her comment instead of hating on her?
Mary Hillgrove thank you.    have a good day
Mary Hillgrove the majority of Americans are in support of the affordable healthcare and protested the Republicans not to take it away. The Republicans have convinced you for eight years that this was a bad insurance plan even though it was Mitt Romney's plan, a Republican.  The Republicans were in control of ALL three branches of government for two years and they could not even agree on a plan to replace it. The only legislation put forth were to give the wealthiest people richer.
Mary Shelley-Weaver no hate...I just called her a horse face....same thing Trump did to Stormy Daniels....and you have no problem with that?
Matt Williamson he went to Iraq. Remember???
Matt Williamson where were they TWO YEARS ago, a YEAR ago?

Matty Wagner yes ! ‚ÄúWe the people‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really apply ! The majority bipartisan and the majority of the population Rutgers laugh at such a stupid statement or they just ignore juvenile behavior !

Max Bassanini The New NAFA agreement will indirectly pay for the wall. Pay Attention
Max Bassanini idiot!!
Max Bassanini you pay for Nancy‚Äòs vacations and the wall around her estate
Max Bassanini you pay for abortions???
Max, you need to study up on the differences among socialism, capitalism, fascism & communism.  I recommend Ebenstein's book on the four isms.  First published in 1963.  Check Amazon.  The wall has nothing to do with socialism!
May the soul rest in peace
Maybe Angel Families could be black who see their young sons gunned down by police every week ..
Maybe Nancy we used to buy some dope from them people
Maybe they could take a trip to the border
Maybe we should stop the money we give them every year.
Maybe you had better have a look at this. You and your brilliant GOP are to blame. https://www.facebook.com/cory.wood.505/videos/2448828438465023/
Maybe you need to be careful
Maybe you tell that to members of congress, they won't negotiate...
Maybe,you should do some type of executive order and stop this type of child abuse and nonsense ongoing in this country, Some of this is involved in immigration practices so men are able to come to this country and become legal citizens.
Maybe. Trump should fine everyone who doesn't want the wall...kinda like Obama did with Obama care !!!
Me Gorbachev,tear down this wall.
Me too Carol.
Me too Mr president

Meanwhile as 45 stirs up fear w/lies his admin poisons  Us!!our land water air all for a buck.   "As the Trump administration considers weakening Obama-era safeguards for the disposal of toxic coal waste, a new report shows that groundwater near all of Texas‚Äô 16 monitored coal-fired power plants is contaminated with pollutants ‚Äî including known carcinogens such as arsenic‚Äî linked to coal ash."  "We found contamination everywhere we looked, poisoning groundwater aquifers and recreational fishing spots across the state,‚Äù said EIP attorney Abel Russ, an author of the report." https://www.texastribune.org/2019/01/17/report-texas-coal-power-plants-leaching-toxic-pollutants-groundwater/?fbclid=IwAR06ky2bd_uKPGXJ6Gk-a5to5eqsBeVwebytR_mcss366g8fyfMNLU6R9pI
Meanwhile crooked leftist medias big news was the fast-food scandal!  They know where the priority lies obviously!
Meanwhile, mainstream news outlets are not reporting that homelessness is ‚Äúexploding‚Äù out on the west coast.  For instance, we are being told that there are ‚Äú1000's of unauthorized tent camps‚Äù in the city of Seattle alone‚Ä¶  Housing prices are soaring here thanks to the tech industry, but the boom comes with a consequence: A surge in homelessness marked by 1000+ unauthorized tent camps in parks, under bridges, on freeway medians and along busy sidewalks. The liberal city is trying to figure out what to do.  But I thought that the Seattle economy was doing so well.  I guess not.  Down in San Diego, they are actually scrubbing the sidewalks with bleach because the growing homeless population is spreading hepatitis A everywhere‚Ä¶  San Diego now scrubs its sidewalks with bleach to counter a deadly hepatitis A outbreak. In Anaheim, 1000+ people sleep along a bike path in the shadow of Angel Stadium. Organizers in Portland lit incense at an outdoor food festival to cover up the stench of urine in a parking lot where vendors set up shop.  Over the past two years, ‚Äúat least 10 cities or municipal regions in California, Oregon and Washington‚Äù have declared a state of emergency because homelessness has gotten so far out of control.  Nice Job Nancy?  Lori Williams posted 1/19/2019-  We have a huge homeless population here in the Antelope Valley, California's high desert. Every under/overpass, vacant field, and any place they can pitch a tent...not to mention store fronts. They're begging in parking lots, gas stations, medians, and even coming into the business where I work. Our homeless shelter closed for lack of funds, and I won't go out after dark anymore. If they do manage to move them, hazmat has to come and clean up after them. But hey, let's allow even more people in that we can't care for, sad.  -------------------- That is all.....

Mellissa why do you pucker your mouth like that in all your photos? Just eat a lemon? From the info on your Facebook profile it appears you have a lot of personal house cleaning to do before you come on Facebook to solve America's border issues. Also, lose the arrogance. You have done nothing to earn it, "baby"
Mendoza was killed by a drunk driver as were 10,496 other people in America that year. Wouldn't banning alcohol be a better argument since in that same year only one person was killed by a drunk illegal immigrant.
Merle Kapp The laws that the republicans are not changing are letting the people that cross the boarders stay here.

Mexico and the United States share a border over 1800 miles long‚Ä¶ But their standards of living are not the same: the United States is the richest country in the world whereas half the population of Mexico is poor. 12 million Mexicans have chosen to live in America, of which 6 million are illegal immigrants. These immigrants cross the border, often risking their lives, in the hope of a better life. In fact, the American Mexican border has become one of the busiest passages for illegal immigrants in the world.  The American president Donald Trump, got elected by promising to make the United States great again. He believes a strong country is a country with closed, well guarded borders!  According to Trump, Mexicans take American jobs. And even threaten their security. He therefore promised to protect the United States by building a 1000 mile long wall along the border. But this wall raises many problems, starting with the cost: several billion dollars! Mexico feels angry and humiliated, especially as Trump wants to make Mexico pay. Opponents of the American president denounce the wall as being contrary to American values; what made it strong. A haven of refuge for migrants from everywhere.  Yes Mr. President please build that wall  Stop the illegals drugs. Stop the illegals human trafficking. Stop the illegals Aliens. Stop the killing of our Americans citizens.  Donald John Trump 2020 Then... we need a woman  President for 2024 Ivana Marie "Ivanka" Trump(?) Or Nikki Haley. Nimrata "Nikki" Haley(?)  Time to have a great woman as President of United States for 2024
Mexico laughed your President out the room same as every other nation he's tried pulling "America First" on. Who wants over taxed, shoddy American products anyway? Apart from Republicans that is?
Michael Angell 5.7B isnt the whole cost of it, and Trump's methods of justifying (the ways he says it will get paid for) are ridiculous.

Mich√®le Biwer-Erpelding That was very, very different. The immigrants that came here at that time worked 24/7 to make this Country great. The ones coming here illegally now just want hand outs and don‚Äôt want to work. You live in Germany. Why do you care when your Country has been taken over by Islam??
Mich√®le Biwer-Erpelding Who the hell are YOU to know what God is or isn‚Äôt amused by? You also don‚Äôt have the right to determine who is or isn‚Äôt a Christian. So shut your pie hole!
Mich√®le Biwer-Erpelding You‚Äôre Not even an American. WTH do you care about The Wall?
Mich√®le Biwer-Erpelding how about we start taking care of our homeless and veterans who are also living on our streets. How about you listening to all the "angel families" stories , how about you take the illegal into your home and you take care of them ?  You are so blind
Mich√®le Biwer-Erpelding if you were an American we might care what you think.
Mich√®le Biwer-Erpelding send them your address so they can come live with you, you can feed and clothe them too!

Mike J Knifong hahahahahahahshahahah.ha hahahahahahahshahahah you are citing snopes hahahahahahahshahahah.ha.
Mike J Knifong keep singing that song!  This president stayed in Washington over the holidays while his family was in Florida simply because of the shutdown. Where were your liberals? On a beach in Hawaii, Puerto Rico while federal workers in the hundreds of thousands didn‚Äôt get their check.
Mike J Knifong snopes? Really? Found to be an unreliable and biased site. The Iran nuclear deal was a horrible deal and benefits a country that supports Terrorism.
Mike J Knifong this is not a lie and believing anything snopes says is a joke. Snopes is notorious for its lies. They are a liberal site and will always call truth lies  When the owner was asked how they get their information he could not answer. That money was not Iran's. That money was given back to them as ransom when Iran held American's hostage for 444 days. Carter released that money in the final hours of his administration.  Fact. Snopes is a joke and couldn't tell the truth if their life depended on it. Obummer used taxpayer dollars to give to a terrorist nation that hates America.  He did it without congressional approval in the dead of night and with pallets of cash.
Mike J Knifong we needed 60 votes in the Senate there was only 57 votes. We did not have complete control of the House and Senate.
Mike Levin ‚Äè Verified account  @MikeLevinCA  Jan 19 More Along with my Democratic colleagues, I‚Äôve now voted NINE TIMES to re-open the govt ‚Äî while Mitch McConnell and the Senate GOP has not taken a single vote, even on bills they already passed before Trump shut things down.

Months ago, thinking that the GOP would pick up seats in the House, Trump approved $129M in funding to hire staff in the House of Rep.  He thought the funds could be used to investigate Clinton.  Democrats won and now Pelosi has this money to hire lawyers to investigate Trump!!

The newspapers added that in the past, if you wanted to become mayor of New York, you had to campaign to get closer to the Jews and get their votes, but now in a clear shift, you need to race not only to get the support of Muslims, but the voices of those with ties to Hamas, as is the case Linda Sarsour. Sarsour has also been charged with anti-Semitism because of her public pride that she has relatives who have been convicted of belonging to the terrorist Hamas movement.  Linda‚Äôs brother, Jameel Sarsour, is accused of belonging to the terrorist group Hamas and being on the terrorist list of the United States government, under the category of a ‚Äúspecialized international terrorist‚Äù by the US Treasury Department. It is strange that Jamil Sarsour lives freely in the U.S. although the government has given him this terrorist label. The FBI agents who investigated him, including FBI agent Robert Wright and retired FBI agent John Vincent, are very angry about it.  Despite this, Sarsour was a familiar face in the Obama White House. The Obama administration opened the White House to adherents of political Islam; they attended hundreds of meetings at the White House. Court documents and other records have confirmed that many of these visitors belong to groups that act as fronts for the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and other Islamic organizations. These investigations were based on a comprehensive analysis of records of visitors to the White House. These meetings were conducted with groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and other groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2013, White House officials received a delegation from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, which is now banned in Egypt and many Arab states as a terror group. It seeks to impose Sharia by force. They visited the White House. And Sarsour confirmed that she was invited to at least seven White House meetings between 2010 and 2014.  Obama is gone from the White House, but Sarsour‚Äôs continuing influence on the Left is a bad omen for America, a sign of what will happen in the future.   https://www.jihadwatch.org/.../linda-sarsour-is-a-bad...jihadwatch.org

More Americans pessimistic about Trump's presidency than any presidency in last 25 years  His strongly disapprove rating in the Marist poll, at 45% this week, tied his previous all-time high for that pollster. By the Quinnipiac University poll's reading, his strongly disapprove rating stands at 50%. These are very high strong disapproval ratings. Trump is as strongly disliked now as President Richard Nixon was when he resigned in 1974.  CNN
More BS from the Best LIAR Ever‚ùó Trump take your Medication‚ùó‚ùó

Morning Donald now support my movement BILLY G for life

Morons. Smmfh
Most Americans can't stand your stupid ass !!! Go away!! Ideot closing down government all because you want a wall... morons it's not hard to get over a wall i don't care how much security there is!
Most illegal immigration comes from people overstaying their visa.  A wall will not help that at all.  Pay our federal workers.
Most illegals don't walk across the border.  Check your facts.  Where are your billions to address the real illegal issue??????
Most of the people that are bitching about the cost of border security don‚Äôt pay taxes anyway. They either don‚Äôt work, they get everything they paid back on their tax return, or they are just low life thieves who go around stealing from others.
Most people who oppose the wall are doing so because we know it won‚Äôt work and is a waste of money. Our money. Your money. Do some research on the real reason Trump wants this wall. Never forget that wealthy people help other wealthy people and have no qualms about doing so from the sweat off your backs. Also look into our current border deterrents and the terrain over which he wants to build the wall. Please also consider that drugs are being smuggled in large shipments, by freight lines and other commercial transports that are coming through ports of entry, not in the backpacks of individuals crossing the border looking for asylum. This isn‚Äôt about left or right politics. It‚Äôs not about race (unless you make it so) for the opposers. It‚Äôs about common sense. Don‚Äôt waste my hard earned taxes on this eminent failure and symbol of hate.
Most supporters on this page are BOTS. Trump is a fraud as well.

Mr Appointed President and failed popular vote candidate ,you want to spend 5.6 Billion for a wall that is not needed while CHILDREN and FAMILIES in Flint Michigan don‚Äôt have CLEAN DRINKING WATER and need help with infrastructure,this is taxpayer money that is needed in a State for HEALTH REASONS not to SATISFY your CAMPAIGN PROMISE and EGO to build a WALL that MEXICO would PAY for, SO even if you built the wall you would STILL be a failure because MEXICO didn‚Äôt pay for it.
Mr Donald  here is a easy solution for the wall.  There is 11,000,000 plus  illegal  immigrants in USA. Give them ID, S.S# to do taxes. Permit or resident card to get a job. Good behavior  in exchange of  $3,300,000,000.00 every year. 11,000,000 immigrants  each immigrant  willing to paid $300.00 a yrs  to maintain  their papers.  11,000,000 X $300 =$3,300,000,000. Now in 10 yrs do the math.
Mr President Build that wall with or without help from congress. The only reason democrats want these illegals here is so they can fast track them to citizenship for votes..They feel a few dead Americans is colateral damage in pursute of that goal and so what..
Mr President do you need congressional permission to ‚Äúrepair‚Äù the fence ? Can you use emergency funds to ‚ÄúREPAIR‚Äù the fence and fill in the gaps ?
Mr President if Mexico is handing them over to our borders..no foreign aide??!!!! Why give them money they are part of a problem that we can‚Äôt be having..give them some when they fortify thier border and stop letting them in give them a little more..if they don‚Äôt then we don‚Äôt!! Simple quiz pro quo solution
Mr President sir.   First Love you and your family and thank you for your patriotism.     Best President we‚Äôve had.  Better than Reagan even.   If you gave the vetted dreamers a path to citizenship.   Get them a social security number and have them paying for insurance.  No more freebies.  I don‚Äôt get a Lonestar card for free groceries.  I saw a woman with $700 worth of groceries get by for $9.38.   Then she got into a brand new Ford F350. $80k truck.  They just take, take, take  With no regard for the future of the the greatest Country in the World.  USA.    Again thank you for your service
Mr President tell Nancy she is not our leader and please go ahead and build the wall.
Mr President thanks for fighting for us  https://www.facebook.com/1099736236/posts/10212947284812412/
Mr President why not put down half a billion dollars for  your wall ? You have the money and you very well know America can't afford it.
Mr President,  Our government must stop the financial incentives for illegal allieans. This will help to protect America.
Mr President,  You‚Äôve done an amazing job . But many things still need to be imploded. CAIR must be removed from these shores. They do not have any desire to coexist. Lastly, we must demand they either assimilate or leave. This religion is not one of peace. It is political ideology using a religion to slowly conquer a town, a state, a nation, the world. This is beyond debate.   Education in this country is a straight ‚Äúbuild a Marxist sheep‚Äù program at every grade level. This is by far is your most important task and perhaps longest  lasting move to ensure the radical leftist globalist never drive the country into the toilet again.   I do trust the plan. I know that where we go one we go all. However, I do believe that many American loving  patriots will totally lose faith in you and our nation if the criminals are not brought to justice in a public and big way. How are we going to prevent American Politicians of the future from becoming Clinton/Obama criminals who hate and destroy America. We must have a visual Nuremberg - A watershed moment where traitors, child killers, and their ilk meet MAGA justice.  Deep state justice is a massive part of the MAGA patriot‚Äôs expectation.  Furthermore , pedophiles and child killers should be dealt with as prescribed by the Bible. A rope, a millstone, and a body of water. Those that would harm a child deserve the darkest justice our nation can offer.  You are a master level troll. I suggest you take it up a notch. Education debt is killing this country‚Äôs college graduates. Can you imagine how a college graduate‚Äôs life might change if they were informed that their eighty thousand debt was reduced to zero? Imagine what that might do for our economy.  But there‚Äôs a catch. They must donate two thousand dollars to the building and or maintainance of our southern border wall. If a person is unable to pay that amount then they can pay monthly for five months. Finally, every person who donates to the wall gets 5‚Äùx5‚Äù sign with their name. They also rescieve a photo of their sign on the wall and its precise mile location.  Many thanks and may God continue to bless and protect you.  Sincerely,  The Garners
Mr President, I don't think a failed criminal of a coward, such as yourself, is capable of protecting me, an american citizen.  You have appointed people unqualified to positions in your government. Other positions, you've left completely vacant.  You can't embezzle money as well as your criminal father.  You can't even lie to save your presidency.  You are a coward, Mr President, and to me the name "Trump" will forever mean villany and corruption.
Mr President, I have a proposal that I think might end the shutdown. Your a billionaire Mr. President. Why don't you put up the 5.6 billion or whatever it is and if it works like you say for 1 year. You get your money back. Provided you don't get impeached in which case you would probably lose everything you've got, and go to jail anyway can so no harm no foul. What do ya say. Can we get a dealüòÅ?
Mr President, the Democrats and the liberal media are so appalled that you were elected they will stop at nothing to stop any and all of your priorities!  It‚Äôs sad but they are the elites that do not care about us the American working class.  God bless you!
Mr President. You are right. We the people totally agree and support the wall must build to protect our country and borders and USA citizens. Build the wall like North Korea and South Korea divided by triple fans with guns post. No one can in and out. Drugs dealers see the guns post. They will think twice before get in USA borders. It‚Äôs working so well in Korea. End the asylum abuser. End the welfare fund to illegal migrants. End the illegal migrants can vote. Already In USA illegal immigrants can‚Äôt get green card because they break the law. Restore 2A right.
Mr President.... What about the legal visa holders? The number of work permit isued, had reduced significantly over the years. Too many visa rejections. Please look into this matter
Mr Trump As President  you are hurting USA CITIZENS HOW YOU EXPECT THAT WE ARE WITH YOU !????  Yes the Border must be secure BUT RELEASE THE MISERY OUR PEOPLE ITS GOING TROUGH !!!!!‚Äô Remember when you used to Collect rent ???? For your family ??!? Ok this workers  too have a misery Landord that put them out !!!‚Äô You are incorrect STOP !!‚Äô
Mr Trump i have the following question: you said on your campaign that Mexico will pay the wall. But you are now asking the Congress a budget to build the wall. Why are you asking this to the Congress and not starting to charge Mexico as you said in your campaign?
Mr Trump:  What you need to do NOW is open the government and bring those workers back to work, they are being used as hostages for your agenda, & that is not fair.  How would you feel if the shutdown affected your family?  But then, it doesn't, they are going on with their lives, not missing a meal or worried about how they are going to pay their mortgages, or rent.  Meanwhile, your wife is flying to Mar Largo on government plane while TSA & ATC personnel are not working or working without pay.  Mr. Trump:  You say you are all for the American people and put Americans first, well, what about those federal employees, are they not Americans?  Think about it, do what is right!!
Mr president I greet u
Mr president even though I‚Äôm an immigrant myself ( a legal immigrant) but I totally agreed with you 100% on everything that you are doing right now for all us citizens here in the United States.  Please make America Great Again Mr. president Donald Trump!  Please keep up with your good works and screw all of the leftists and socialists!
Mr president let stop not him !!!
Mr president you got to stop this invasion from the invaders
Mr president, declare the emergency and build the wall. It won‚Äôt be political suicide. It will only strengthen your position and make the democrats think twice about not playing nice!!!
Mr. Art of the Deal walked away from 25 billion last year and now wants to beg and grovel for one fifth of that. But his sycophants lost the House so he'll have to do better than that.
Mr. Evens even though it may look like I‚Äôm implying that illegals should be shot, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm just saying that there is different avenues against illegal entry verses a wall that might not even be effective hence ‚Äútunnels‚Äù.   Ed shaeffer, Leave me tell you, I do and it‚Äôs not because I only fear ‚Äúillegals‚Äù.  Deb , agreed but what if they build tunnels what then?
Mr. President Donald J. Trump I think you should avoid any amnesty deal .  The country is already on the brink and the only thing you'll do is weaponize the illegals against America's interests.  These are the same people (who are citizens via the legal process) waving Mexican flags and voting for democrats in lopsided 80% numbers.  This IS a national security crisis!  I think every military member I know would GLADLY, FREELY take a $50 billion hit, much less a paltry $5 billion hit, to secure that border and put concrete in the ground to prevent tunneling!  So what if we have a few crumbling military buildings??  That is a cheap price to pay to block our displacement and conquest by demographics without a shot being fired
Mr. President keep up the good fight! We deserve to be safe in OUR country!
Mr. President listen to Mark Levin!  Please have him to the White House for a cup of coffee and some conversation.
Mr. President we stand behind you in this effort.  Please stop these caravans and every incentive that brings them here. Find and arrest those who are funding this attack n the United States under the guise of oppression....every country in the world has oppression and we can't fix all their problems.  We need to start helping U.S. citizens first!  So tired of our money given to sanctuary cities...abortion rights groups.....and  supporting those who come here illegally and thrust their flags and middle fingers in our faces!.   I would like to stop all aid to these countries who don't take care of their own people. Stop the anchor baby program......no other country has this! Use your executive privilege soon before it's too late. Our people need to go back to work and shouldn't suffer another day w/o paychecks.
Mr. President you have gotten the message across now call on all politicians to turn up the heat on NANCY the idiot!
Mr. President, 800,000 Federal employees and their families are being harmed by no fault of their own.  It has been 30 days or more since many of these government employees have been paid and many are required to work without pay.  That means paying for gas to go back and forth to work.  They are being held hostage in a political battle not of their making.  Many of these government employees work to secure our border, now without pay.  Please end this shutdown.  I support you on a strong border, but this is hurting our fellow Americans.
Mr. President, I have bone spurs on my feet and I served in the ArmyüòÅ. I guess besides that we really don't have much in common. Do weüòÅ? I mean you didn't serve because you have bone spurs too. I wish I would of known I would have assured with much confidence. You could've served tooüòÅ.
Mr. President, I'm an ordinary citizen residing in Houston, TX. I'm proud to have a President like you, true to your words all for the good of everyone. You have Done ENOUGH . I believe it's time you leave the job to the implementors. Stop insisting but because this provision has been approved long, long ago congress and senate should be serious that Wall issue had to be done ASAP. Let GO and MOVE on.make sure that our government employees get back to work , lift the government shutdown. We want you to keep the presidency . God bless.
Mr. President, While I agree we DO need a good wall on the Southern border to help BP, the biggest issue with immigrants living here ILLEGALLY is the VISA OVERSTAYERS, that come in & refuse to leave when their time is up, they KNOW when they get that visa that it is a TEMPORARY VISIT but our Gov't has done NOTHING to them for violating U.S. Immigration LAWS! It's been a big problem for DECADES, it's not new & STILL in 2019 thee is no solution to this?? DACA protection will NOT solve anything either! Is it ONLY for those who have it now OR would you continue to grant it to more? Reagan gave the Illegals a path to citizenship & all it did was start the massive problem we have now :( They get welfare & food stamps for the ANCHOR BABIES & some even get SSD for them, we give them FEDERAL TAX ID NUMBERS to work ILLEGALLY in the USA, many "lawmakers" have enacted "Sanctuary Cities" protecting ILLEGAL CRIMINALS, my question is WHY have OUR top Gov't officials done this to Americans? And WHERE DOES IT END? Until ALL these things are addressed & stopped, Americans will continue to suffer & be robbed while those in DC, Governors Mansions, etc. are NOT affected :( SHAME ON ALL WHO LET IT GET THIS OUT OF CONTROL!!!!!
Mr. President, declare a national emergency and let‚Äôs get this done. We support you!
Mr. President, don‚Äôt give in, build that wall. We the people are depending on you.
Mr. President, our whole church prayed for you and your family this morning.  Thank you for what you are doing for our very ungrateful nation.  You have many supporters here in Plant City and Lakeland, Florida.  We love you and uplift you in our prayers.  Keep fighting the good fight.
Mr. President, please stand firm and build the wall. Now. We need to be secure. (I live in Texas.)
Mr. President, this phony Mueller investigation is unlawful. Big Tech censoring conservative voices is unlawful.   We see thousands of conservatives taken off various platforms for "hate speech", the nature and definition of which is continually fluid and indefinable.   I don't understand why you allow all of this unlawful behavior from people who are clearly in the wrong.
Mr. President, you went on tv yesterday and attempted to negotiate the safety, security and sovereignty of the United States. These are NON-NEGOTIABLEüá∫üá∏.  BUILD THE WALL. You work for the American people, not for the "right" of illegal aliens. It was also made clear yesterday on national television that Democrat "leaders" represent the illegal aliens, not the American people. Impeach them. Furthermore, an estimated 22 million + illegal aliens are already in the United States. This proves without exception that having NO WALL DOES NOT WORK!!!  AGAIN, BUILD THE WALL. üá∫üá∏ #MAGA
Mr. President.  Declare the state of emergency!  Then, have the State of the Union address on schedule. Nancy needs a comedown!
Mr. President.....STAND TALL, UNWAVERING, just like Old Hickory many years ago, I am a proud Tennessean, I am a proud American and I am proud you are my President. STAY THE COURSE, Sir.
Mr. President...respectfully request you have the U.S.Navy SEABEES build the wall. We Can Do whatever you need. The difficult we do right away...the impossible just takes a little longer. SEABEES CAN DO!!!
Mr. President:  The demand by Democrats that you re-open the government BEFORE negotiations begin on securing the border is a TRAP!  Don't trust them, Sir.  You MUST get funding for the wall before re-opening.  The monkey is on their back, now.
Mr. President; You do not have to explain you position on the, Wall issue. That is why we elected you sir.. We know the game, we have your back. You are doing fine.
Mr. Trump Dont wait any longer to secure our border!
Mr. Trump, please know that there actually really are Federal Workers who want the barrier and understand that Nancy and Chuck are the demons here. If we don‚Äôt get our next check, it‚Äôs on batshit Nancy.
Mr. Trump, stick to your guns. don't give an inch to these anti-American socialist dems......again i say, you give an inch, they will take a mile....remember Bush senior, "read my lips, no new taxes." how did that turn out? they will do the same to me and you.
Ms Nancy is not our president...if you she don't want to help lead than let her get our of the way.
Ms. Mendozo might want to think about bringing the horror of what she and other Angel families have been put through directly. Obtain crime scene and autopsy photos of their loved ones and show those to the American people and Democrats. I know it's a terrible thing to contemplate, but maybe the stark reality of such horrors will have an impact and help put a stop to such atrocities happening to other families.
Mueller is coming for you and your family :)
My Client Resigned From the White House. It's Time for Trump to Think About His Children and Do the Same  Impeachment should be far from the President's only concern By Martin London (VP Spiro T Agnew‚Äôs attorney, back in the day)  The BuzzFeed report that former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen has told investigators that, after the election, President Trump instructed him to lie to Congress has raised new calls for impeachment. But impeachment is far from the only concern Trump should consider now.  But what is new is the BuzzFeed revelation that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has not just Cohen‚Äôs testimony but documentary evidence (the story mentions ‚Äúinternal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents‚Äù) and witness corroboration that not only the President, but others in his family ‚Äî specifically his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump, Jr. ‚Äî knew the details of Cohen‚Äôs secret dealings with Russia on behalf of Trump. Therefore, the family members knew his testimony was false and had what BuzzFeed describes as ‚Äúdeep involvement‚Äù in the discussions with Russia ‚Äî a subject they‚Äôve denied in the past. BuzzFeed writes that Cohen had ‚Äúextensive discussions‚Äù with the family members. The outlet‚Äôs two unnamed law enforcement sources said he gave them ‚Äúvery detailed updates.‚Äù If this is true, it is their criminal exposure that increases the pressure on Trump exponentially.  Trump faces two major problems: First is the question, Will Trump‚Äôs firm support in the Senate ‚Äî which is responsible for trying impeachment charges lodged by the House ‚Äî dissolve because the Senators see this as different? After all, Cohen lied directly to them. At some point, enough of them may conclude that enough is enough.  But the President‚Äôs immediate concern is Mueller. This is not like Trump firing of then‚ÄìFBI Director James Comey, which lawyers can challenge because it was technically within the President‚Äôs constitutional power to do so for any reason, good or bad. This is conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony. There can be no argument that the President has the Constitutional authority to conspire to, say, cause somebody to rob a bank ‚Äî or commit any other felony, such as giving perjurious testimony concerning the President‚Äôs conduct.  Don‚Äôt forget: While the President may be immune from prosecution while he remains in office, his children are not. Can he politically survive pardons for Donald Jr. and Ivanka? What about his son-in-law Jared? And his ex‚Äìcampaign chairman Paul Manafort? And possibly even himself? (Though this last one is probably not even legal anyway.)  As the President‚Äôs power weakens because of the shutdown, and the Mueller pressure increases, there must be some level-headed people on his team that are considering the advantages of a resignation deal, as Vice President Spiro Agnew took in 1973 when I was his lawyer ‚Äî and as I wrote the President should consider in August, if it means Mueller would end his investigation. Or failing that, even a non-deal resignation, a la Richard Nixon. Would President Mike Pence emulate President Gerald Ford and pardon his predecessor?  At some point, this for-now President must start to contemplate the future: It is not his back-slapping commentator-supporters or his Mar-a-Lago glad-handers or his Twitter followers who face a term of imprisonment. The longer the President waits, the more evidence piles up, and the tougher it will be to get a deal. Mueller already has a federal grand jury hearing evidence that just received a six-month extension. The President should make his deal before that body completes its work. The Mueller report may accompany a clutch of Mueller indictments.
My President sir, do for best, & go for best to save our life every life, Destroy criminal mafia from roots ,  first catch criminal mafia ,  send them in jail , give  them life sentence, They ruin our life every day, I speak every day any time , until they go in jail, They make any type of case whatever they want to , against any  person, Either they politician , media person, businessman or normal people,  when I comment on you sir , they make any name of account or hack accounr , & make or do any type of cooment. they hack any one's account either they president sir, or any one. sAVE our life SAVE everyone's life President sir.

My dad  may have it right. Makes sense! His comment here is from another post.  It is clear to me now that it's all about the 2020 Election.  His comment:  What the wall and sanctuary cities and states are actually about is filling the states with bodies for the 2020 census. States get representatives based on the number of people -- legal or illegal -- in their state every ten years. The more people the more seats in Congress a state has. States also get money for projects based on the census. Democrats as a whole are digging in on the immigration problem as a whole only because this year is the last year they can stack the census with bodies. Although, it doesn't hurt that they can make President Trump look bad in the process. Don't look for the Demoncrats to cave on the wall or any illegal immigration issue this year.
My grandson died may 18 18 from fentonal he was 22 year's old and will always be 22 year's old
My heart and prayers go out to all the victims! And if you think about it ,aren't all legal hard working Americans victims? They come here and abuse our law and order, our resources , our job opportunities, our taxes that should be used to benefit Americans who are struggling! They broke our laws and we are paying the price.  Build that wall!
My heart breaks for the families that lost their loved one's as the democratic party has blood on their hands for their part in refusing to fix our immigration crisis.  They've become lawless, reckless and proven too be anti-American by their actions towards us Americans. Mr. President I pray that your wisdom and strength continue to save us!
My heart breaks for these families! Build that wall. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üôèüôèüôèüôè
My heart goes out to all the family and friends of these angel mom's,  this atrocity should never have occurred in this country,  when is our government going to care about the American citizens like they care about illegal aliens?
My heart goes out to the Angel moms for the loss of their family members...regardless of the circumstances. It's a shame Trump is using their pain to further his agenda. How many of the parents whose children were killed in the last 2 years by American citizens has he met. The parents of the children in school shootings, the innocents killed by police. He had no problem parading Bill Clinton's "victims" around when it benefited his agenda..but how many real victims of sexual crimes including trafficking has he met.....how many of the families going without pay during this shutdown has he met? 800,000 plus their families are at risk...he does nothing to save them.... Failure does not look good for the leader of this country...
My heart just breaks for this lady. We need to build the wall, and I think Nancy Pelosi  is paralyzed and can't respond because her loyalty is to Soros, not America.
My household wants the wall and we want our elected officials to work for the people Not for their own agenda!
My man!!! üá∫üá∏‚úä
My neighbor was killed by a white male with an AK automatic weapon. In fact so many more have been killed with assault rifles that trump and the GOP are ignoring the REAL security crisis.
My prayers are with you all Angle moms .and dad's.
My sincere sympathy to all the families that loss their loves one because of the illegal immigrants. May God help you to endure the pain.
My son Jake pass away in 2015. He had seizures that killed him,  but it was from a drug called Death Ice too. That drug came across our borders that was part of his passing. He would of not been killed if the illegals did not bring drugs from Mexico. Please build the wall for him and all that has been killed. God bless!
My total opinion about Nancy Pelosi and why she does not want the wall is because behind the scenes I believe she's working with the drug cartels just like the other Democrats that are involved and not wanting the wall because if a wall goes up that's less money they will be receiving from the drug cartel from bringing in the drugs into our country I think she's also my opinion a part of the human trafficking that's going on in this country they don't want to give up all the illegal money blood money that they're getting off these drug cartels the people involved in the human trafficking so we'll never see the wall cuz they will fight to the end because they will be losing millions and millions of dollars every year just my opinion
NANCY ONLY HAS A GAVEL...NO HEART.
NANCY...BUILD THE WALL!!!!

Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace. She should have met with the Angel Families. Unfortunately, she doesn't care about these people or anyone else for that fact. Nancy is only interested in Nancy.
Nancy Pelosi is owned by Silicon Valley and the communist.
Nancy Pelosi is the one who should be impeached. We need to secure our borders.

Nancy Pelosi sucks
Nancy Pelosi will not meet with the Angel families that lost loved ones because of illegal immigrants because they do not fall into her delusional and misguided political agenda. It just shows how screwed up her and the democratic party are. They support illegals more than they support the American people. It is pretty pathetic.
Nancy Pelosi will prob get me investigated by fake Russian Investigation Mueller for wanting a wall!

Nancy has been in Political Office since 1976. Can't find anywhere that she has ever visited the Troops, in 43 years. Suddenly she has the Patriotic urge to pack up her entire family and go see them in a War Zone?

Nancy is a nut job lady is always against the president.
Nancy is a old hag witch who is trying to look good all she is doing is getting uglier by the day. Not talking looks here talking attitude.
Nancy is a twit. It's a shame she hates legal Americans whose taxes pay her overinflated salary. If she really feels barriers don't protect people, she should take down the fence at her house and forgo secret service detail. She's a joke!
Nancy is an enemy of the legal citizens who pay taxes.  I can‚Äôt imagine why any legal citizen would support her.  I can‚Äôt imagine why a political party could hold so much power over a legal citizen who pays taxes  to keep us safe and free.  Our political elected leaders are beholden to the people who made them very wealthy. That‚Äôs why they can‚Äôt retire.  They owe their donors for their wealth and the Wall surrounding The District of Columbia.  We are and have been fools folks.  We the People are the only ones that can change a corrupt system.  I can understand why young people are frustrated and embrace socialism. That‚Äôs the only way they can equalize the wealth in their view. In the long view Socialism fails them.  President Trump is one of the bravest men I‚Äôve known in my lifetime.  He gave up everything to expose a corrupt system that was deeply embedded in our very own Government. We can win this game folks if we put Party Politics aside and support him.
Nancy is braindead & needs replaced
Nancy is committed to the Resistance.  The Democrats will not cave on this, especially the leadership.
Nancy is not listening. And hasn‚Äôt been since 1981. She needs to be removed.
Nancy is only for Jewishh interests globally. Saudi's have ties to Israel via Zionism get 9/11 reinvestigated.
Nancy is stubborn as a mule !!!!!!
Nancy knows we want the wall..is she in charge ? Is she in the White House? No ? Then what are we waiting for ? Stop prolonging this circus of the left.Prove to the country that she is irrelevant..
Nancy needs a trip to the Mexican border so she can see for herself the terror and the sadness that danger brings crossing the border. Human & drug trafficking, pregnant women dying crossing the dessert, women getting rape by gangs , children being kidnapped or left alone in the middle of nowhere. This needs to stop not because we don't want people from South America here in the US but because it's not OK what the immigrants are going through crossing this valley of death. I'm hoping that Mexico can help his people some way or another . Mexico do your fucking job and take care your people now !!!! Trump 2020
Nancy needs those illegal immigrant democratic votes and besides, she doesnt want to return Soros money hes paid her. #BUILDTHEWALL...no deals
Nancy needs to be put to sleep old dog
Nancy needs to leave she doesn‚Äôt listen to me or you. Yes both my husband and I want the wall.
Nancy only cares about Illegals. Time for her to step down. She doesn't represent Americans
Nancy only cares about Jewishh interests globally. Israel has ties to Saudi Arabia via Zionism.
Nancy pelosi is a republican too btw so please stop calling her a democrat...... this wall showdown is just for show because it‚Äôs the only issue her and trump differ on so they‚Äôre playing it up to the max
Nancy refuses to meet with ANGEL PARENTS! THAT WALL WILL GET BUILT ONEWAY OR ANOTHER! MAGA!!!
Nancy says stick your wall up your ass
Nancy should know better...as a woman looking in these moms eyes and seeing the pain...and many more to come if we dont put up the wall stop letting more criminals in this country we have enough already
Nancy should not even be in a position to make decisions like this. Also we should vote all of these people who is holding this up just because they don't like our president out of office....ü§®üßê

Nearly 60,000 immigrants with arrest records -- including 10 accused of murder -- have been allowed to stay in the United States under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed Monday.  According to DHS, 59,786 DACA recipients have been arrested while in the U.S. -- approximately 7.8 percent of all who have been approved to remain in this country under the program since it was created in 2012. Of those, 53,792 were arrested before their most recent request for a so-called "grant of deferred action" was approved. Another 7,814 were arrested after their request was approved.

New president mexico  love socialist anty usa
News for sheep üêë
Newsflash. Illegal immigration can be solved without an expensive wall in which the money can be better used. Get tighter security, 24-hour surveillance, identify problems areas and times, and/or create a special task force designed just for that purpose. If that doesn‚Äôt work ask NASA since they figured how to fly to the moon surely this is an easy feat.  Take that money and cure cancer, improve public education, fund studies for mental health and substance abuse, or even fund St. Jude so they don‚Äôt have to beg strangers on tv.
Next Shutdown,hold congress pay. Its A Crises At The Border. Have All Dems Go And Stay By The Borders And See Whats Going On. Walk Out In The Desert. Chucky And Peloski First. Trump 2020.
Next order of business, the constitution gives power to congress to make these decisions, if he just national emergency around this then who is to say any President after him wont do this and gain more and more power. Which is part if the issue now its become so normal for people to call the president the boss, but he is only the boss of one part of a three part government.
Nice üíñ appreciate üëç üíì
Nice! God bless you President Trump!
Nick Nevels the "now" is that illegal immigrants are a problem that needs to be solved.  It's been brought up many times by many past presidents and then ignored.  This President promised to deal with the problem and is trying to do what he promised.  Elected Democrats are doing everything they can to oppose him at every turn.  They think if this lasts long enough that people who once supported Trump will get frustrated and won't support him in the next election.  Plain and simple.
Nicki Michelle, Satan isn't real either :D hahaha
Nicki Michelle, you didn't evolve at all right? Still thick as the Clay you were sculpted from by the "god" in the darkness?

Nna Emeka was born May 4th 1981 in Columbia, Missouri in America.
No
No  more  delaying  build  the  wall  now
No DACA
No DACA deals...stand your ground Mr.President.....don‚Äôt reward illegals with citizenship for breaking our laws.......if you bend on this you will cave to the dems.Build that wall without them.....everyone has a sob story so don‚Äôt listen to the propaganda from these law breaking migrants
No Daca and build that Wall!
No Daca!!!!!
No Donald, this is a phony "crisis" you created and have continually lied about. Get Mexico to pay for your imbecilic wall like you said you would. You told the Democrats that you would proudly close the government and not blame them for it. What happened to both of those things? This is your mess. You are solely to blame.
No No Nancy is letting drugs flow across the non existent safe border. Time to tell her That‚Äôs a no no!
No Trump, I‚Äôm telling YOU that I DON‚ÄôT want the wall.
No Wall
No Wall ! Not under your terms ! Stand strong Nancy !
No amnesty, no anchor babies, deportation of illegals (start with the JAILS); no CHAIN, no job visas that replace American workers, JUST NO BULL to get cheap labor !
No amnesty,no illeagles!!!!!!
No body invite them come USA that why they alive or they die is not concern America . Why they don‚Äôt come or stay mecxico because they want welfare medical do you pay tax for them
No compromises now!!!   They took a stance that they will do nothing.   Well do nothings, our President  will do what he must for our citizens.  No Daca, No Amnesty, no catch and release.   Close the Borders!!!!   üò°üò°üò°üò°
No fucking wall
No more DACA!  No more Amnesty. You promised to end ‚Äò‚Äòthis criminal illegal Obama activity too.
No more negotiating with these people. Shut the border down completely and we'll see how fast they want to come to the table.
No more negotiations with these people,,, use your presidential power and secure The boarder!!!!! Reopen the closed government shut down effective areas and get rid of pelosi and shummer!
No more putting Israeli interests first. ALLIES????
No one has fought harder for America Mr. President.
No one knows?
No one said you had to stop fighting. Just go back to fighting your family members and your subcontractors. All we ask is that you confine the damage to the few miserable people who have no choice but to deal with you. Wives, children, and people you owe money.
No one trusts you to fix anything.  Listen to the experts.  The wall would waste funds.  Pelosi made at least six better suggestions.
No one wants a damn wall we aren‚Äôt Berlin Germany
No pay for Congress!!!!  Of course, Nancy doesn't need it. She's worth over one hundred million. So what does she care?  I'll bet her mansion is surrounded by a wall (with armed guards)
No pay no wall
No thank u
No the majority of Americans want a wall. Technology so far hasn't stopped the illegal aliens. That's like someone walking into your house while you leave the door open, but the alarm system and CCTV will stop them. Dumbass
No to Donnie Trump's vanity wall! Donnie Trump sign the bipartisan legislation to reopen the government and pay our first responders their earned salaries! We know you like to walk away from responsibilities and not pay salaries to workers you owe! How many times did you declare bankruptcy and stiff employees? I think the shutdown is your way of trying to prevent congressional oversight! It's not going to work Donnie!
No to Illegal Aliens.  Yes, to the safety and security of each American Citizen and each Angel Family.  Build that WALL.
No true leader would create suffering amongst a million of their own citizens and their families in order to look like a winner or look strong.  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.  Then work with Congress to identify which border security enhancements are of highest priority, then ID what are the best approaches for those highest priority needs, then fund those approaches.  Repeat for the next highest set of priorities.  Repeat cycles until pt. of diminishing returns is encountered.  Use truth and fact - not lies and simple-minded propaganda spin messaging.   STOP hurting our own citizens - it is IMMORAL.
No wall
No wall !!!!
No wall . . . Resign petty little man.  Please for the sake of a greatful nation.
No wall Nancy no wall for this ignorant piece of üí©‚ÄºÔ∏è
No wall ever
No wall for traitor don.
No wall for you.  But be of good cheer, no one with half a mind expected you to keep your word or tell the truth.
No wall you dumb idiot
No wall you idiot. Face facts. It aint going to happen.
No wall!
No wall, EVER. Why? Because you will not be in office for long. Trump's buffoon lawyer Guiliani... "I can tell you his counsel to Michael Cohen throughout that entire period was, 'Tell the truth.' We thought he was telling the truth. I still believe he may have been telling the truth when he testified before Congress," he told host Chuck Todd. Thought they believe Cohen to be nothing but a liar?? Getting awfully difficult to keep track of all their lies! 2019 quote of year - "Impeach the motherfucker"
No wall, not necessary!!! Do your job,  fund the government. Embarrassing that you let Anne Coulter boss you around.  Who is the president, you or her?   Looks like her from where I sit.
No wall, open all the sealed files on these hypocrites and let the people see what‚Äôs been going on behind our backs. Let‚Äôs see who‚Äôs been lying, cheating, unfaithful, and on the take to amass their millions. Open it up and let the chips fall where they may. Sal
No wall. Better security measures are available. Experts tell you. You are such a stupid man.
No wall. The bigger issues are income inequality, a living wage, climate change, affordable housing, college tuition, caring for veterans, getting money out of politics, humane immigration, women‚Äôs rights, strengthen social security.
No way  to prove  it but damn
No we don't
No you didn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre the problem. You‚Äôll go down in history as a horrible experiment gone wrong
No, it's about playing for the team not the people.  Chuck and Nancy and many more Dem reps voted for 350+mi boarder wall under Obama but can't do that now because their voter base hates Trump, with a Dem as prez they would build the wall a little at a time like they have been, but stabbing DACA in the back was 100% "playing for the team".
No, she doesn't! Put down the Koolaid and PAY ATTENTION!
No, that would be 45 a very serious mental problem
No, this falls on the democrats solely.
No, we don't want your stupid wall!
No, your not a bully
No,us citizens have taxes too high now. Can't affort a wall
No.  She doesn‚Äôt have the courage to repeat her lies to them. If she did she might have to admit our President is right and she might be exposed as the hater she is. She doesn‚Äôt represent the people. She seems to have lost her moral compass, if she ever had one.
Nobody really cares who you vote for.
Nobody wants open borders, dumb ass. The crisis is fake
Nobody wants open borders, that‚Äôs just another political lie from Trump.  His ‚Äúwall‚Äù is impossible to build and will accomplish nothing, that‚Äôs the truth.  You should fear a leader willing to terrorize his own people - you may be next.
Non-negotiable. Dems don't want the wall so Israel can dump massive immigration into Mexico and the USA for their Zionist/commie NWO agenda. First job of any president is to secure safely is Trump for the USA or for Zionist Israeli interests????
Nonsensical to the issue.
Nope,being entertained by your ANONYMOUS STUPIDITY !!
Nope.  Open the government
Nope. But I will tell everyone it‚Äôs overdue for both term limits and you to step down. Way down.
Nope. That's just a nice convenient position that sound reasonable, but the hard truth and argument against that relaxed attitude is, that if that was the case, the wall could have been erected by now, based on an agreement made long ago. The socalled "gun" you so highly claim has in fact just been drawn recently.  It's a bit two-tongued...first denying making any agreement at all under any circumstances. Then denying making any agreement, because of "a gun" and claiming, that a deal could have been made if the "gun" hasn't been drawn.. Come on
Norene Boone  all well and good when we had people in the Government willing to do there job . It‚Äôs not his wall it‚Äôs the people‚Äôs wall digbat
Norene Boone  love my President WE HAVE ONE SINGLE MAN who has attempted to solve a problem that predated him being in the White House. We have one single man who fights every day for Americans against all the elite, deep state Washington insiders owned by lobbyists! Thank you President Trump
Norene Boone , it all there fault except  trump hes only  been there for two yrs. Most Congress  been there for ever and have done nothing but talk about border security
Norene Boone Funny, the Dems don't play that way.  Remember Obamacare bill Pelosi said you have to pass a bill to see what's in it as they rammed another mandatory tax down our throats. That's how the Dems legislate! Bunch of corrupt crooks!
Norene Boone Give the federal people back their pay. Instead hold all of Senators and Reps, they are the ones that are holding up the pay of USA Citizens. Bet they would come to a quicker decision.....don't you.
Norene Boone He didn‚Äôt really have a majority. He didn‚Äôt have all the Republicans either. It takes 60 % in the Senate to pass bills. He is fighting a group in Congress who want and like the way things are. They don‚Äôt want change like some people want. They want power and money. Even term limits may not stop it and most if not all of them would never vote for term limits. Call it what you want, but we have a stalemate. And we are getting nothing of value to us and or the country.  The only things we have gotten in the last two years came from Executive Order. I for one do not want a dictatorship where one person rules. I like what we should have and I think it‚Äôs worth fighting for.
Norene Boone I disagree. I want the wall.
Norene Boone I pay 740. A month and only  pays for half my medical bills no scripts no dental no vision .this needs to stop.
Norene Boone Obama care is unconstitutional cram that up your ass
Norene Boone and just how many executive orders leap frogged passed Congress by Mr I've got a pen and a phone?
Norene Boone are you going to really compare Trump to Obama? You can‚Äôt seriously believe the Republicans hated Obama more than the Democrats loathe Trump. It‚Äôs not even close...and you know it.
Norene Boone aren't those bills without the wall? I don't know about everyone, but I think we need the wall.
Norene Boone except Obama shutdown the government until Obamacare was passed.
Norene Boone except none of those Presidents had an opposing party that hated them.
Norene Boone how did that work out for Obamacare the biggest fraud on the American people? You can keep your Dr. we have to pass it to read it Pelosi!!!! Democrats are despicable people!!!!are you one too?
Norene Boone i can careless why its increasing.    I,m pissed  that  California and new york city are making a proposal to give undocumented illegal immigrants free health care. Whats your take on that
Norene Boone i have to pay 587.00 a month . Affordable  health care?  And your two Democrat  district of the state of California and new york city are making a proposal to give undocumented illegal immigrants free health care.   You and me will most likely  pay for it.   So sleep  on that.
Norene Boone not true. But CNN will keep telling you it is.
Norene Boone oh that's smart spending year's and millions on something that's been approved by them for year's. I guess democrats are ok with just wasting the money in some other country that it would take to build the wall.
Norene Boone perhaps after reading your long winded version of so called ‚Äúdue process‚Äù maybe you could get your head out of that dark space and figure out that OBVIOUSLY IT NEEDS TO BE REVAMPED
Norene Boone that‚Äôs when you drop tear gas in the tunnels then shoot when thay run out problem solved
Norene Boone the ACA was not a republican bill... gtfoh with that nonsense.
Norene Boone the Dems wouldn't for for the wall of he wanted 10 dollars to build the whole thing.
Norene Boone you are delusional
Norene Boone you are making yourself look like fool just stop!
Norene Boone you mean Barry when you are talking about THE BIGGEST TRAITOR!!!
Norene: Obama held the American's hostage for Obamacare. He then overreached his power & signed into law the DACA program which is an illegal program. Anything to do with immigration must be passed by Congress not by EO...They wouldn't pass it so he basically said "screw you I'm signing an EO for it". You asked if walls would protect someone. Do your fences protect you? Do your doors protect you? Why do you have them then if you feel these aren't protecting you? I grew up in Nogales, AZ...Believe me it is in a crisis situation.
Norman Freedman WHAT?
Northern Nevada has just recently had 4 elderly citizens murdered in their homes by an illegal immigrant.https://www.facebook.com/71346082130/posts/10155638765447131/
Not Enough. Look, Boss, I'm sorry, but, these bastards have to be deported and their enablers, the "sanctuary state" secessionists, must be vanquished.

Not happening. The US does not negotiate with terrorists, this man is holding the American people hostage and the wall is his ransom.
Not having a wall is really showing how weak and vulnerable our country is and how and where to invade our country for terrorist activity.
Not her job
Not in a million years.
Not keep the government closed
Not nearly enough shares of this post!  The MSM will not report on it.  Get the message out!!!
Not one Mexican commenting!
Not only do I want the wall built and maintained I want Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of these traitors to be removed from our congress for crimes against our country and our constitution.
Not the majority of Americans. Speak for yourself.
Nothing like stalking the Speaker of the House.
Nothing says unbiased reporting like your daughter in law reporting from the Eagles Nest- oops- I mean Trump tower
Nothing to say about those white maga boys harassing a Native American Vietnam vet ü§î any president would have immediately issued a statement condoning their actions but you won‚Äôt because deep down you were proud.
Notice how when you mention Angel Families, Democrats LAUGH. They laugh at the rape, murder, drug deaths, human trafficking and suffering of American citizens at the hands of criminal illegal aliens. Democrats are terrorists
Now damnit
Now he wants to negotiate if you would stop holding American people at hostage then maybe a lot will get done. I do admit that something has to be done with our Borders he has great ideas but he's going about it the wrong way stop holding American people hostage. In the shutdown.
Now he will want to build under ground walls !!!!!!
Now here is an idea. How about we stop handing out free health care  food stamps  and housing to the ones who come here illegally!!! I believe this would greatly reduce the flow of illegals coming here to live off the working Americam citizens.  Then maybe we can start caring for this countries homeless and hungry people.
Now some people think "Robots" can replace workers.. and they might be right.. so they may think depopulation would be ok since robots can build the products.. PROBLEM: ROBOTS WONT BUY YOUR PRODUCTS!!!!  this is flat out destruction of civilization.
Now that's real news!
Now what do you say Democrats?  How do you look at a mother and tell her her child doesn‚Äôt matter because an illegal alien killed them?  I‚Äôm waiting...

OK. Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are not going to give in, even after the offer of the DACA compromise, so now it is time. Declare the State of Emergency due to our unsecured borders. More caravans are coming. Stop this madness. We are all behind you, Mr. President. Do it now or at the State of the Union address, just do it. Our nation's security depends upon it. Build the wall!
OMG, how insanely ridiculous is it that a US president would create his own media network to spread his foul propaganda? Worse, how incredibly gullible and stupid do you have to be to fall for this crap? Good thing less than a third of the population is this ignorant. Still, that's too many.
ONE GOD + ONE PRESIDENT + ONE USA = TRUMP 2020.
ONLY SOCIALISTS BUILD WALLS.
OPEN OUR GOVERNMENT or nothing can be accomplished!       BLACKMAIL is unacceptable!
OPEN THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLES LIVES COULD BE LOST DUE TO NOT AFFORDING INSULIN AND OTHER IMPORTANT LIFESAVING MEDICATION.....
OPINION ONLY. MEDIA CORRUPTION? Let‚Äôs face it! And what to do about it?   We have a corrupt left-wing media with an agenda (to destroy our President?).  Transparency of ownership of the media is a must! NOW! We have a handful of media owners. Yes, including Newspapers (who owns yours?).   Our hometown newspapers are owned by a paltry few mostly left-wingers (Gannett?, etc. owner of USA Today+) also with an agenda hell-bent on removing President Trump?  Truth in reporting does not appear to be part of their Business Model? Monopolies?  FINANCING MODELS ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE ISSUE OF OWNERSHIP.   PUBLIC & PRIVATE ownership, the media sector‚Äôs growing reliance on non-traditional sources of revenue (i.e. not physical sales) makes it vulnerable to undue influence through new funding sources.   Whether state subsidies or private contribution, media companies‚Äô reliance on funding streams TIED TO SPECIAL INTERESTS is a real challenge to the integrity of their journalism.
ORANGE MAN BAD! #RESIST
Obama gave 150 billion dollars to HIS people of choice ( he only got elected president of the United states by the color of his skin) and this proved to be wrong for the American people. üëç
Obama had/has his own social media. Get off your high horse
Obama has a Wall and much more than that around their house.  We the Tax Payers are paying for it. https://youtu.be/tT8sNIgF1oA
Obama is gone and you're still talking about him. Its been 2 years, get over it Snowflakes
Obama shoved ACA down our throats..so you need to return the favor and build the wall..my insurance is now 2100 per month for a house hold of 2.how can anyone afford 24000 in health insurance.. it's the first time in 55 years I have not own health insurance.. and I don't even have any preexisting condition.. this is crazy.so shut the government down as long as need be.please get the health insurance under control.fire all of Congress and start over and make health insurance affordable again.. Americans have your back on this stop all the waste full spending and we the people could have a wall for sercurity and affordable health care.. please keep up the good fight.thank you Mr President..
Obama was your president
Obama's greatest achievement was when he and his man wife left the White house.
Obamacare did NOT pass like that .https://www.dailysignal.com/2010/03/16/obamacare-slaughter-rule-is-without-precedent/

Odd argument dems have about "drugs not coming on people's backs." They do come inside balloons in drug mule's stomach's. But on a larger scale they come on off road vehicles, going around check points, through the desert. It is a lot harder to do that if a 30 foot wall extends miles into the open sand. If you force them through check points with cameras and dogs or make them take long detours they are easier to catch.
Of course it would. Electronics to track the microlight and agents to intercept where it lands. Why would that not solve the problem,?
Of course she is afraid of meeting Angel parents, Pelosi doesn't care about cops or legal citizens getting killed by illegal aliens,
Of course she refused, she's afraid of the truth from these families since it doesn't fit the Democrat rhetoric.
Of course she refuses to meet with angel families, she's too worried about her safety & security!!
Of course they do Carol :D
Offer Pelosi some booze!  She‚Äôll meet then!!!!
Oh David...you are using too much logic and common sense for emotional leftist loons.

Oh gawd. Not her her again.  Just goes to show you that Trump will starve american people to get his way.  My heart goes out to her but this happens everyday by white people who drink drive and cause deaths.
Oh it was Jerry :D He's a coward and a moron :D
Oh look Propaganda Barbie is back! ROFL!
Oh poor Lara Rump. She had to get a job on Faux News.  Maybe daddy cut off Eric‚Äôs allowanceüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Oh she's blocked me as well :D
Oh shut up
Oh so much bullshit. All security agencies are working without pay to protect Americans and Trump plays political games for a wall that Mexico was promised to pay for. How many lie can a Trump supporter support? Millions because they can't read about history.
Oh stop üõë!  You are using these people!
Oh they are all weak, but Trumps the weakest
Oh yes
Oh, I am 61 now, and they were dealing with this before that.
Oh‚Ä¶ we have a broken System alright...  Youre still president
Ok And think sanction from FARMS GOD said MONEY IN EARTH MATERIAL GARDENING AND ORGANTIC HUGE SO IS VEGAN
Ok Congress you are supposed to do your job. You are risking the lively hood of Americans.  Dear President Trump I think the wrong people are having no checks. I know if you could hold the money that the senators and reps are getting instead of federal gov people, that are suffering now with no pay. Do you thing they would end this faster?     The wall is the right thing to do. You are my President and I still believe in you and our Vice President.    I think I will get a twitter acct so I can send this too you.

Ok you are good
Okay. First let me say that I voted for Trump and I support the  idea of building a border wall but, the story I just heard doesn't support the reason or need for a secure border. Drunk drivers have nothing to do with it.  Had that driver come to the United States legally, the driver probably would have been drunk regardless.   I apologize for any bed grammar, spelling, or punctuation.

Omar Martinez yes build the wall and protect Americans. By the way I‚Äôm a hispanic immigrant. Legal immigrant.
Omar Martinez yes, I want border security.....not a border wall.  I lived in El Paso for years and just moved.  There is NO CRISIS on our borders!!!!!  And you know it.  So what‚Äôs your agenda?  Just don‚Äôt want to go back to your homeland?  And you want to Not give this opportunity to ones just like you?!
Omarosa is a smart cookie. She taught us all a lot. She protected herself well by recording everything that he had to talk about. So now we are finding a lot more about him in this new day and it is not good. So I take my hat off to you Omarosa for a job well done.
On God, no contributions were received everyone, whether you all want to believe it or not. IMPORTANT.
On Judge Janine last night she show a picture of the Angel Families holding pictures of their lost loved ones as the families were trying to get in to see schumer....he refused to see them. On the other side of the tv screen there was a picture of schumer and one of his cronies holding pictures of 2 federal employees (I presume) who have been furloughed. HOW IS GODS NAME CAN HE EQUATE THE TWO LOSSES. THAT BASTARD HAS NO CONSCIENCE.  SORRY rant over..but he made my blood boil. üò°üò°üò°üò°
On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  ‚ÄúThere is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
On May 1, 1981, thousands of protesters marched in Washington to denounce President Reagan‚Äôs economic and social policies. The event was billed as ‚ÄùDays of Resistance to Roll Back Reaganism.‚Äù (Sound familiar?)ü§°
On this day in 1981, Ronald Reagan was sworn into office, so it seems appropriate to quote him"...tear down that wall!"
One day the American people will realise that the democrats hate them.
One impeachment caserole coming up.
One minute you're President says that Democrats do not want border security and then in another post he says they do want border security. https://www.facebook.com/332044727290055/posts/566355037192355/
One of the central theses of this feed has been that Trump had a legal obligation to do nothing to aid/abet Russian cybercrimes after August 17, 2016, when he received his first classified briefing as a candidate and learned of Putin's cyberwar. Today we learned he did just that.  Today we learned that Trump was discussing unilateral sanctions relief with the Kremlin (via Sessions) *and* floating the idea of a gifted $50 million penthouse in Moscow for Putin (via Cohen and Sater) *and* negotiating a massive Trump Tower Moscow deal post-August 17, 2016. The focus of the collusion conversation has always been exclusively conspiracy. In Proof of Collusion I argued that two dozen crimes could be collusive; then, once Ben Wittes said obstruction could be collusion, everyone took note. Well aiding and abetting is *also* collusion.  Remember that what we call the Trump-Rozov deal (the 2015 Trump Tower Moscow deal, as opposed to the 2013 Trump-Agalarov deal) was being negotiated *with the Kremlin*. You *cannot* learn that Putin is in a hot cyberwar with America and keep negotiating a deal with the Kremlin.  Remember that, as of August 17, 2016, Donald Trump was one of the few civilians in the *world* with a legally cognizable level of certainty that the Kremlin was engaged in a hot cyberwar against America. His obligations from then on were therefore *special* and *justiciable*. The only reason Giuliani was willing to admit today that Trump was negotiating with the Kremlin up until Election Day is that media has so doggedly (but wrongly) said that conspiracy is the only collusion charge relevant to Mueller's probe that Trump's team came to believe it.  I think the problem that we're going to have now is that media is so invested in this grave misconception of how to use the term "collusion" in discussing Mueller's work that there's a chance the full import of what Rudy confessed to today will be missed and not reported upon.  The important thing is this: if Giuliani is willing to say this publicly, it means he's either certain Mueller already has this information from another source, or sure that information at *least* this bad about the Trump-Kremlin negotiations is certain to come out eventually. when I say "today we learned" I don't actually mean "today we learned." Readers of this feed and readers of Proof of Collusion already knew about Trump's aiding and abetting. What I mean is "today all America learned."-
One problem is not telling Sen. Pelosi anything, it is getting her to listen and react as needed for the better of the country, not herself, tom
One strong woman.  Mexico will pay for the wall.  Quit being a dumbass.
Only REAL MEN admit when they're wrong. You've been played. But that's ok, we all have. The difference here is admitting when you're wrong, learning from it & moving on, right?        Be a man.
Only for 3 years!
Only if Trump is a ZIONIST
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby, Of course mama's gonna help build the wall.
Oops put
Open  the government  !
Open border field..open US citizens pockets that will pay somehow.
Open government!
Open the Government President Trump!! It is just simply inhumane .To lynchpin it on your getting your deal is unfair..and so many are suffering.It's necessary to have a great country .Thank you.
Open the Government, you greedy, selfish, childish little GOP bastards.

Open the government!!! Then do your job !!!
Open up the government

Ottavio Esquivel if the wall is built Billions of tax dollars that are spent yearly will be on the decline, the ileagals get wealfare, bring in high amounts of drug dollars, work for cash and send your tax dollars in the Billions back to their country. In a big way Mexico would be paying for the wall in the way of spending less tax dollars on them
Ottavio Esquivel... you are on the wrong page here go post to your own president in Costa Rica!
Our President is a brilliant political strategist. He just pushed the Democrats into a corner and there‚Äôs no way out for them that doesn‚Äôt end up w/ egg on their face and a big beautiful wall up on the border.
Our Sunday lesson is on Nehemiah rebuilding the wall ... Sound familiar? Read it chapter 5 an 6
Our border (the Southern one) is safe and secure. THERE IS NO BORDER CRISIS. Looks like you intend to continue to hold federal workers hostage bc you are NOT getting an insanely expensive, unnecessary and useless amount of money for that damned wall.
Our borders aren't the problem. You are.
Our borders need to be secured (Wall) & all those incentive's for Illegals to come must be removed now. Otherwise we'll find ourselves in this mess for the 3rd time. It sounds like there is 5,500 people in these 2 Caravan and another on it's way. I'm hearing more to come in Feb first wk. Congress Wake Up!! Call 1-800-350-6647 then press 1 it tells the government We want the Wall.
Our country will go to hell if we don't close our borders.  Nancy Pelosi wanted closed borders back in 2008.  She hates President Trump so much that she will fight him regardless of what he wants.  She has to go along with her gang of idiots.  She doesn't care about us, she only cares about herself and her selfish ways.  How can someone change so much?  She couldn't face the Angel families, why is she embarrassed to face them because she knows what she's doing is wrong.  She's acting like an over privileged spoiled brat.  I have NO respect for her.  She has a WALL around her home for protection, maybe we need to take her WALL down if we can't have our WALL to protect us from illegals.
Our government leaders also took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and to "well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office" that they now hold. We believe they are derelict in those duties.
Our immigration system is not broken. Enforcement of the law is what is broken. Broken by a government the is actively not supporting the security of our sovereign nation and working to created a one world government with no borders.
Our own government has always been the biggest issue with America. Its great that we have a president that will stand up to those corrupt bastards and fight for the people!
Our politicians are so insulated, To think we have millions within our borders and have no idea who or where they are. Frightening!!! We have 535 representatives(H+S) Im telling you this is nothing shy of an invasion
Our president is amazing. All that oppose him are running scared. We will prevail. We will get border security and hopefulley deport millions in the process.
Our schools in AZ have walls and locking gates around them, Elizabeth.  You are an idiot.
Our tax dollars go to fix infrastructure and walls in other countries, but not here in America.  Build the wall and fix our infrastructure.
Over 300 illegals broke into my state of AZ this week. After attempting to dig under our pathetic little wall and getting caught, the gates were thrown open for them when they asked for asylum. üòÆ This is the most messed up thing I can imagine! Trying to break in, then being allowed in when caught?! üò°
Over 63 Million Americans want the Wall!!  Has little to do with Trump personally. What is it that Pelosi and Schumer object to??  Securing our country? They look like fools! Dems even suspicious of their true motives. üíÉüá∫üá∏
Over and Over We have raised Our Voices!!..We know they are Not Listening!!!...BUT are YOU???? Mr. President????..NO DACA>>BUILD THE WALL!..Quit playing politics with them!..DECLARE THE EMERGENCY and BE DONE!!
Overheard: "The only person trump ever hired who was actually qualified to do their job was Stormy Daniels."

PELOSI will not acknowledge the ANGEL FAMILIES ,,,she has turned the demorats into a party of POISON ,,OOOPS ,,| I forgot  the corruption of Hillary Clinton started the demise of this party ,,,,, PELOSI should be sent to the BORDER on a AIR FORCE bus and dropped on the MEXICAN SIDE so she can see her manufactured crisis ,,,,,,
PIG'low,Z slabs 10% off the top from every pork barrel deal made in California & laughs all the way to her private vaults & safety deposit box .......
PLEASE BUILD THAT WALL!
PLEASE READ....VERY IMPORTANT!!!!I just saw a report from Corey Woods where illegal immigrants are filing tax claims on children who do not live here in the US. They are claiming multiple nieces and nephews that are out of the United States and have never lived here. We have to have social security numbers to claim our children. Why aren't they receiving a number for their children that they have in the United States for them to claim? Why do they not have to prove that a child lives here? The amount of money they are receiving on the child tax credit is insane and should be stopped and some kind of proof needs to be provided to show that that child lives here. üòñ
POLOSI we want the wall you dirt bag.

PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKE CONGRESS PAYCHECKS AND BUILD THE WALL THAT WOULD BE A GREAT START. THEY DON'T WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ANYWAY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: What would happen if you met with AMLO and figured out a way to Make Mexico Magnificent, giving them incentive to stay in their own country and giving immigrants from other countries an alternative to the US. I had no idea Mexico was so desperate until I read this!!! IN-FRICKIN-SANE!!!  C&P from an article, reporting the recent catastrophe,  I read this morning:  "The tragedy comes as Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador -- known as "AMLO," who took office in December -- has vowed to eradicate fuel thieves who illegally drilled taps into pipelines an estimated 12,581 times during the first 10 months of 2018, an average of about 42 violations per day.
PREZ TRUMP has shaken the foundation of the dem party.   They were always corrupt, but it was hidden from public view...and now they are exposed.   Pelosi, Schumer, Feinstein...all the long term politicians made themselves wealthy  taking from the public till.   This latest fiasco.... where Pelosi wanted to escape the WALL and make no decision.  She did what she has always done.  Too good for a commercial plane, she ordered an Air force Jet, booze and catering for all of her GUESTS.... 7 dems,  86 of their alleged relatives.. the cost to the people $200K+  for 1 week, 3 country excursion.  For the last 10 years according to the AF it has cost their budget $2.6M.   RESTITUTION............TERM LIMITS....TRUMP 2020

Pandering to spread your BS. How disgusting to use these people for your own sick agenda
Partisan people like myself can defend our party and our elected officials for their occasional missteps, but my conservative friends are finally starting to express disgust at their Republican Party and how it does not represent them or American values anymore with these scandals recently in the news:  1. The slow unfolding of the Robert Mueller investigation proving Russian assistance to the Trump campaign. 2. Maria Butina, a Russian spy who infiltrated the NRA to redirect a $30 million contribution from Russia to the Trump campaign.  3. Wisconsin and Michigan Republicans dismantling democracy as a lame-duck power because they lost an election.  4. Election fraud in North Carolina that totally eclipses anything any other group has ever done ‚Äî to the point they realize they will have to repeat the election.  5. The local Tarrant County GOP attack against one of their own Republicans for being Muslim ‚Äî totally anti-American and ignoring our Constitution.  6. The Texas GOP's attack on our LGBT citizens with ridiculous bathroom bills that are being resurrected for 2019.  To think that the biggest scandal of the Obama administration was the fake story he was born in Kenya.
Pat Shaw and why do you think it didn‚Äôt get done then?  I‚Äôm willing to bet they didn‚Äôt go with it because they figured it wouldn‚Äôt work.   The sad thing is that by trump shutting down the government it really doesn‚Äôt solve anything. The only ppl that are affected are the government employees  and not the ‚Äúillegals‚Äù.
Pat Shaw, poor thing you‚Äôre so brainwashed...
Pat Shaw, pretty sure not only to keep illegals out.
Pat Shaw, they rarely escape because of the ‚Äúarmed‚Äù guards go figure.  Lenny guidroz, is that all you could come up with who‚Äôs the ‚Äúmoron‚Äù here?
Pat Shaw, yes drugs that Americans consume and illegals that get hired by American businesses. One more thing I‚Äôm def not against helping border patrol, I‚Äôm just saying they would probably get more benefit from better technology than a wall that would probably be jumped over or dug under... Maybe you ought to click on Larry Mitchell‚Äôs link... You‚Äôre obviously not doing your research and looking at this situation from trumps point of view and not the agents...
Pat shaw, all I actually saw was wall and trump. Obviously no comprehension in all wall supporters...
Patricia Aste Trump has six more years to trigger liberals just hang in there sister.
Patricia Smith its up because Trump moved his businesses back to America from Asia. Guess what happens when he's voted out?
Patricia Watson WHAT?
Patricia why? Nobody ever wanted to do that with Bill Clinton.
Patrick Patterson you have a problem with Angel families?
Patrick Sciarratta, good for them. If opposing Trump is worth all this, then knock your socks off!
Patrick Sciarratta, it NEVER was 42-49% as an average. The highest average Trump had was 43.3% and today it‚Äôs 41.4%, or a drop of about 2% from the high, which is still within any real margin of error.  There is NO 7 point drop! Even on this one, economist has a high of 45 and even if you took his all time high of 49 would make this one a 4 point difference, not 7
Patrick Sciarratta, that is a stone cold lie. See below...  Poll	Date	Approve	Disapprove	Spread RCP Average	1/8 - 1/17	41.4	55.3	-13.9  Economist	1/12 - 1/15	45	52	-7 Rasmussen	1/15 - 1/17	44	55	-11 Reuters	1/9 - 1/15	41	55	-14 NPR/PBS/Marist	1/10 - 1/13	40	54	-14 Pew	1/9 - 1/14	39	58	-19 Quinnipiac	1/9 - 1/13	41	55	-14 CNN	1/10 - 1/11	37	57	-20 The Hill/HarrisX	1/8 - 1/11	44	56	-12 All President Trump Job Approval Polling Data  For the past year, Trump has averaged between 41-44% average approval according to RCP. That‚Äôs up from a December 2017 37% approval rating. Thanks for playing!
Patrick Sciarratta, there you go! You took a single polling entity and compared it to another single polling entity to create your skewed statistic. But if one wanted to be more ethical, they would have simply compared the average of all polling over one time period to another and saw the results. For you, it was never about being truthful, just to pervert polling to your advantage
Patrick Sciarratta, you indicated Trump is seeing a 7 point drop in about 45 or so days, which is a very misleading statistic. Polling is best extrapolated over long periods of time to obtain a true representative sample of enough data.   In December 2017, Trump had an average approval rating of 37% and it slowly increased to a high of about 43.3 in about April 2018 or so. Since that high, Trump has been his numbers fluctuate between a low of 41% to a high of nearly 44%. Statistically speaking, since the shutdown was imminent, Trump has lost about 1.3% to date   However, congress as a whole has taken a hit as well. They had an average between 19.8% to a high of about 20.7 in the same 6 - 8 month time frame as Trump. Today their approval is at 19.3, or about a loss of around 0.6 - 0.8%, or about half of Trump‚Äôs loss   But the shutdown doesn‚Äôt affect Trump nearly as bad as if he capitulated to Pelosi and Schumer. For if he did, he would lose many of his base sooner. Therefore he would have lost followers regardless. But as long as voters are lowering congress as well, at least he isn‚Äôt the only one taking a hit.
Patti Cullen ..... Its the President's number one job to protect the country from foreign invasion. He does have the authority to have the military build that wall. Maybe you should grow some common sense.
Patti Cullen go south to the border and you will see. And more are on are their way. Please dont think I am against imagination ,I have many friends  that have come to America legally and are wonderful hard working people. What  is happening at the southern border is an invasion by people that have no intention to imagrate legally. That should give us reason to be concerned for our country.!! Build the wall,technology, what ever it takes to keep us safe. It is just an older lady's opinion, not looking to cause a FB backlash

Patty Sternberg Kelly please give me some examples of what MSM has lied about.
Patty Sternberg Kelly they couldn't find anything on Obama. Obama's administration never had to show up court. No meeting with proscutors. No having to meeting with lawyers. Never had to be in court for ANYTHING lol. He did 8yrs standing on his head with no convictions. Scams.  You Repuppet thought a black couldn't be so clean.lol Way2Go Obama
Patty Sternberg Kelly where do I start??

Pay no mind to these leftist lunatics. Build that wall!
Pelosi & Schumer will never fund the a wall because "DRUG MONEY" is being funneled directly into the DNC's pockets. - -
Pelosi @SpeakerPelosi ‚Äôs Secret Overseas Mission Included 93 Family Members? Why? ‚Äì THE MARSHALL REPORT found Pelosi had all of her children & grandchildren ‚Äì 93 family members going with her on her taxpayer funded trip to Egypt, Afghanistan & Brussells?
Pelosi and Democrats should not get a paycheck until they resolve this broken issue! Bet that would be fixed quickly.
Pelosi and Schumer do not care about the peanuts the furlough workers are losing! Disgraceful!
Pelosi and Schumer won't listen to Sec Nielsen's facts, won't visit the border, won't listen to actual people that do the job, we see continued caravans that are not manufactured. Irresponsible leadership failing US citizens. Fund security wall/slats, technology, border agents, judges, beds that are needed and get people back to work.
Pelosi has Alcoholic Dementia, she needs to go to rehab!!!! That's a start to securing our borders.
Pelosi has a wall around her House
Pelosi has something going on mentally.   No excuse,  but someone needs to step in.  She has really screwed up the Democrats. FP
Pelosi has something going on mentally? ü§£ü§£ü§£ She's SMART, a quality Trumpsters don't recognize in a leader!!! ü§£
Pelosi is a coward. She doesn't care and it the left voters can't see that then they will see what trump has in store in the coming days. It should be a whopper.
Pelosi is a disgrace to our country !!!
Pelosi is a major player in the destruction of the democratic party.  They do nothing for the people and eventually the brainwashed masses we realize they have supported the wrong people for a long long time.
Pelosi is a piece of sht
Pelosi is all for Israel too and they have a wall and military protecting its borders.
Pelosi is being exposed for the obstructionist hateful person she is... Her hate for president Trump overrides any real concern she has if any... Wish we could stop paying these people
Pelosi is doing great!! Exactly what she was elected to do.
Pelosi is making money from the lobbyists paying for her obstruction of this administration and the wall. The woman is truly a disgraceful human being and a corrupt politician.
Pelosi is not going to let Trump have the wall, she's not going to negotiate. He should give her 1 more week to come to the table & if she doesn't he needs to do it on his own. DO NOT OPEN THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL WE HAVE THE WALL. NO MORE NEGOTIATION, SHE HAD MADE HER POINT, NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP NEEDS TO DO WHAT HE HAS TO WITH OUR WITHOUT HER.
Pelosi is not only bad for our country, she's a coward to boot.
Pelosi is not the President stopping treating her like one.  The people elected President Trump.  Build the WALL.
Pelosi is obviously someone that cant be dealt with. Try to do a deal behind her back with a few select democrats in states u won. If they dont want to deal just do the emergency. Run the country without her. The people can see shes just hates u n doesnt care about the country. Her only goal is to obstruct u for 2  years.
Pelosi is on her way out.. just a matter of time..
Pelosi is one sorry ass individual.  She cares about no one in this country.  Pelosi is against a wall but the first thing you notice at her house is a wall with a gate.  Trump actually cares for the American citizens, unlike that useless whore.
Pelosi is only a small part of the problem, but she reflects on what the Democratic Party has become over the years.  It is now fully infiltrated and being run by socialists and communists....she is just one of its minions!!! https://patch.com/michigan/royaloak/democratic-party-has-morphed-communist-party-socialist-party-0
Pelosi is out of touch with reality.  She must be sent for a mental evaluation.  The safety of our country is at stake.  Democrats must rebel and oust her immediately
Pelosi is owned by silicon valley, soros, left socialist wing nuts.  So sad she can't speak for her constients or we the people.
Pelosi is scared to meet them,one reason why she wants President Trump to postpone his state of the nation address.President Trump don‚Äôt let her stop you the people want to hear from you!You can deliver it anywhere we still will listen to you
Pelosi is the problem? OMG, you can't be serious.
Pelosi is the shameful one having a bay fit instead of doing her job
Pelosi is the sorriest excuse for a human being ever to walk this earth.
Pelosi is too busy trying to figure out how to fund her vacation boondoggle to Belgium, Egypt and Afghanistan, supposedly to visit the troops.  Not a lot of them in Belgium or Egypt, and a flyover of Afghanistan while she waves at the window from 35000 feet isn‚Äôt exactly a visit.
Pelosi is too scared to face the truth,,,Wimp
Pelosi needs to be tried for treason with all of her cronies...
Pelosi needs to retire! Either she is too stupid or dementia is setting in.
Pelosi needs to work on the deal
Pelosi refused to meet with Angel Family members last week.
Pelosi rejected the offer before it was even made. She's the freaking problem.  #BUILDTHEWALL  #WAKEUPAMERICA
Pelosi rich bitch
Pelosi runs away from reality.
Pelosi should do her job!
Pelosi sucks.
Pelosi thinks Israel should have a wall and a military protecting its borders but not Americans???
Pelosi wants open borders
Pelosi will continue to hide from the truth. Idiota de Californicate-ia.
Pelosi will ruin America
Pelosi üòà disgusting coward
Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the professional politicians are enemies of the United States and should be held accountable.
Pelosi, don't want the border wall, yet she has a wall around her house and a very high fence.
Pelosi, get off your azz and work out a deal with the President. You're really not worth this much headache
Pelosi-commie shill for Jewishh interests globally.
Pelosi.. We do not want any more undocumented in our country. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10158001839223776&id=644253775
Pelvis doesn't car about American family's or the people , she is a treasionest to America and should be put Out Of Office,. She has taken money under the table and sold out the American people ,. 194,000,000 mil.
People keep talking about the executive order but it isn't that easy. Even if he does it, the Dems, Nancy and Chuck will fight it and mingle with some Dem judge who will just throw it out. Trump is trying to do it the mature way hoping Nancy and Chucky will come around and come to their senses but that probably just isn't going to happen. In their eyes "Trump wins" in that case, and they just can't have that.
Percy D Garner  I have never witnessed his level of genius..What a treat!  Love watching him go and setting up that chessboard move after move!! #Winning üíÉüá∫üá∏
Perhaps the biggest diversion of all is that he is non-negotiable on funding the wall, but NOT A PENNY TO PREVENT RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN OUR ELECTIONS...
Perhaps you should Rephrase that statement to say... " I will not stop till All American's are Safe and Secure." rather than just the Freakin Boarders Donald J. Trump
Peter Daou @peterdaou  The FBI opened an investigation into whether Trump is a Russian asset.   And people still talk about his 2020 campaign. What is wrong with America?  #SundayThoughts #Mueller #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump
Petition of Remonstrance William Sharpe  Fellow Americans, 16 January 2019 The most powerful weapon that we the people have to control the government, servants of the people, is a formal petition of remonstrance. It will put the fear of God into any politician. The formal petition process to impeach and remove any public servant, elected official, appointed or the receiving of emoluments we would do through something called a petition of remonstrance. You file the petition of remonstrance with the legislators with the charges of treason against the people in whom violated the oath of office, these are impeachable offenses and these people can never hold office again. You have to remember that they have publicly stated their stance against The Constitution, a violation of their oath of office, going against the will of the people, showing disregard for our laws! We the people‚Äôs laws are that of the Constitution, The Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, these are the laws that control them and they are stating they want more power and they are not willing to comply with the terms of employment through their oath of office.  Basically these political parties corporations, religious organizations and politicians, by proxy are performing what is known as a hostile takeover in the corporate and business world or the overthrow of a particular corporation or business and in the government sector this is called a coup d‚Äô√©tat or the overthrow of the government or country or the established political will of the people. When you took your oath of office, and swore an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of The United States of America and you use the emoluments provided by the people for the sole purpose to defend that Constitution and then you pronounce to work to destroy that same constitution that you swore an oath to protect and defend, you have committed perjury and theft against the people and your oath! This is a criminal act, an impeachable offense! It shows that you have performed an immoral act in which proves you to be untrustworthy to hold that position granted to you by the people whose trust you betrayed.  This is fraud and there is no statue of limitations on fraud! You have violated the will of the people and their trust through your actions of perjury with your own lies with the sole purpose and intent to deceive, steal faith and the trust of the people. You are embezzling emoluments for your own personal, financial and political gain which is theft by design. I would also say it is a violation of your terms of employment! The Democrats work exclusively for the American Bar Association. The Bar Association works exclusively for the Roman Catholic Church/Government and Islam, and any other foreign country that is working to destroy America. They do not care about the American people. They do not work for the American people. They are liars, thieves and deceivers of the highest magnitude!  https://youtu.be/i9XZUlf0wIE?fbclid=IwAR0qvVsda5fgelTJAM0zSD815CWabJv3GdUxjx_jW-yHEx0Veko_FxMgKM8

Phuck you!!!!! Your a disgrace to our country!!!!!!!
Places like your Mar-A-Largo which hires illegals should be given stiff penalties. If places like Trump Enterprises are given huge fines for hiring them they will stop entering the US.
Please  do  an  emergency  order  and  lock  the  border  down  completely.  Mexico  needs  to  feel  the  pain  for  sitting  on  their  corrupt  asses  not  stopping  it  at  their  border.
Please #pray for President Trump. He is under severe attack from our enemies at home and abroad.                                                     Ephesians 6:11-12, 18  (King James)   Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
Please DO NOT cave to the angry Left. Your offer was FAIR. Please Do NOT allow the left to take advantage of you and of the American people. We the people are counting on you! Donald J. Trump
Please I need your assistance
Please Mr President fix it. because we're not safe in this country.    I have maybe one or two real family members and were struggling to survive.   it's sad
Please Mr. President do not cave or give illegals any status or benefits. Do not betray our trust!
Please President Trump. Drag Pelosi and Chucky boy down to the border. Its NOT Manufactured. Are they blind in one eye. and can't see out of the other. üò≥

Please don‚Äôt give up!
Please don‚Äôt stop
Please just find a way to bypass Nancy and end the shut down while still building the wall!
Please keep Trump as president!
Please leave this page and read Real News elsewhere about the #MoronPresident For Example: Trump Touts Border Wall In San Antonio, Which Has No Wall And Isn't On The Border  Mary Papenfuss HuffPostJanuary 19, 2019  President Donald Trump on Saturday boasted to reporters about how well San Antonio‚Äôs border wall  is working. But the Texas city is 150 miles from the Mexican border and has no wall.  ‚ÄúEverybody knows that walls work. You look at different places, they put up a wall, no problem,‚Äù Trump said outside the White House. ‚ÄúYou look at San Antonio, you look at so many different places, they go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities, immediately, immediately.‚Äù  The president may have intended to refer to El Paso, a Texas border city he referenced last week in an almost identical anecdote ‚Äï though he is wrong that the wall there had any effect on its crime rate.  Trump discussed the nonexistent wall in San Antonio before he offered three years‚Äô protection for the so-called Dreamers ‚Äî immigrants who came to the U.S. as children ‚Äî in exchange for Democratic support for $5.7 billion for his border wall. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) quickly ripped the deal as a ‚Äúnon-starter.‚Äù  Part of San Antonio is in the district represented by Texas GOP Rep. Will Hurd, who opposes Trump‚Äôs wall as expensive, ineffective and damaging to private property and the environment. His district includes 820 miles of the border. In an interview this week with Rolling Stone, he called Trump‚Äôs characterization of a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù at the border a ‚Äúmyth.‚Äù  (You can read the rest at news.yahoo.com and read actual news anywhere but on this preposterous page, led by an accomplice in the tRump Crime Family.)
Please list the laws that citizens can ignore and get a pass for breaking. I‚Äôll wait. Hussein Obama‚Äôs dreamers are America‚Äôs nightmare. Deport them all.
Please open the Gov, tell those that are blocking our wall that you will not hold America hostage because of THEIR unwillingness to work with you. You represent US and we need the WALL!!!!!  This completely lays at their feet! This is  on them!
Please open the government. My husband has been protecting the public from dangerous inmates and   is working for free. We have two children that we need to feed and provide shelter to! Please stop using these selfless workers as pawns.
Please pop over and sort Brexit for us.  Our useless MPs could do with learning how to be leaders and make the decisions they were voted to perform. üëç
Please protect me. Build the wall.
Please re open our government
Please reopen the government so people can be paid.  federal workers are innocent.
Please resign for health reasons
Please resign!  You continually embarrass our country   we want logic in place at the border not a wall!
Please resign. You are neither fit, nor well. Children were kidnapped because of you. You will get what you deserve.
Please sign the Link above.
Please stand firm Mr. President as they will NEVER give our country what we need; only want they need to regain power!  Executive order may be the only option!
Please stand firm in demanding the funding for the wall Mr. President. Getting that wall built has been a problem for the American people for a very long time and we finally have hope what was started long ago will finally be accomplished! Don't let the liberal Democrats hold us hostage!
Please stop listening to anyone but God and yourself!  Hold the line!!  I know they are hammering you but they always have.  Democcults want our nation overrun with criminals and drugs.  Start looking for the money and bank accounts they keep it in for selling our nation and our citizens out and then return it to the American Taxpayers they stole it from!
Please, get after this Big Dog, and declare an emergency and fund it anyway. I applaud your patience in trying to work with the other side.
Pledge to humans, humans!
Politicians have been destroying this country, we NEEDED a business man to save us. God bless you Mr. President. 2020 üá∫üá∏
Polls say that most Americans don‚Äôt want a wall. Who took this poll? The 22 million  illegals and some Democrats.
Polly got a cracker?
Polosi/chucky cheese hav their own agenda, 2020.
Poor Jr. High "mean girl" Nancy and her coharts, Diane, Maxine and others have the Dem. men so bullied that they cannot think for themselves.  Otherwise, the men would step up and do the right thing.  They all have voted  yes for these issues so many times before. What a waste of good minds.
Poor President Pinnochio, everyone knows that your pledges are meaningless.
Poor little monkeys....it's all about Russia. This immigration talk is all BS, all a distraction. Morons.

Ppl ppl ppl ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è plain and simple just like at our homes, some of us have fences and some don‚Äôt yet the ones with fences still get burglarized. The one way to protect our families is with fire arms, cameras and extreme access control just like the white house. So that being said I doubt the wall will work and please reopen the government these ppl need their monies.
Praise God, don‚Äôt stop, don‚Äôt give in to protecting our citizens President Trump!! As a Texan, we‚Äôve had this problem for way to long!! We as citizens should be as safe as we can!  You‚Äôve came at this appointed time, and you‚Äôre doing the Right Thing here! God bless you!!
Pray and it will go away.

President Donald Trump is trapped. He shut the government to impose his will on the incoming Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. That plan has miserably failed. Instead, Trump has found himself caught in the trap he supposed he had set for his opponents.  Now he is desperately seeking an exit.
President TRUM P you have the power to put these Hypocrites Wicked Devil Worshipping Witches & Warlocks in Prison for multitude of murders, kidnapping & selling children & adults into slavery.... Why aren‚Äôt they Arrested & Locked up? A dog can pee on the side walk but if I did they‚Äôd lock me up & these people get away with murder, rape, & crimes so unspeakable they defy ones imagination. I speak to you devils in Jesus name you will not succeed in your plots & plans! You will fail & fall into the holes you dig for others! AMEN. PUT them in PRISON where they belong where they cannot do any more harm to PEOPLE! üßê
President Trump   is keeping his promises! Let‚Äôs see how many Obama kept...hummm, can‚Äôt seem to remember any!! Oh well!  MAGA TRUMP 2020!!
President Trump - you are loved by the American people and you have our prayers and support! Thank you for wanting to keep us all safe! The Lord is on your side - God bless you and keep pressing forward! Trump 2020 <3
President Trump 20172025 I believe  most Americans  wish you  will suggest that the Despicable democrats fire bitch pelosi and  put a speaker in  who will put  Americans first,  We also want a balanced budget clause and  the elimination of the  discretionary spending clause,  no more cr' s  we also want  a smaller government and  cuts in spending, in order to reduce the Despicable debt dramatically so America's children and grandchildren  are not slaves to the debt , Tomorrow  hopefully will begin the firing of government employees:  ( the worthless incompetent government  employees)  We all are grateful and thank God you are President : 2 years since you took the oath of office.  Yay,  ;)  Thank You God's speed and God bless America and your family
President Trump You are COVERED BY THE GRACE AND BLOOD OF JESUS THIS IS YOUR ASSIGNMENT, GIFT FROM GOD, TRULY BLESSED, WHOM . GOD BLESS NO MAN CAN CURSE, GOD GOT YOUR BACK, HANDS ON YOU, ARMS AROUND YOU, HEDGES THRONGS AROUND YOU, IN THE BLOOD OF JESUS,  IN JESUS NAME AMEN!
President Trump ask God for Wisdom like King Solomon did ask in Jesus name.
President Trump asked Pelosi if he stopped the shutdown today would she be willing to negotiate the wall in thirty days and she said no.
President Trump be strong many of us can see what the democrats and the entire opposition are doing to you since day one of your presidential period and even before that. So please be strong this are opportunities for you to shine even better. God bless you President Trump! #TRUMP2020
President Trump go before Congress and tell them you will give up on the border wall if every Senator and Congressman tears down their wall or fence protecting their homes! Give them two choices. They either agree to the wall to protect our borders or they tear down their wall that protects their homes!
President Trump how does one send you legitimate ideas, and converse with you directly, you are by far the president in history
President Trump inspires us all to live a better life. A more dignified, Christian Billionaire lifestyle. He will bring back the awesome China factory jobs. I can feel the MAGA, running through me.

President Trump is always two steps ahead of Pelosi & Schumer. Let's take five billion out of the Congress's pension fund -- like they did with our social security! Congress is useless anyway! üéØüí≤üí≤üî¥
President Trump is more of a CEO not a politician. CEO's fix problems whereas politicians are all about exploiting those problems.
President Trump is one of the Greatest Leaders of all time. Samuel and John Adams, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson would be Proud of President Trumps Passion and Love for America, and all its Citizens. Federal Employee here, and I support you 100 %.
President Trump is the GOAT.  If he keeps going like he's going, he will be the GOAT of the GOATs. Short of Jesus of course.
President Trump it‚Äôs time to play hardball. Fire Pelosi and Schumer number one. stop the crazy investigations that Mueller is doing costing the tax pair a ton of money and let‚Äôs move on
President Trump knew they would reject his proposal....he is showing the Latinos ...(he was already up 19 poll points by Latinos before the speech) that the Dems aren‚Äôt there for them. Like he is showing Black American they have been fooled by the Dems for decades. Just give him a chance. He knew that he was going to use the military all along to build the wall. This is all to expose the Dems corruption. He had to wait for 30 day shutdown to get rid of deep state DEMS WORKING in the Government that he couldn‚Äôt fire. Now under RIF he can. I bet he brings back only half of the 800,000 that have been laid off. And Obama brought Muslim Brotherhood into the Government that Trump couldn‚Äôt get rid of. Just trust Trump he is smarter than you think. He is exposing the Dems and the Media to the American people about how corrupt they are. Just relax it will turn out ok. Just take a breath.
President Trump lucky time 22.1.2019 to 25.2.2019 very lucky time 6.2.2019 to 18.2.2019
President Trump made 8,158 false or misleading claims in his first two years -- Put another way: The president averaged nearly 5.9 false or misleading claims a day in his first year in office. But he hit nearly 16.5 a day in his second year, almost triple the pace.
President Trump made a fair offer to secure wall funding but rather than submit a counter offer, Pelosi rejected it before EVEN hearing it. Democrats should be ashamed of their leadership.
President Trump should invite the Covington Catholic High School students to the White House.
President Trump should keep the government closed for as long as possible so he can focus the media‚Äôs attention on the question of border security. Once the government reopens, for sure it will do nothing other than mouthing ‚Äòimpeachment‚Äô. It should stay closed.
President Trump thanks for all you do and trying to fix our borders, you are the only President who has took a stand on this, and my family thanks you, you have integrity and you also know what we need, build the wall, we have to, save our sweet country, God Bless You..
President Trump why do congress and senate get paid during the shutdown? To be honest they should be the ones not getting paid at all till things are resolved. The shutdown should mean Pelosi and everyone else not get paid at all. The workers at the government agencies like the fbi and every where else should never be affected by this. If they want food to eat make them eat a mre during there breaks.
President Trump you are a man of your word and you make me proud to be an American.....thank you for what you are doing. God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. I have never seen a POTUS love his country like Trump!  Democrats remember #JobsNotMobs.
President Trump you know you can not make a jackass budge.
President Trump,  It definitely is a National emergency to sign the declaration yourself.   Democrats will let our country fall before they give you something.   BUILD THE WALL WHERE NEEDED!
President Trump,  if you read the comments of your postings then you know you have many Americans who are so incredibly proud to call you "our President".  Thank you for all you are doing to keep America safe. May God continue to direct your administration and keep you and your beautiful family safe.
President Trump, I thank you for honoring your core values and commitment in putting America first and protecting all off us.  BUILD THE WALL.. Stay firm to your determination and address our country at the State of the Union knowing the Armor of the Lord  gives you strength, as you speak the truth.  Americans are firmly behind you. We love you and your leadership.
President Trump, can you  use any funds gained from drug raids, confiscated money for the wall?
President Trump, don‚Äôt surrender the United States Capitol to Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer go there speak to the American people. We don‚Äôt care if no one shows up as long as you do don‚Äôt let them do this to you this is why we elected you because of the kind of man you are and because of the kind of strength you have! Do your speech to the nation from the US capital! Maybe the supreme court the Republicans and others will still come but even if they don‚Äôt it would be a great and awesome thing for youTo do this and we will have great respect for you as we do right now! Don‚Äôt surrender the US Capitol building that belongs to the people not Nancy or chalk! We‚Äôre praying for you!
President Trump, please build the wall. Protect and keep America safe. God bless you and your family. üôèüèª üá∫üá∏
President Trump, please stand firm on your efforts to protect America's borders and keeping us safe. The democrats are wrong in not negotiating with you and they don't really care about the government workers not being paid or they would. It is so very wrong how the left-wing media treat you, so disrespectful to you and the office of the presidency! Praying for you!
President Trump, we love you, we support you, and please stay the course! Survival of this great nation depends on you.

Princess Pelosi has no heart for her fellow Americans.
Probably true
Projection. As usual. Insult the Dems for the faults of your fearless leader trump.
Promises
Promises made, promises kept. Stay safe and be blessed.
Propaganda for the trump regime. Regimes only exist in dictatorships. You have no idea how to govern a nation. You only know how to RIP off customers, workers, and how to sell snake oil to your cult45.  Resign and make America great again and again and again (ad infinitum).
Propaganda from the Kremlin...I mean white house!  Never thought I would see it!  First step in destroying our freedom of speech and thoughts.  Long live the Free press and our Constitution! Resist and fight!
Propaganda produced by Trumps? You are such an orange dictator you ass.

Protect America and build the wall  Don‚Äôt have a fence around your house? If you have it. Why?
Protect America. Build the wall.
Protect families of gun violence, which kills tens of thousands of people every year. That‚Äôs the REAL threat.

Question: Which Party Platform is egotistical and which is Altruistic in nature? Politics are very simple to understand. There is a balance in between "The needs of the many out-way the needs of a few" AND "A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link" If we find the sweet spot in those two things we will live in heaven on earth. President Trump is thee closest we have come to this line of thinking in our history as a country.

Raymond Mitchell But people are suffering and losing their homes and can't pay their medical bills. And building a wall won't stop people from getting killed. People get killed every day by other Americans. And the law is wrong. God wants mankind to live and work together not claim land like that. The land should belong to all mankind. And we shouldn't have to suffer just to claim land.
Read some books ffs
Reading the holy Gospel according to saint John (2, 1-11)  Glory to you, Lord.  There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding. When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him,  "They have no wine."  And Jesus said to her,  "Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come."  His mother said to the servers,  "Do whatever he tells you."  Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus told them,  "Fill the jars with water."  So they filled them to the brim. Then he told them,  "Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter."  So they took it. And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, without knowing where it came from ---although the servers who had drawn the water knew---, the headwaiter called the bridegroom and said to him,  "Everyone serves good wine first, and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the good wine until now."  Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs at Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him.  Word of the Lord. Glory to you, Lord Jesus.

Real News Traitor Working For Russia Destroys America From Within  'There's no money': Shutdown freezes HUD funds for low-income senior citizens  ‚ÄúIf something major broke, I wouldn‚Äôt have the funds to replace it," said a manager of an affordable housing building for seniors in Florida.  Jan. 11, 2019, By Suzy Khimm and Laura Strickler  The government shutdown means that the long-leaking roof of San Jose Manor II Apartments won‚Äôt be replaced anytime soon, says Alma Ballard, who oversees the building for low-income senior citizens in Jacksonville, Florida.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs definitely not going to happen,‚Äù said Ballard, executive director of the nonprofit Family Housing Management, who said that water has at times dripped into some residents‚Äô rooms.  Ballard said Family Housing Management had been saving up for a new roof for the 50-unit government-subsidized property, but had to put the plans on hold because its contract with the Department of Housing and Urban Development was still in the process of being renewed when the shutdown began. The company never received its December and January payments from HUD, totaling about $40,000, immediately putting the property under financial strain.  Shutdown threatens housing funds for low-income senior citizens The few federal employees left at HUD have been scouring the books, looking for a last-minute solution to fund hundreds of affordable housing contracts that have expired under the shutdown.  More than 200 of the contracts that expired in December are for properties, like San Jose Manor II, that provide rental assistance for the elderly, according to LeadingAge, an association for nonprofit providers of aging services. Known as Section 202, the program houses about 400,000 low-income elderly people as part of HUD's Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance as well as a separate HUD program.

Real News: On Saturday night, Breitbart panned Mr. Trump‚Äôs latest idea with the headline ‚ÄúThree-Year Amnesty, Most of Border Remains Open.‚Äù  In Trump‚Äôs Immigration Announcement, a Compromise Snubbed All Around  President Trump offered on Saturday to trade temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for border wall funding.  By Julie Hirschfeld Davis Jan. 19, 2019 WASHINGTON ‚Äî Immigrant advocates denounced it as cruel. The conservative right howled that it was amnesty.  What President Trump billed on Saturday as a compromise to end the country‚Äôs longest government shutdown pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs to strike a deal nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall.  Instead, in offering temporary protections for about one million immigrants at risk of deportation in exchange for funding for a wall, Mr. Trump did something rarely seen during his presidency. He tried to reach beyond his base of supporters ‚Äî which polls have begun to show is losing patience with him as the partial shutdown drags into its fifth week ‚Äî and speak to a broader swath of Americans.  The Saturday afternoon speech from the West Wing was an attempt by Mr. Trump to, at the very least, shift the narrative of the past several weeks and show that rather than spoiling for a longer shutdown fight or making unreasonable demands, he was looking for a broadly acceptable way out of a morass he once boasted he was proud to wade into.  ‚ÄúI think you could tell by the president‚Äôs remarks today,‚Äù Vice President Mike Pence said, ‚Äúthat we‚Äôre reaching out.‚Äù  Yet in seeking to inch toward the center, Mr. Trump alienated portions of his hard-right base, the core supporters he most depends on and the group he and his closest aides have most feared losing. That raised the possibility that, in his zeal to get out of an intractable situation, he may have landed himself in the worst of all worlds, without a clear solution or the support of his most ardent followers.  The tensions and anger over the policy have been quietly playing out in the West Wing as well, as Jared Kushner, the president‚Äôs son-in-law and senior adviser, fended off Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump‚Äôs immigration agenda. Mr. Kushner has long been a proponent of protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, while Mr. Miller has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration.  In recent days, as White House officials had been working out the details of the compromise, Mr. Miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity.  While the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that protected those illegally brought to the United States as children, Mr. Trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700,000 who are enrolled.  Mr. Kushner conceded in a briefing after the president‚Äôs speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the DACA program, which Mr. Trump moved to rescind in 2017.  ‚ÄúAt this moment in time,‚Äù Mr. Kushner said, ‚Äúthis is a good path forward.‚Äù  Many conservatives did not share that view.  ‚ÄúTrump proposes amnesty,‚Äù the conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Twitter. ‚ÄúWe voted for Trump and got Jeb!‚Äù she added, referring to Jeb Bush, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status.  Still, in the eyes of many White House officials, the prospect that Mr. Trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure Democrats to end the impasse was worth trying. Mr. Pence argued on Saturday that the speech was a ‚Äúsincere effort‚Äù by Mr. Trump to break the logjam, and he and other White House officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist Democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with Republicans.  But such a coalition did not appear to be forming, and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention, eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak-kneed capitulation.  The vast majority of Democrats knocked the approach. While many of them have pressed for measures to protect DACA recipients and immigrants living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe, most regard the proposal he put forth on Saturday as woefully inadequate. It offers only three years of protections for the DACA recipients and those who hold T.P.S., which the Trump administration has also moved to end for several countries.  ‚ÄúThis is not an amnesty bill,‚Äù Mr. Pence said. ‚ÄúThere is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal.‚Äù  That was high on Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs list of reasons to call the plan ‚Äúunacceptable.‚Äù  That is unlikely to matter to the president. Despite saying publicly last month that he would be proud to own a shutdown over the wall, and privately displaying confidence that his base would stick with him through the fight, Mr. Trump has been dismayed to find otherwise in recent days.  An NPR poll released last week showed Mr. Trump‚Äôs approval ratings down and the first cracks in backing among critical supporters, including whites without a college education and white evangelicals.  Such pressure from what he has called the forgotten men and women who elected him and chant ‚ÄúBuild! The! Wall!‚Äù at his arena rallies has swayed Mr. Trump before, including last year, when the conservative news site Breitbart branded him ‚ÄúAmnesty Don‚Äù for considering a similar deal that would have provided $25 billion in wall funding for a path to legal status for those the DACA program was created to help. The president ultimately abandoned that agreement, concerned about angering his base and after Mr. Miller and others advised him he should insist on additional immigration restrictions.
Real News: Since this was printed a new poll shows his support even lower today ...  SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT IS HIGHER THAN HIS APPROVAL RATING, NEW POLL SHOWS  BY TIM MARCIN  Will Donald Trump Be Impeached?  President Donald Trump isn't exactly popular right now. In fact, a new poll shows that more people seem to support impeaching him than approve of the job he's doing.   The survey from Public Policy Polling‚Äîa Democratic polling company that also does public polls‚Äîpegged Trump's approval rating at just 40 percent, while 57 percent disapproved. Forty-six percent of voters, meanwhile, supported impeaching Trump, while just 44 percent are opposed, according to the poll.  The survey polled 760 registered voters from January 19 through 21. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.  The survey also pitted Trump against hypothetical Democratic opponents for the 2020 election to see where things stood. Trump trailed all seven likely Democratic candidates that the company used: former Vice President Joe Biden (53 percent to 41 percent), Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (51 percent to 41 percent), California Senator Kamala Harris (48 percent to 41 percent), former Texas Representative Beto O‚ÄôRourke (47 percent to 41 percent), Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (48 percent to 42 percent), New Jersey Senator Cory Booker (47 percent to 42 percent) and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (47 percent to 42 percent).  "It really doesn‚Äôt matter which Democratic hopeful you test against him right now," said Dean Debnam, president of Public Policy Polling, in a statement. "Voters prefer any of them over Trump at halftime of his Presidency." - Newsweek
Real News: When #BigotPresident meets #MoronPresident: San Antonio does not have a border wall and is 157 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.  President Trump incorrectly claims San Antonio has a border wall  Speaking to reporters Saturday, the president cited San Antonio's nonexistent border wall as the source of improved security in the city. TEXAS Author: Kens5.com staff Published: 2:30 PM CST January 19, 2019 Updated: 2:48 PM CST January 19, 2019 WASHINGTON, D.C., USA ‚Äî Ahead of his "special announcement" Saturday on the government shutdown and the border, President Trump told reporters that "walls work," citing San Antonio's security improvement since putting up a wall.  "You look at different places," Trump told members of the media, "they put up a wall, no problem. You look at San Antonio, you look at so many different places. They go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities immediately. Immediately. It works, we have to put them up, and we will put them up. We've got to."  San Antonio, however, does not have a border wall and is 157 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.  Trump visited the Rio Grande Valley along the edge of the U.S.-Mexico border last week. During his visit, the president took part in a roundtable discussion on border security and met with Border Patrol agents stationed along the border.  Throughout the government shutdown, which has lasted nearly a month, Trump has insisted that a crisis exists at the border which would be fixed by a border wall.  During the president's visit, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told him the state will build a wall along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border if the federal government pays Texas back.

Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
Ronald Bettney WHAT?

DONALD TRUMP IS A TERRORIST... a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
Ronald Bettney poor silly walnut
Ronald Bettney what good work? He hasn't done a good thing since he has been in office.   Except say the election was rigged.
Rot in hell Nancy Pelosi
Roy  Meston,and Gary Kane,are Jerry's Kids
Roy ,you make fun of my president,  I will make fun of your queen
Roy Meston   Only because he was a stinking traitor and divider of the country.
Roy Meston  Clinton shut down the government,  Obama shut down the government......
Roy Meston  How did you get human and drug trafficking across the border from my statement?  I was pointing out the obvious Liberal bs of your repeated statement about walls around a prison don't  stop drugs from getting in as an argument against a border wall.. Keep up dude..
Roy Meston  Mexico stole the land from the Indians first then Texas kicked Mexico off the land . So technically we saved the Indians from Mexico. They were actually killing them saying they are nothing more than subhumans that need to be exterminated.
Roy Meston  You seem to think you know a lot about drugs in prison. You are either an ex con or a guard that smuggled drugs to inmates in your prison wallet.. Drugs aren't as easy to get into prison as cell phones are..and from the sounds of it, you could fit a dozen Obama phones in your "wallet".
Roy Meston  your never going to stop drugs but at least keep the people that do not have any business just showing up in our country uninvited!!
Roy Meston ! My "last name"? I'm Married!üòÇüòÇüòÇ YOU are Correct: I Am an American REPUBLICAN and HUGE TRUMP SUPPORTER (proud "Deplorable")! JEALOUS???
Roy Meston .... if you don't like Trump but you're following him on Facebook that makes you a fucking idiot...
Roy Meston ..how convenient of you to forget. When wages go up, so does everything else.
Roy Meston 90% is a slow down buddy but I'll take it over open borders ANY DAMN day
Roy Meston Another Troll
Roy Meston Creation denier let me guess... You " evolved" from a rock! Amirite???
Roy Meston Evolution is a lie you are a satanic pos. Have a nice day
Roy Meston Explain dictator? Give some examples and how it has affected you personally.
Roy Meston Fox News has the gonads to report the real news.  They cover everything the left refuses to.
Roy Meston Grow up !
Roy Meston I say deporting liberals would get Mexico to build the wall üòÉüëç
Roy Meston I think you meant to say obama the weakest president ever if you promise to be a good little boy and do the right thing and vote for trump in 2020 I will definitely send you a free maga hat and I will definitely pay for the shipping and handling remember 5 letters and you can never go wrong    TRUMP have a trump day
Roy Meston If you thought that then you have not been listening at all.."Our proposal is not intended to solve all of our immigration challenges. This plan solves the immediate crisis -- and it is a horrible crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis like we rarely see in our country. And it provides humanitarian relief, delivers real border security, and immediately reopens our federal government. If we are successful in this effort, then we can start the border [broader] project of remaking our immigration system for the 21st century. Once the government is open and we have made a down payment on border security, and immigration reform starts to happen, I plan to convene weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House so we can do a finished product, a great product -- a product that we can all be proud of, having to do with that elusive immigration problem." President Trump
Roy Meston Illogical argument...walls secure entry and exit of people...securing WHAT they bring in or take out has to be addressed at points if entry....
Roy Meston No such thig as God??? Haha you are a demon no wonder you want rape murder and chaos
Roy Meston Nope.  Republicans did that.
Roy Meston OC ‚Äú helped‚Äù millions lose their insurance that they took personal responsibility and paid for themselves, including me. Socialized medicine is a failure. Do your research... always have facts and details.... or you look verw uninformed !
Roy Meston Obama shut down your goverment a few times too.
Roy Meston POSüí©
Roy Meston That is the purpose of fencing ...barriers...they DETER....DETERING is not a waste..
Roy Meston You said he was gonna be gone last year...... üòÖü§£üòú Better go check with Cohen, he's going to the slammer... he might have some "breaking news" for ya... üòÖ
Roy Meston You think with your brain? Then answer my observation....gurgs enter prisons by PEOPLE allowed to enter through the doors...they don't pass through the walls. The WALLS do their job...they keep people in and keep people out...
Roy Meston are you an AMERICAN?? You can‚Äôt be serious!!  Why don‚Äôt you like putting AMERICA FIRST?? Can you answer that? WHY?
Roy Meston because it causes a domino effect of wage increases, also, it puts many small businesses out of business, as they often don't have much of a profit margin, their only option is to lay off workers, or incorporate jobs, which would prevent them hiring in many cases, the economy would start to tank within a short time, federal employees would probably be the first to lose their jobs, budgets would not be able to cope with such an increase!
Roy Meston can you provide facts to back your statement?!? Conspiracy theories aren't fact....just want to make sure you know that.....also, HOW DO YOU KNOW? Just speculation right?
Roy Meston could you give facts and source to your claim. You might get in touch with Mueller bc he‚Äôs spent two years and over 20,000,000 and found no facts on your claim. Otherwise, shut up!
Roy Meston do have you thought that thru do you think that the businesses are going to loose money every thing WILL go cost of living will go up which will still put the ones that it is design to help in the same place that their in now it will put them in different tax bracket which means more taxes paid. I know because I'm one of the ones mostly have worked for minimum wages for 40 years when min wages were 4.30 hr to current of 12.00 the sad thing is by the time taxes are taken I still make about the same as I did some 40 years ago may 20 dollars more a week due to taxes that is a way to get more taxes
Roy Meston do you have a door on your home? Do you lock it?  It‚Äôs the same concept as the wall. Keeps out the criminals that want to enter illegally. Nothing wrong with immigration done legally.
Roy Meston hatefilled or just ignorance?
Roy Meston have you tried building a wall? Because I can tell you that it may not stop it ALL but it will slow it down. We waste billions over dollars every year, but now we are unwilling to waste billions on ACTUAL Americans for a chance to save not only our lives but the lives of women and children who are ASSAULTED when attempting to come to America? I'm the kind of person who looks at my glass half full, you must be a half empty kind of dude.
Roy Meston how can you call saving lives a vanity project. If building a wall saves ONE person from death, or ONE person from being sexually trafficked, or ONE person from having access to drugs, it will be worth EVERY DAMN PENNY.
Roy Meston https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/01/18/politics/mueller-statement-buzz
Roy Meston if you can't figure out how raising the minimum wage is going to ruin the economy you need to take an economics class!
Roy Meston ignorant liberal comment
Roy Meston it's a cost that has to be met with an increase in cost for other things to pay a dumb burger flipper 15 an hour and they still can't even fix them right
Roy Meston no Jerry has facts. You‚Äôre the one promoting bs.
Roy Meston no Nancy pelosi has that award
Roy Meston no sir nobody owns trump je ain't getting salary from you nor any of us
Roy Meston no, that would be Mr  And Mrs. CHUCKY who are holding the people hostage...he has TRIED to compromise, which is what a leader is suppose to do. When the other side is unwilling to work with you, THEY become the owners.
Roy Meston no, the weak president was Obama
Roy Meston oh look another name calling liberal .. smh
Roy Meston other Presidents have had govt shutdowns. Do your history.
Roy Meston pretty sure the current Texans weren't the ones who stole it...ijs
Roy Meston sarcasm my friend
Roy Meston she is the one who wont give the money for the wall but your president Obama gave Iran 150 billion to a foriegn country really
Roy Meston then every President in the last 40 years has been weak.  Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Obama all shut it down.
Roy Meston they are so many lost in the snow that doesn't know who their daddy is.
Roy Meston what are you willing to bet on that he‚Äôs gone next year?
Roy Meston who did it help ? The people with insurance had theirs shoot up to pay for this  and you were fined if you didn‚Äôt have insurance and didn‚Äôt use it .. pay for your own ins.
Roy Meston yes, bc Obsma crested this hate... remember his ‚Äú hope and change‚Äù! Did he know he‚Äôs not Pres bc he sure interjects himself a lot.. no class at all. Worst Pres EVER!
Roy Meston your comment is just funny.. I mean really? Of course building a wall won't fix everything over night, but it's a DAMN start. At least there is an idea on the table.... I'm mean really?!? And you have the DAMN balls to try and talk about people's IQ's...
Roy Meston your opinion is not factual but you don‚Äôt really value facts. It‚Äôs time to grow up. Trump is admired and doing great things for all Americans even the stupid ones.
Roy Meston youre the bigot
Roy Meston, did you say the same when Obama shut the government down? Was he a dictator?  If not, why not?
Roy Meston, didn't sneak, they came here LEGALLY!!! You libs are truly delusional! #BuildTheWall
Roy Meston, thanks for leaving the country!
Roy Meston, you really need to read the proposal from the US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY where they state that a barrier of some type is critical for border security. But what do they know right?
Roy Meston, your blasphemy fits right in with the liberal ideology, pure hate and evil!!!

Ruben Granado I prefer a side of covfefe with my hamberder.
Rudy Giuliani tells Chuck Todd on 'Meet the Press' that President Trump 'can remember having conversations' with Michael Cohen about Trump Tower Moscow right up until the election‚Äîas late as November of 2016----If Trump Tower Moscow negotiations continued to Nov., statements candidate Trump made in late July (where he used the present tense) were lies:  ‚ÄúI have nothing to do with Russia. I don‚Äôt have any jobs in Russia. I‚Äôm all over the world but we‚Äôre not involved in Russia.‚Äù
Rudy nailed it again. üòä
Rudy's claim that Trump, if he spoke to Cohen, spoke only about Cohen's impending testimony‚Äîwhich *Trump had no reason to disbelieve*‚Äîis a *nonsense*. Cohen spoke to Trump *ten times* about the Trump-Rozov deal. Trump *knew* whether Cohen's planned testimony was going to be true.
Russia thinks so too
Russian bot
Russian has ties to Hillary via communism. Both Putin and Hillary are Jewishh
Russians understand better than anyone what socialism and communism.Behind the attractive slogans is the tragedy of the country and every family.And our President puts his life and health to protect our beloved America from this disaster.I would have forced all Democrats to study the history of the creation and fall of the Soviet Union.If Russia had been told in 1916 that a revolution would have taken millions of lives of three generations in 1917,no one would have believed it.I pray for our President and his victory in this struggle.

STAND FIRM MR PRESIDENT!
STAND YOUR GROUND MR.PRESIDENT!  KEEP THE SHUTDOWN! CALL FOR A CONVENTION OF STATES! KICK OUT THOSE WHO ARE BLATANTLY DISREGARDING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND DISRESPECTING THE PRESIDENT ! THEY ALL TOOK THE OATH TO PROTECT US AND THEY ARE NOT!
STFU - we're only supposed to care about the few that are killed by illegal immigrants and ignore the rest...
STOP ALL AID $ being sent to Mexico. They are using OUR tax $ that is being given as foreign aid to HELP these illegals get to the border! We can USE that money to build the WALL!!!!!
STOP DEPORTING US VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES IMMEDIATELY!!!
STOP!!!! Work together be adults!!!!  Nancy if you can‚Äôt work with the president we have then step down!!!!!
Sabryna Klug At one time in my life I had to use the system. What was surprising was you got raises for not working. More money financially and for food. I didn't even have another child. Thats why people stay on it, you're spoiled, why work.
Sad
Sad that the Swamp is still alive and well...
Sad what plan have Democrats made for border security? Why don‚Äôt fake news tell us democrats plan for border security? There is no plan and democrats and fake news are working against Americans. Democrats always voted for wall they just don‚Äôt vote for funding . Fake news don‚Äôt report that fact.
Safe borders is only the first step then deport All illegals , maybe appoint all those non essential government employyees to ICE and pay them based on the number of illegals they round up for deportation.
Sally Dietz Roy probably hasnt figured out  how to tie his shoes. Is it hate that creates the stupidity or is it the stupidity that creates the hate.

Schanel Farrelly  I am sure that President Trump knows the best route to take.  He has done it all of his life. #BuildThatWallPresidentTrump
Schumer and Pelosi are not only Anti-Trump, they are Anti-America, they support Sanctuary Status, open borders, and want to abolish ICE. Trump shut down Government but Pelosi and Schumer are responsible for the continued shut down. The funds for the wall are a drop in the bucket compared to what it costs us to support Illegal Aliens, and that cost is growing with every new one that comes. Not only do they get housing assistance food stamps (EBT), free education, free healthcare, and more monthly income than American Citizens do. Illegals get TAX REFUNDS !!!!!! They also send OUR money back to their homeland! Now someone please, explain to me why we do not have a wall???
Screw Pelosi if she had a brain she would be dangerous
Screw them.  Deport ALL ILLEGALS and build a WALL.
Sean Mac Maghnuis Probably the fascist part.
Sebastian Rodriguez  I agree and have said that all along - pelosi and schumer would rather ruin the country......
Sebastian Rodriguez  the swamp is the Government nonessential employees. They say since the lay off the government is actually working 10x better with on 15% workforce. I say we make the nonessential employees be permanently unemployed . They need to go get real jobs .
Sebastian Rodriguez Democrats are going to ruin the economy.  Raising minimum wage to $15 an hour will cause that!!
Sebastian Rodriguez Only the blind can not see the economy is tanking and Donnie raking in the bucks from the tax payers
Sebastian Rodriguez its proven the economy is up lol
Sebastian Rodriguez who‚Äôs really ruining the economy? Hmmm? You want this president to give in to a bunch so they can do this again & again!
Secure our boarders. If illilegal immigrants don‚Äôt want to work for citizenship then we don‚Äôt want them in the US. My parents obtained citizenship.
Secure our borders!! I wonder what color the wall will be.
Secure the Nations borders Don. If 20,000 kids entered just last month. There is something going on our public is not aware of - and it's dead wrong. A burden is being excepted on top of the America taxpayer and many do not agree to foot the bill. Stop this crazy policy NOW.
Secure the border Mr. President.
See Brian Martin :D you have so much incommon with Mexicans already
See there you go again, showing your intelligence. You have nothing to say or add so you revert to name calling. Not that it matters but I'm not a liberal. Doesn't matter what party I associate with. I as you are am an American and Patriot. I have and will vote outside my choise of party period.
See.....all I want is a VERY simple comment. Just a couple of sentences.   I voted for....  because...   How hard can that be for a CFO?
Seeking a Declaratory Judgment... The minority leader in the Senate and the Speaker of the House have made it clear that they will not budget funds requested by the President regarding the southern border and the safety of American citizens and legal residents of the U.S.  Under the Constitution the President has the obligation of protecting American citizens and legal residents in the country.  Further, the minority leader in the Senate and Speaker in the House have made it clear that not only won‚Äôt they support what the President says is necessary but will oppose the President in court. Therefore, we recommend that the President through the Attorney General, seek a declaratory judgment from Federal judiciary on an expedited basis that he is entitled under the constitution to use available funds to undertake protective actions along the southern border.
Seems to work all over the world..are you on the take somehow...
Seems we have someone that condones the trafficking of children and drugs.
Sell California to Mexico for 5 Billion and build the wall.  It solves Two problems...
Sen. Jeff Merkley released a document revealing the Trump administration intended to "traumatize children and intentionally create a humanitarian crisis at the border." #FamiliesBelongTogether  Send a list of Trump's impeachable offenses to your members of Congress here: http://bit.ly/2roqU7H #TrumpResign
Send all off them back . They are criminals and economic terrorist
Send me a friend request.
Sending a letter to Nancy is a bad idea. I do not want my name address & email spread all over the internet and I do not choose to receive unsolicited email from political organizations or causes. Declare a national emergency and build the wall without congress. You are the boss so make an executive decision and get the job done Mr. President.

Sent my two bricks to Nancy !
Sent the letter. Thanks.

Separation of power. Sorry about that
Seriously?! Work permits and social security numbers for illegals so we can attain the border security we want and demand?! NO! Do not cave to the dems!!! You KNOW what we the people want and deserve!
Several thousand illegals climbed over a fence into New Mexico last night and no one stopped them...several thousand mostly men.  Build the Wall!

Sha-nee Lacey I‚Äôm Always have my facts and details. I prefer not to argue with nitwits with only ignorance and hate... they don‚Äôt want facts. Sort of like you. Your time would be better spent on doing your research. Maybe read The Constitution of perhaps a Bible. You have a blessed day.
Sha-nee Lacey that might be your problem. Facts are easy to find. Do your own research. If it‚Äôs s problem maybe you could find a third grader to help you.
Sha-nee Lacey they can draw unemployment til the government shutdown is over and then they get back pay.

Shame on pelosis
Shame that the tragedy these families have suffered is being used as a political shot; being victimized by the Orange traitor.
Shameful and disrespectful to treat our fellow Americans this way. Our country deserves better and President Trump is working to get it done ! Build the walls, secure the borders and protect our nation!
Shannon M Kent was killed in Syria this week by the ISIS Trump claims is defeated. Two years of lies and one manufactured crisis after another .....as for agenda , still waiting for much better and much cheaper healthcare.
Sharon Samuels. Really? Hate crime is up 75% since Trump took office. His followers have shot up newspapers, churches, concerts and synagogues. They've been caught planning terrorist acts and some have actually bombed a Mosque or two. There was the inept MAGABOMBER endangering the lives of postal workers, secret service and elected officials. There was and still are nazis freely walking the streets and terrorizing innocent Americans not to mention the nazis in Charlottesville that killed an American. But, your leader called them fine people.   Maybe if you keep to Nazi rallies and klan meetings, you'll feel safer.
Sharon Samuels. You're not safe because of Trump. Ironic, isn't it?
Sharon, they had to use it to provide for all the illegals that came in.  Annual cost of illegal immigration: OVER $84 BILLION. Yet Democrats will NOT spend 5 BILLION to keep Americans safe & stop drugs. Wake up Taxpayers! #BuildTheWall üá∫üá∏
Sharon, you can always seek help from Community services, Food banks, etc.
Shaun Pewe Wow! That really did the trick. Facts remain the same, though. ü§™
Shawn Timmons, are you kidding? We have congress with a 19.3% average approval rating while Trump is at 41.4%. But then it‚Äôs Trump who is unfit? Who is unfit are the myriad of insincere politicians who take great care when they talk by not really trying to say anything in the process
Shawn Timmons, that‚Äôs fine! Then don‚Äôt bitch about the shutdown. Trump can wait, and wait, and wait.....
Shawn Timmons, why don‚Äôt walls work? We already know why so many liberals don‚Äôt work.
She acts like a crazy dog. She just barks, against the President! Shut your mouth up, Nancy Pelosi and let the President do his job.  BUILD THE WALL is good for our country. Good for you and for your next generation, too.
She already knows
She doesn't  want to hear the TRUTH. Just like she stated she "Rejects your Facts". Well if they are FACTS , how do you reject them????
She doesn‚Äôt care. Just there to collect a pay check.üò°üò°
She don't care
She don't care what you think. Get rid of her.
She in control take order from the criminal  Clinton
She is a card carrying Communist..  wants nothing more than to destroy America
She is a disgrace to our country put her out to pasture with the rest of the old goats.
She is a reptile.
She is afraid to meet with themüòû
She is doing such a great job in California with homeless and picketing teachers. She is a joke. California picked the biggest idiot to run their state.
She knows Americans want the wall she simply doesn't care.a wall would interfere with the Democrats ability to flood the country with Democratic voters doesn't matter whether they're legal or not most Democrats now believe anybody can vote in our country.
She knows Americans want the wall.
She knows if she tries  to say something intelligent she messes it up or if she lies she is so obvious!
She knows she can‚Äôt tell the truth
She looks more like a fish.
She meets with illegals???
She needs to go
She was too busy planning her family vacation.
She won‚Äôt listen, she is brain dead
She wouldn't want a first-hand account of the damage her policies have caused
She's a drunken coward
She's a fucking power hungry ass backward drunkard wetbrain
She's an evil BITCH... simple
She's had her hissy-fit and tried to fly away...now it's time to step up and act as if she's an adult.
She's such a Anti Christ.

Sheila Lessing - Did I?
Sheila Lessing Being rejected from the military had nothing to do with Ron‚Äôs comment. Because Donnie baby has bone spurs and is obese Ron is questioning how strong can the moron be?

Shirley Terry Harrow   Representatives, please put US citizen‚Äôs rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it‚Äôs more efficient, and they don‚Äôt throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities‚Äô computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S. Constituents, if you ‚Äòlike‚Äô this, like it whenever you see it.   https://m.facebook.com/The-Great-1461-Day-Adventure-360025854356893/

Shirley Terry Harrow power and greed are evil things.
Shirley Terry Harrow really, what about about the other 99.54% of the murders committed in this country by US citizens. Any thoughts and prayers on those. Anytime someone is murdered is tragic to say that Nancy Pelosi doesn't feel empathy for the family and friends who have lost some one to these violent act suggest that you yourself lack empathy, I hope not. Unfortunately we are seen as one of the most violent countries in the world. Praying that you find the love of Jesus in your soul once again.
Shirley Terry Harrow stop spreading trumps hateful lies-
Shirley Terry Harrow you are confusing Nancy with he's the one screwing you. too dumb to know
Shirley Terry Harrow you really don't expect humpty dumpty trumpty's family to be affected. Even though he relates to average Americans. What a fake
Shirley Terry Harrow you think if someone‚Äôs family was hurt they become racists?
Should Donald J. Trump go to trial?
Should be no lifers in congress. Term limits are needed. The president has term limits. Why don't they?
Should go after crazy white guys, who are responsible for more violent crimes than any other group.
Shouldn't the priority be to build a wall around Bowling Green to stop another massacre?  Alternative Facts -Kellyanne Conway  White lies -Hope Hicks  Truth isn't Truth -Giuliani
Shove your wall up your.... !!!
Shut down Congress's pay until this government shutdown is resolved. They should not get played to vacation while the government is shutdown, shutdown Congress.
Shut the whole border down! Stop all money transfers to Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala!
Shutting down the government and causing the severe grief of 800,000 people is hardly an accomplishment.
Sieze Mexican bank accounts, businesses, tax remittances, close the border except for commercial traffic. These countries are sending their unwanted they are unemployed and uneducated, these people are a drain on their economy. Countries have gone to war for less. Build the wall.
Sigh, how many times to we have to tell you, the wall is not going to stop terrorists or drug smuggling!  According to Justice Department public records, no immigrant has been arrested at the southwest border on terrorism charges in recent years.   And most drugs are smuggled into the United States onboard fishing boats, trains, tractor-trailers and ordinary cars that come into the country at legal ports of entry. The wall won't stop any of this.  The wall is a scam and a distraction!

Silly Billy gumdrops. Closing the government until you get funded? More like holding your breath until you turn blue..ya whining baby.pfft
Simply cannot understand why she thinks shes in charge
Simply put don‚Äôt make promises you can‚Äôt keep.  You are really good at that, it‚Äôs called lying.
Since Israel built their wall, terrorism in the Jewish state has decreased by 99% which proves that walls work, even the least intelligent among us understand that.
Since Pelosi and Schumer refused to meet with Angel Families in their offices, BRING THEM TO THE STOTU AND LET THEM TELL THEIR STORIES.
Since only US Citizens have the right to vote in the USA WHY should non-citizens be counted when determining the number of representatives from any area!
Since they didn't want to make a deal when the supreme court's end DACA start deporting them, to late for deals then.
Sir 2 good objectives I suggest you stop combining.  Work them both independently.
Sir, that sounds comforting to American,s,dont mind enemies of progress,the democrats,americans are feeling the impact of your work ability.
Sir, with more caravans careening toward the U.S., with Mexico "helpless" (and no will) against stopping them, with Pelosi's stubbornness at the expense of Dreamers, PLEASE 1) stop ALL monies, foreign aid, etc. to Mexico and Central America until they stop offloading those they don't want onto us, including Child Tax Credits. Defund any state who uses fed gov $$$ for sanctuary or welfare for illegals.  2)  Tie the Ninth Circuit into knots if necessary; it is unconscionable that one court is the tail that wags the whole nation with injunctions. Let Jay Sekulow loose on this. Alan Sears and Mat Staver, too.  3) Prevent all money earned in the US from being wired to Mexico and Central America.  4) Since Congress has failed miserably to stem the influx or to stop their entry, do whatever it takes to repel at the border; let Mexico arrange the trips home for the illegals. "This far and no farther" at our border. 5) Discover who is funding the transportation for the illegal caravans; drag them into court, sue into oblivion. Charge for enabling crimes against the citizens of the US.  6) Allow no amnesty except if begun properly in the homeland.  7) Use cash and property seized from Mexican cartels to secure the border absolutely.  8) See if the FCC can demand the faces of the 4,000+ killed by illegals recently can be scrolled across the bottom of every screen in the nation. Enough is enough. This far and no farther.
Sir. I live in San Antonio. What wall are you speaking of. Please tell me because I‚Äôd like to go see it
Sir., you tried your best, you gave it a good/hard shot. Now do it Don, call the emergency.
Small minded
Smells like taco meat
Smh
Smoking what?
Snarky Larry when will you get this through your thick skulls...Drumpf is a horrible man, a horrible POTUS and a Russian asset....oh and a criminal who has gotten rich ONLY by cheating, lying and threats?
So AMERICA HAS LOTS FREE SOIL HELLO AMERICANS SHOULDN'T GO HUNGRY WE SHOULD HAVE FOOD BANKS FILLED  WITH GROCERYS
So Charlie you didn't answer my question. Are you actually special needs? I'd hate to be a bully if you were?
So I guess this means if you make all the Europeans leave there will be no more MASS SHOOTTINGS???ü§îü§îü§î
So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one.                                                                                                  Ezekiel 22:30.
So Janice you admit the wall won't stop them?
So Jerry do prisons have drugs being sneaked in then?
So Pelosi states "NO" prior to the speech. She and her group want the Gov't opened, then they will proceed to "talk". Let's see now: You loan me $500,000 now, and later we will "talk" & I will agree to sign the Contract, well maybe and maybe NOT.  Hilarious ! Or is there a problem with what sits above the neck  on the LEFT ? That is an assumption that others are as dumb as you are.

So Stumpy, if you want to secure the southern border with your folly of a big beautiful wall then explain how 367 refugees were able to tunnel under your magnificent all? And, not one word about the 1 million Federal employees and their families who have had to suffer because of your petty partisan politics. Yesterday afternoon you sounded desperate and you appeared to be weak. It's time for you to resign!
So Todd what about your BJ  Clinton was getting in the white house ü§î
So basically, f*ck the well-being of non-government working Americans suffering for every other reason.
So by trumps own words the wall is Americans throwing billions of dollars in the trash
So do your JOB! Use your authority to send the military to secure the border and build the wall! The military just got a huge 745 Billion dollar budget! The non secure border presents the threat of terrorist crossings, and no telling how many already have, while we're being jerked around on the wall issue! This is a matter of National Security, and reclaiming our Sovereignty as a free and independent Constitutional Republic! You do not need congressional approval to secure the border! This is a matter of National Security and the safety of the American public! Stop jerking us around!
So dumbass's late night tweet storm was a gem, literally threatened the safety of 11 million people if his tantrum goes unanswered. This is exactly how fascism starts. Enjoy your dictator and traitor in chief, and wait til youd next on his purge
So everyones gonna act like obama didnt build a wall, huh?
So glad Killary lost
So heartbreaking for the true victims! Stand Tall & Stay Strong and NEVER STOP SHARING YOUR TRUTH. God FINALLY sent a President that loves his country and Walks the Walk! May the Blood of Jesus always protect him and his family and may the Voices of these families be heard loudly and be recognized. God Bless!
So if Ed Buck runs, you got his back? LOL dumb mf https://www.colorlines.com/articles/second-black-man-found-dead-major-democratic-contributors-home
So kindly please
So many Russian accounts in the comments lol
So many members of this administration devote so much time and energy to figuring out ways to try to explain blatant lies as remotely resembling something in the neighborhood of a mere miscommunication. How on Earth do people fall for this schlock? To put it bluntly, they might not be thinking hard enough. The technical term for this is "reduced engagement of open-minded and analytical thinking." It‚Äôs okay for you to believe what you believe. It is not okay however, for you to insist that everyone else believe the same as you. This border crisis is made up, check the facts. There is a border crisis, but it‚Äôs not the southern border, it‚Äôs the northern border FACT! We don‚Äôt believe you, we get the facts via factcheck.org. STOP LYING TO AMERICA!‚Ä¨
So many of us are with you.  Two more caravans are coming.  Declare an emergency and get it done.  Lets the courts battle it out.
So many things I want to tell Nancy and her inbred son Chuck
So many trolls....
So much patience our President has to protect America's citizens.  The wall is so needed and frankly I  don't see where Nancy Pelosi is coming from or whomever agrees with her. Why would she not vote for the wall when the result of not having it will hurt our citizens. Is she anti-American?   Thank you President Trump for the protection!  We need to feel secure in our country!
So proud to call you our president!!!  I pray for you DAILY!
So proud you‚Äôre my president!!!
So sad that trump supporters are filled with hatred and fear of others. They support a man who lies and is morally bankrupt. Sad.
So sorry for your loss! Now let all of us build that wall.
So that makes you a far  right nut job?
So the country can crash and burn but we really need a wall how stupid do  that sound
So to me it would make more sense to arm the border patrol with unlimited resources of sophisticated anit-intrusion equipment.
So true
So true European didn't understand why American military members acted like FOOLS when they drank, rape, when they could go down to RED LIGHT DISTRICT, we could sent our preteen to buy beer at the TRINK HALLE  and they brought home, the USA LOOK at everything as a mortal sin
So very hateful for Pelosi to act like this. Needs to be removed from job
So we are just making stuff up now.
So what if a family member was life was affected by the US citizen? I'm not allowed to be part of the angle family because the person that did the crime was not illegal?üôÑüòú
So what made you change your mind on immigration system mr trump , i truly suspect your caving in sir lol .. funny man you are .....
So when is Mexico going to pay for the Wall?
So when is Mexico paying for it?
So why are you wasting time negotiating with the devil?  Get it done!  Your base didn‚Äôt elect you to meet the lunatic left halfway to hell!  They are going to bitch no matter what you do, so let‚Äôs quit waiting.  The wall needs done now and need to focus on healthcare reform, people paying way too much for crap policies!
So why have there been over 3,000 immigration staff positions unfilled?  Why haven't you spent the money already allocated for border security?  Why didn't you make this your priority the first two years when you controlled both the House and Senate, instead of spending all the time on multiple failed attempts to destroy the ACA, and passing legislation to enrich the rich and burden all of us with a massive deficit?
So you admit you don't know what you're talking about then Lawana Porter?
So you don't know why a republican hailing the Queen is funny then Charles? :D
So you expect to make a deal by offering a temporary solution and you expect a permanent wall?  You‚Äôre a terrible negotiator.  How about permanent status for the DACA problem for your permanent steel fence?   SMH
So you sacrifice government workers in order to get this stupid wall.
So you say stop the chaos in your staff ? But in mean time the chaos that goes on in government the outlandish spending, sexual misconduct, rape, the payoffs the chaos in government and your ok with that and you bitch about his administration? Hmm do you not see the problem with this ?
So you want to waste tax payers money to slow it down now? That doesn't seem like a good expenditure?
So you'll be inviting the Covington Catholic High School students over for some hamberders?
So, ILLEGAL Aliens don't claim taxes? Naw.. They claim MULTIPLE children that aren't even in our Country, and get 10's of thousands on their returns...  https://www.facebook.com/guadalupe.pena/videos/10161288925775858/  #BuildTheWall!
So, Pelosi won't talk to angel families, she won't donate the $1.00 she said she would give to Brian Kolfage for the wall, her voice mail box is full, she's joined at the hip with Chuckie Schumer (Nan-Chick-It), and she absolutely will not negotiate with our great President Trump for the wall - she said it was a non-starter even before she heard the proposal. Do we need any more proof that this "elite" will not listen to THE PEOPLE? TRUMP2020 MAGA. This is the best country on earth, and she wants to lead people to destroy it.
So, thoughts and prayers aren't good enough for them? What about all the people killed by the mass shootings that we have almost EVERYDAY?
So... you want 5.6B... and for that you shut down the USG, and by doing that, put our securety at higher risk then before?? You must be a special kind of stupid, ain't ya?
Solve two problems in one day.  Legalize drugs.  Give illegal residents a little slip of paper to stay.  Next problem?  Guns?
Some crimes are not preventable, but ALL illegal alien crimes are preventable.  #MAGAüíØ #BuildTheWall üá∫üá∏Ô∏è  -

Some person dirty my room
Somebody in democrats dictated Nancy Pelosi of what she suppose to do as speaker of the house.Work together to our leader for the better of our nation.
Someone compared Spanky with King Solomon. A better comparison would be King Christian VII of Denmark. Look him up!
Someone else wrote this, enjoy:  Have you ever wondered why someone would spend millions ( mostly of other people money) to get elected to a job that pays $174,000 year? Because of the FOIA, all this information is out there if you care to research it. For instance, in the last two years alone, Congress and the Senate have spent $4.66 Billion in airfare for themselves. Our money. $2 million a year for parking, our money. Now keep in mind, every member of Congress on top of their annual salary of $174,000, receive $1.5 million in an expense account, while senators each received $4.2 million each year. This is for offices, staff, etc etc..And unless the expense exceeds $25,000, it doesn‚Äôt need to be accounted for. After two terms, they receive 70% of their annual salary as a lifetime pension. Plus social security, plus a house pension plan. And then in 1998, they gave themselves an additional pension plan called the Thrift Savings Plan. They said it was needed to match the private sector 401k plans, but theirs is much sweeter. Here‚Äôs how it works... each congressman gives 1% of their annual salary to the plan. For this, the government, ie you and me, add 5% of their total salary to the pot, for a total of $10,440 per year in a private pension. That‚Äôs a pretty good deal, $1740 and you get $10,440 guaranteed. Lords and Ladies, Kings and Queens. They rule over the peasants. When the country was founded, congressional pay was $6, per week. And remember, it was never meant to be a full-time job. Congress was only to meet two months a year to do the people‚Äôs business and then return to their homes and jobs. Republic? They can‚Äôt even spell Republic. It‚Äôs an oligarchy with lords and lady‚Äôs who keep the peasants in check by passing more and more laws and restrictions. And if you go against the empire, you will be crushed and everything you love destroyed. So work, pay your taxes, obey the laws, vote in the make-believe elections, and be a good peasant. Because until a present-day George Washington comes along, that‚Äôs what we are, tax-paying peasantry who are ruled
Something is wrong with this man people are going hungry and can‚Äôt pay their Bills and your ass worried about a dam wall. You had the house and senate for two years and the day the Democrats beat your a‚Äî you pull a stunt like this. Our life is so in danger if we don‚Äôt get a wall!!!! Was our life in danger two year ago?You will never under the American struggle You Dumb ass Billionaire!!!!

Sonja Sherrod So which is it? O was lying then or "Dims" are lying now ü§° Mr. Trump raised concerns pursuant to the election being rigged, Obama lashed out at him. In October, literally only days before the election, speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Obama swung at Mr. Trump, saying: ‚ÄúThis is just more than the usual standard lie. That is not a joking matter. That is dangerous because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in other people‚Äôs minds about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy.‚Äù It‚Äôs worth noting that America is not a democracy, but I digress.ü§°  "Dims" spent the next two years blaming Russia hacked the electionü§°
Sonja Sherrod Sure everyone else is lying  Use your Obama doll and point to where it hurtsüòÇü§°

Sonja Sherrod liberalism is definitely a mental disorder sister.
Sonja Sherrod sure when all along the Hillary and Obama collusion, uranium one! Oh nothing to see here ....tick Tock.
Sonja Sherrod wants out? Yea whatcha smokin?
Sonja Sherrod yea, two years and $25 million and nothing is found on our President. But the left wing media loses their breath on every breaking story and talks of impeachment and there is AGAIN NOTHING! All because you Demoncrats lost in 2016 . Get over it! You will lose again in 2020! KAGüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è
Sonja Sherrod ‚ÄúThe Obama administration said on Friday that despite Russian attempts to undermine the presidential election, it has concluded that the results accurately reflect the will of the American people.‚Äù  Trump is your President üòé
Sorry Chammy Ney Ney Jr..  I tagged the wrong peson...This question is intended for James Ahssanipoor. So here it is ole buddy.   James thinks Hillary Clinton did NOT have textual relations with that server.  I mean........ anyone could accidentally delete 33,000 e-mails that would incriminate them. Right? He wants Hillary Clinton back in the white house with Bill Clinton by her side. That way Bill coud have wild passionate monkey love in the oval office on TAXPAYER'S money. Hey James. .. Did you know that Monica Lewinsky had a birthday recently? She's in her 50's now. It seams like only yesterday that she was crawling around the white house floor putting anything she could find in her mouth. They grow up so quickly these days. Don't ya think so James? Hillary Clinton will screw over America in a Benghazi minute.... but just answer this question James.... If you didn't vote for Trump,  who'd ya vote for and why? That's a VERY simple question. A simple answer will do just fine.
Sorry for your loss!
Sorry to say something
Sorry wrong box lol I just posted a petition on my page I thought this was a negative comment on that
Sorry, I was wrong Bob. The latest average of all polls shows Trump T 40.0%. The 41.1% is about 3 days old. That is how fast Trump‚Äôs approval rating is falling. I should have waited till Monday to say the numbers were below 40%, they are AT exactly 40% today.  Good to see you are supporting a 41% Presidential rating. Most of his followers insist he has a 50-60% positive rating. Hope you continue to support Trump when he falls below 35% favorable.
Sorry, Lara. I can't see your face and not think of the horrible misleading media about racing greyhounds that you've been a part of. HSUS and grey2k are nothing but FAKE NEWS and you deserve to be a part of the truth, not their false agenda. Find some greyhound people and discover the truth
Sounds more like revenge on a culture for a few people's mistakes ,
Spare us your bullshit please Donald.  You've had two years and have done NOTHING.  This is an obvious sham to distract from the investigation AT YOUR DOORSTEP.
Speak for yourself only! You go to Hell!
Speaker Pelosi proves she doesn‚Äôt have Americans best interests as a top priority by hiding in her office
Speaker Pelosi ‚Äôs Secret Overseas Mission Included 93 Family Members? Why? ‚Äì THE MARSHALL REPORT found Pelosi had all of her children & grandchildren ‚Äì 93 family members going with her on her taxpayer funded trip to Egypt, Afghanistan & Brussells???
Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi didn't want to meet Angel Moms. Did Pelosi notice that her office walls kept Angel Moms out?
Spineless Trump: according to the latest e-humnt in me. I believe, I will make you inverted to. since you like dick in your mouth, now ill see that you swallow it.  strong for venezia
Spoken like a good little socialist robot who hasn‚Äôt got a clue. There‚Äôs the door, Gary. No one will miss you.
Spot in. Do include Fake news segment.
Spot on! Walls do not work! Build better security within the country...tell that MORONIC POTUS to stop his fear mongering! He is getting the people all riled up! Look within!

Stan Piznarski  Never will be re-elected. Imprisonment.
Stan Piznarski  Representatives, please put US citizen‚Äôs rights first by starting the process for the following:  Reconstruct the federal court system so that it‚Äôs more efficient, and they don‚Äôt throw out the appeals, especially misconduct appeals, of US citizens. Also a system that demotes and promotes judges based on their record on being overruled, etc.   Start a constitutional amendment to modernize the Presidential Election process. Start a constitutional amendment that makes: US Representatives elected on odd years, a US Senator term four years long and elected on even years opposite the president, so their constituents have a representative to vote for every year, etc.  Make a law that gives nonaffiliated candidates and voters access to primary ballots. Create a government website for voting constituents to state their concerns, and monthly rank those concerns by their importance to US citizens. Create a Federal Highway Patrol for our interstates and federal highways that gives returning veterans opportunities for jobs, and federal highway laws.  Improve the interstate system by: raising the minimum speed limit, lengthening busy entrances and exit ramps that will make it safer and help eliminate delays, etc.  Mandating more required car safety devices.  Define a minor as someone under 20, and extend free education for dependent minors through a community college or high school college accredited courses, and free public preschool.  Protect employees who make written complaints for improper or illegal company actions. Require public schools and government facilities‚Äô computers accessible to local US citizens. Set up an investigation into updating the future of climate change, etc.  Sincerely,  Cecil James Roth P.S. Constituents, if you ‚Äòlike‚Äô this, like it whenever you see it.   https://m.facebook.com/The-Great-1461-Day-Adventure-360025854356893/

Stan Piznarski Amen
Stan Piznarski DONALD TRUMP "FOLLOWERS" LEARN TO WIPE YOUR OWN ASS, STOP WAITING FOR HIM TO TELL YOU WHEN TO JUMP AND HOW HIGH, THINK FOR YOURSELF, IF YOU HAD ANYTHING HE WANTED HE WOULD STEP ONNNNNN YOU!!! IF HE CARED AT ALLLLL ABOUT AMERICANS, THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WOULDN'T BE SUFFERING BECAUSE OF HIM, NOT LIBERALS NOT REPUBLICANS AND NOT DEMOCRATS, THIS IS ALL HIM. WANNA BE RUSSIAN DICTATOR!!!! DONALD TRUMP IS A TERRORIST... a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
Stan Piznarski Do you know how many AMERICAN BORN KILLERS ARE SITTING ON DEATH ROW EATING THREE MEALS A DAY GETTING MEDICAL ATTENTION.  You will not save this country with a wall period.  DONALD TRUMP "FOLLOWERS" OPEN YOUR EYES AND WIPE YOUR OWN ASS AND THINK FOR YOURSELF AND YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY AMERICANS ARE, ARE CURRENTLY, SUFFERING NOW OVER A WALL. THE HUMAN TRAFFIC SCANDAL IN ARIZONA ALLLLLLLLL AMERICAN BORN POLITICIANS!!! CRIMINALS COME IN ALL NATIONALITIES AND THE BIGGEST CRIMINAL OF ALL IS IN CHARGE OF THIS COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T CARE WHO HE STEPS ONNNNN!! NOT OVER ON!! This is a political statement.  This wall is the most ridiculous thing ever.  "Followers" who can't wipe their own ass and who are waiting on Donald Trump to tell them when to jump and how high voted for this terrorist because they can't think for themselves.  DONALD TRUMP is a TERRORIST: a person who uses intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
Stan Piznarski I pray not.
Stan Piznarski I totally agree with every word you said here.
Stan Piznarski Maybe the President with the help of Congress can designate an easement of the much of the border as one long protected National Park or Monument and then legally use funds to protect the vegetation of the parks with a wall, due to ecological impacts from Illegal immigrants destroying the protected lands. An existing example of something similar to this would be the Roosevelt Reservation.
Stan Piznarski Moron BOT
Stan Piznarski Moron, total moron!!! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=291263014920132&id=350410435343749
Stan Piznarski On June 12, 1987 the beloved Republican President that gave us trickledown economics, Ronald Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev the General Secretary for the Communist party of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall -  And I quote:  ‚ÄúThere is one sign the Soviet Union can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace... Mr.  Gorbachev TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!!
Stan Piznarski President Trump will be reelected unless the Democrats are able to keep bringing in hundreds of thousands of illegals for their illegal votes. Yeah, that's a pretty scary scenario!
Stan Piznarski Right On....
Stan Piznarski Sorry, Stan .  The fake president is still bull manure.
Stan Piznarski Stan the man at Bellevue mental hospital, how's it going girlfriend, still on those weekly ECT treatments I see
Stan Piznarski True! Thank God for Donald Trump!
Stan Piznarski Trump has pissed both sides off with his latest proposals. The right hate the fact he is talking about amnesty for the Dreamers. The left say it‚Äôs a nonstarter with Trump holding the government workers hostage.   His approval rating is now under 40%, a death sign for all Republican office holders. Not a good time to have a last name ending in Trump or being part of the Trump led cult.   The Trump bandwagon broke down many miles ago. It is sitting on the side of the road with broken wheels and flies buzzing all around. The buzzards are circling overhead, they are attracted by the smell political rot.
Stan Piznarski WHAT?
Stan Piznarski What did Tne Liar do to tear down America, and now has to rebuild it, when America was great under Obama and Clinton?  No one can give a straight answer to this Question.
Stan Piznarski agree
Stan Piznarski another russian bot posting here I see
Stan Piznarski copy and paste much bud... no original though needed...
Stan Piznarski do wop
Stan Piznarski he is a terrible deal maker, it‚Äôs all a fraud!  More importantly he is either going to back down on China or eclair he made a deal, but it will be a deal that weakens America.  I don‚Äôt ask you agree, I understand your support and I support you as an American.  Please scrutinize whatever deal he makes with China though, don‚Äôt just believe ‚Äúit‚Äôs great‚Äù because he says so.  The future of America relies on it.
Stan Piznarski how come all of you mother fuckers that claim to love America so much can never speak or write in proper English?

Stan Piznarski, not every American loves Trump and I believe that there are more who dislike him. Trump doesn't care about building America, all he wants to do is build a wall. In the meantime my nighborhood is being ransacked by dangerous criminals who are actually legal American citizens. None of us are really safe and especially our schools. Our factories are not coming(roaring)back, many have moved to Mexico. Imagine that! No, not every American loves Trump and he is the one who is impossible, especially his promises which he cannot keep.
Stan is not a bot. Delete your comment immediately.
Stan you look like a bigot! I bet you‚Äôre a bigot?

Stay strong Mr. President. The majority of the American people are with you. TRUMP 2020.
Stay strong Mr. President. When we took our oaths we signed up for all that it could entail. We deserve to fight till the end! My vote at the General Election was as such... "God almighty only He can make America Great Again! If it werent for that Id chose Trump Pence as Washington wasnt a Socialist he was an American, when we vote it is in hus honor. I am not certain any socialist can honor the late General Washington." I voted in faith, keep the faith! I never vote as everyone else, I vote to make a statement. I hope that during your time in office you not only will make a statement but stand on principle. Let us not forget to honor the man who risked his life to secure a nation. Let us continue to honor his memory! Whether Yeshuah is in an ossuary or risen he was a good rabbi remembered 2k yrs later. As we remember Yeshuahs memory we should also remember our founders! Mach a bracha!
Stay strong Mr.President
Stay strong President Trump! We are praying for you!

Stay the course!  Democratic politicians are looking worse by the day!
Stay the course.
Stay the course. Build that wall!!!
Stay with it Mr. President. We support you sir. The swamp is being exposed! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the obvious, the people who do not want to support border security are not working for the tax paying law abiding American citizens but instead working for illegals who choose to go around our laws and sneak into our country. Keep pulling the plug Mr. President, this is why we elected you! #2020
Stephanie Kay Shockley He is doing what's right! He wants to keep America safe,if your kids or any loved ones were one of the many people that were killed,raped,and beaten by an illegal immigrant ,you would want the wall as well...

Steve Tash lmao, what an argument. Obama increased national deficit $10 trillion, more than every other president combined. And Russian spy? That will remain the most ignorant crap being spewed by democrats until Trump is done. When I have thousands extra back on tax returns, I don‚Äôt give a crap if CEOs are getting tax breaks. Newsflash by the way, when large companies get tax breaks they invest more in workers, create new products, open new facilities, etc. That‚Äôs good for Americans. Stop spouting crap from the left wing media.
Steve Tash poor thang!
Steve Tyree Revisionist history much? PLEASE don't tout your education when you spew such a ridiculous spin on why it was close to impossible for President Obama to get his agenda accomplished. It's people like you who astound me. You have some intelligence and such chosen ignorance at the same time. It's mind boggling.

Steven Whitehead the reason why the majority of the country do not like this president is because he has no idea what he is doing. He is currently under investigation for helping Russia rig an election. Because he is a conman. Because he does not care about the American people and the was proven by his speech yesterday. Never mention the people out of work at all.
Stfu
Stfu traitor
Stick the wall up your fat white supremacist Nazi ass, traitor,,,metese pal cono cojedor de cochinas
Still America great !
Still dont understand why Dems can give Obama 150 billion for Iran don't recall any vote
Still dont understand why Trump supporters can give Trump 150 billion brain cells for America don't recall any vote
Still running your mouth
Stop holding  800,000 innocent Americans and their Families Hostage. Reopen the Goverment.
Stop just talking about it Mr. President & do it since it's within your authority to do so. Just do it already!!!!
Stop paying the members of congress, and no back pay neither
Stop paying the politicians and see how fast they will come to the table to negotiate ..... Donald J. Trump   OUR PEOPLE NEED TO E PAID !!!!
Stop talking about it and do it!
Stop the Shutdown come to the table with the American people AND THOSE 800,000 can get paid! Starting with an offer with a temporary plan for a permanent situation is NOT an opening or proposal it's BLACKMAIL! An offer to give something back YOU took away is NOT a PROPOSAL IT IS BLACKMAIL. USING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS BARGAINING CHIPS IS NOT A STRATEGY... IT IS EXTORTION!
Stop the chain migration!
Stop the democrat shutdown now. Build the wall!
Stop the dems. No socialism in my country.
Stop the iligals criminals!!! Build the wall!!!
Stop the money
Stop the salaries of the Congress, Senate-declare a national emergency.
Stronger border security is a must.  I pray the ones against it don‚Äôt find out too late.

Supporting President Trump 100%!!
Surely their is funding somewhere for the completion of the wall and a military presence there, and get people back to work without having to depend upon the Deplorable Dems. Those who came illegally should be deported unless they apply for asylum at THEIR US embassy where they can be heard quickly and be housed and protected in lieu at that site until their onsite asylum hearing.NO BENEFITS for those who cross illegally, they should be deported to their local US embassy immediately.
Susan Dawn McGuire how come these people are "angel families" while Trump calls the victims of school shootings a the hands of white Americans "crisis actors" ??  When has he met with them?
Susan Dawn McGuire no, that one will go to the idiot who took PRIDE in not paying people.
Susan Diane 1. you are ten times more likely to get killed by an American white guy than an illegal immigrant. 2. No one is born here illegally. If you are born here you are a US citizen. Check the constitution. 3. There are many more American crime gangs than illegal immigrant gangs. 4. Every immigrant, even illegal ones pay sales taxes, income tax and social security. They don't get tax refunds nor are they eligible for social security benefits.

THANK YOU
THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT.  BUILD THE WALL.
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT... for the first time in many years we have a leader who is not controlled by special interest and Wealthy lobbyist... I pray that your supporters become more aware that our sovereign nation is a Constitutional Republic governed by We the People... and that there are probably hundreds of our own elected representatives who don't want us to know what that means and don't want us to support your effort to restore to us that awareness. Unless we are very vocal, and not just here on social media, but in contacting our congressmen and representatives making our voices heard.... the more he speaks to the people the more he brings like to his reality of the darkness in our three branches of government.
THANK YOU for not caving in.
THANK YOU!!! President Trump
THANKS FOR SHARING THIS WITH US  WE DO HAVE THE BEST PRESIDENT THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD AND HE IS ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR ALL OF OUR BEST INTERESTS AND  HE DID NOT TURN THE ANGEL'S MOMS AND  FAMILIES AWAY,  HE GREIVED WITH THEM AND AGREED WITH THEM THAT WE NEED THIS WALL OF PROTECTION AGAINST THESE VIOLENT CRIMINALS WHO ARE FLOODING INTO OUR COUNTRY EVERYDAY FOR HARM AND NOT GOOD.  GOD BLESS OUR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND FLOTUS AND FAMILY AND OUR LEADERS AND AMERICA EVERYDAY AND WE NEED TO BE PRAYING FOR ALL OF THEM EVERYDAY,  I DO EVERYDAY BUT HE NEEDS  ALL OF OUR PRAYERS.  SHALOM AND SHABBAT LINDA BAUROTH AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THE SPIRIT AND OF THE ARMY OF GOD.

PASS IT ON. WRITE PRESIDENT TRUMPS FACEBOOK. THIS IS MONEY THEIR SPENDING FROM SOCIAL SECURITY THEY KEEP TAKING. PEOPLE DO SOMETHING,  HELP BUILD THE WALL.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT.    LOVE IT SUPPORT IT OR LEAVE IT.
THIS is a key point not enough people have been making.   Under questioning Trump *actively hid from U.S. intelligence what he'd been doing*. And if Flynn knew any of what Trump was doing, so did he, as he was in the classified briefing with Trump on August 17, 2016.
THIS is a key point not enough people have been making.   Under questioning Trump *actively hid from U.S. intelligence what he'd been doing*. And if Flynn knew any of what Trump was doing, so did he, as he was in the classified briefing with Trump on August 17, 2016.  And didn‚Äôt report either the deal or the contacts as the FBI requested in their security briefing, and lied about both  In that briefing, U.S. intel was *also* informing Trump that the Russians were going to try to infiltrate his campaign to influence him. It's evident that those statements (plus questions) were intended to provoke disclosures from Trump about whether any such effort had begun. Beyond having spoken to the briefers, Mueller would know from Flynn exactly what Trump said during that meeting, in other words how many lies he told to law enforcement bout his contacts with the Kremlin. And those lies, told during a criminal investigation, would be *crimes*.  That's why I have Making False Statements on the list of "collusive crimes" (in this particular fact-pattern, i.e. the Trump-Russia investigation). Because that's almost certainly what Trump did on August 17, 2016 and Mueller would have multiple witnesses to confirm it by now.

TRUMP IS, "INDIVIDUAL 1" and implicated in 2 felonies in court documents. BEWARE the Trump Low life cheesy lying UnAMERICAN crime family.  MORE MANAFORT INFORMATION WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL.

TRUTH - It is terrifying to think that almost every single air traffic controller in the United States is currently distracted at work because they don't know when their next paycheck is coming. Think about that the next time you get on an plane. Oh, and how do you think TSA workers are feeling, working without pay?
Take South America away from Russia and China.. Make it, another State! Kick the Rome out of it asap.
Take five billion out of the Congress's pension fund for the wall -- like they did with our social security! .. Congress is incompetent anyway! üò°ü§°üí©üî¥

Tell Nancy and Chuck to come out from behind the walls around their homes
Tell Nancy if we only use technology to secure our borders, it will use facial recognition technology which means EVERY illegal immigrant will have their data stored on all law enforcement computer databases countrywide. What does that mean? That means that ICE will be able to tap that database to locate, detain and deport many many more illegals than a simple low tech wall. Does Nancy really want to go down that path?
Tell Nancy pass the bill so she can find out what‚Äôs in it
Tell Nancy she's fired

Thank you Lara !
Thank you Lara Trump for sharing the real news....Mrs. MaryAnn Mandoza has to live with sorrow for the rest of her life.  She gave birth to a fine Son and grew him up on the right side of the law'; then lost him a day after he wished her a Happy Mother's Day.  Her Son Brandon "is" an Angel along with thousands of families who lost loved ones from illegal migrant crimes.  Nancy Pelosi, turns her face away. knowing we have a major problem.  She's very aware that the border wall is "must have"  She is hard-faced and cowardly ignores this group without empathy for their loss.  Just "one" life taken, should be more than reason enough to Build the Wall. President Trump is a Father, and a good one at that. We all know, he is totally against alcohol, drugs and crimes, respecting life itself.  He boldly and passionately took it upon himself to strive for a Great and Safe America and what a fantastic job he did in a short time. #walkaway and Reelect President Trump 2020 to finish what he started.
Thank you Lara for your insight  each week. Thank you for having this Angel Mom on this week. I wish the whole world could see this broadcast... I hate to see the pain in her eyes, but to know our President is working hard for us all gives me hope.  God Bless America
Thank you Lara!üòá

Thank you Mr. President for all you do for us.  The letter Nancy wrote to you uninviting you for the State of the Union, should you decide the wall is a crisis, proves Nancy thinks it's a crisis too. All the proof you need! She drew that conclusion without even conferring with Homeland security and other top officials!
Thank you Mr. President for staying strong. We are behind you and pray for you every day! We want a secure border. We want a wall.
Thank you Mr. President we stand with you. MAGA!!!

Thank you Mr. President.   Pelosi's home district in San Francisco is in disorder.  Homeless people sleep in the street and use it for a toilet.  Men walk around nude trying to attract other men.  Now she is trying to turn the whole country into a wasteland.  We all must let her know that we want a Wall on the border.  Go to her website and get her addresses for her offices and send a letter there so she receives a huge volume of mail to let her know we don't want to be like San Francisco.
Thank you Mr. President.  Stay the course and keep exposing the corruption
Thank you Mr. President.  We love you.  Stay strong.
Thank you Mr. President. We watched your speech yesterday. It was fantastic. Build that wall! Sick of these Dems putting illegals before Americans.
Thank you Mr.President!
Thank you Mr.President.  Build the wall. Because you did not repeat the deep sorrow that understood the commentary of the woman caster and when you should push forward the wall for peace and order improvement even from a part necessary with precedenceÔºåI thought personally.
Thank you POTUS for living up to your campaign promises. May God be with you
Thank you Pres. Trump!
Thank you President Trump
Thank you President Trump !!  We need the Wall.  WALL is CHEAPER !  The additions and upgrades proposed by the Democrats will incur Information Technology infrastructure costs that will eventually exceed the cost of the wall. New digital sensors, cameras, outdoor wireless repeaters, expensive servers to monitor the new equipment, expensive switches to carry the network load. Remote hardware stations needed to allow access to sensors in remote areas.  Digging to extend hard wire networks.  Server updates, sensor and camera firmware updates, switch firmware updates.  The IT costs alone are mind boggling.  THE WALL IS CHEAPER !!!!
Thank you President Trump for all you do!  We support you.  Stay the course.  Build the wall!
Thank you President Trump for being a man of your word. Proud to call you our President!!!
Thank you President Trump for everything you are doing keep fighting for us.

Thank you President Trump for keeping your promises to the American people.  Just imagine what could be accomplished if DemocRATs and MSM (but I repeat myself) have you one half the cooperation they gave O‚ÄôBlahblah.  I remember that despicable display at the last SOTU when they refused to stand and clap for the flag, USA, legal immigrants OR honor Angel parents.  Why do DemocRATs support every country but Americans and USA?
Thank you President Trump for keeping your word and fighting to secure the wall on our southern border. Praying for you that it's a win-win and the wall goes up.

That analogy does not work in this case...
That batshit crazy woman won‚Äôt speak with Angel families because the left side hates the truth. I‚Äôm sure that with her acting like a bitch to these families, it will be more votes for Trump for 2020.
That doesn't fix the immigration system Only a Democratic Congress can do that.  Trump is nothing short of INSANE.
That dumb cunt wont listen
That girl just isn't too bright
That hag isn't going to listen to anyone  that wants the best for all Americans. She is so delusional in her way of thinking yet she has security and walls that keep people out.  We all want security for ourselves and our families because too many nut jobs out there ready to pounce and take what isn't theirs. Why is it so hard to understand what our President is wanting? God help us all.
That has brought actual tears to my eyes :')
That is WHY I VOTED FOR YOU! LOVE YOUR PATRIOTISM!
That is enough, the dumb bitch. Should be ran out of Washington and removed from Speaker at least !
That is messed up. He should of never been here
That is why I voted for you and will vote for you again!  Please fix this country‚Äôs serious problem with illegal immigration!  I am all for people applying for citizenship.  If they are sneaky enough to come here illegally, what else will they be sneaky about!  My son works full time plus overtime and still has to live in my basement as this state has insane rent rates!  Why is it he pays for health Insurance, can‚Äôt afford a decent apartment, has to buy his own food yet an illegal can walk right in and have all that on my son‚Äôs dime when he can‚Äôt have that himself?
That kid taunting the Native American with that MAGA hat is quickly becoming a steadfast symbol of hate in America. You can‚Äôt spell ‚Äúhatred‚Äù without ‚Äúred hat‚Äù
That man needs a HAMBERDER! üòâüòÜ
That nasty Bitch Nancy needs to be fired!
That wall was about communist and to re-unite the 2 Germanies... this wall is to keep the illegal, criminal invaders out and have legal immigration enforced!
That was a ‚Äúweak‚Äù breaking announcement üòùüòÇüòùüòù
That was your last Potus...
That woman is everything but right üôèüèª
That's a fact. You can always have your opinion
That's all that's Important we keep fighting
That's good don't care what you think bye bye
That's how America pays for its Black Ops these days isn't it? Sells coke and smack to the ghettoes?
That's how Pelosi got some of her money from the land owners in California hiring the illegals for CHEAP labor working the fields.  And of course not just California.  The woman needs to go!  Judge Jeannne exposed her yesterday on her show. Did you know that Chuckie dirt face Schumer has been in congress for 38 years and nasty evil Pelosi for 32 years? When are we going to get 'TERM LIMITS' on the ballot in all of the states?  There has to be a way!
That's like expecting a feline to bark like a dog.
That's my President! üí™üá∫üá∏
That's right
That's the logic you're all using aye? Big wall, more guards, safe America. Go live in a jail and see what it does to stop illegal drugs?
That‚Äôs funny when rival gang members came into my back yard and had a shot out with the gang next door I had a wall put up and guess what no one has gotten back on to my property.
That‚Äôs why you are President! Let no one and nothing stop you.
The "AMERICAN"people appreciate you President Trump!!! We are behind you üíØ%!!!! MAGAüíØüá∫üá∏
The Almighty Creator is saying please go ahead Mr President. Your action is for the good of humanity. God bless President D. Trump.
The American people can see that when you had house power, you and your own people didn't budget the wall, but once you lost power, suddenly it's an emergency (that somehow was ignored for 2 years by you) that isn't your fault?????
The Americans are not satisfied with occupying your land, killing your people and plundering your wealth. They come years later and make films to talk about how painful it was for their soldiers.
The Angel Moms are not public enough, despite they are trying. Need much more penetration and saturation of their stories. Too many people still haven't heard or are ignoring their stories. In that same vein, where are the legal immigrants? Legal immigrants should be out in force, all over the media, decrying the unfairness and danger of illegals. Where are the Angel Moms? Where are the legal immigrants? Neither of these groups are vocal enough or visual enough to make the impact they need to make.
The Bill of Rights lists ten specific Human Rights, which are ‚Äúinalienable‚Äù and ‚Äúendowed by our Creator‚Äù, such that no government can grant Rights, or take them away.  According to the Constitution of the Unites States, these Rights ‚Äúshall not be violated‚Äù and ‚Äúshall not be infringed‚Äù.  In fact, ‚ÄúCongress shall make no law to abridge‚Äù them.    Each of these Ten Rights is delineated below.  Parenthetically, current examples of a legislative code, act or agency which has since abridged each Right, follows.  There are too many examples of Abridged Rights to list, so only a couple are provided for each.  Read the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations for a full list!  All Ten Rights under the Bill of Rights are now abridged, revoked or restricted.  Having also legislatively erased the Separation of Powers, and the Definition of Free People; the U.S. Constitution is consequently null and void; and no law, act, or code, is legally enforceable.  The U.S. Government currently operates without any constitutional authority, just like every other oligarchical organized crime syndicate, and You Simply Have No Rights.  We can‚Äôt even use their own laws against them, because they exempted themselves from virtually every law they‚Äôve written.  In other words, it was a bait and switch from day one, and we are still falling for it.    1.	Freedom of Religion, both the establishment and practice thereof. (IRC Section 501(c)(3); 98 US 145; 494 US 872; 374 US 398) 2.	Freedom of Speech, Press and all forms of Expression. (Federal Communications Commission, 413 US 15; 484 US 260; 509 F. 2d 1133) 3.	Freedom to Peaceably Assemble and Protest the Government. (HB 347; 491 US 147, 150-51; 534 US 316, 322; 312 US 569, 575-76) 4.	Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms. (107 Stat. 1536; 307 US 174; 48 Stat. 1236; 350 Fed. Appx. 874; 701 F. 3d 81) 5.	No Soldier shall be Quartered in any House without Consent of the Owner. (National Defense Authorization Act requires taxpayers to fund all housing of soldiers whether they agree with the taxes and use of the militia or not.) 6.	Freedom to be Secure in your Persons, Houses, Papers, and Effects; Against Unreasonable Searches and Seizures. (The Patriot Act, the National Security Administration.) 7.	No Person Shall be Held to Answer for a Capital, or otherwise Infamous Crime, unless on a Presentment or Indictment of a Grand Jury. (National Defense Authorization Act subsection 1022, Title X, Subtitle D) 8.	In all Criminal Prosecutions, the Accused Shall enjoy the Right to a Speedy and Public Trial, by an Impartial Jury. (National Defense Authorization Act allows for infinite detention with no trial or due process.  See subsection 1021) 9.	In Suits at Common Law, where the Value in Controversy Shall exceed Twenty Dollars, the Right of Trial by Jury Shall be Preserved. (Small Claims Court, 293 US 474; 118 US 545, 553; 319 US 372, 389) 10.	Excessive Bail Shall not be Required, nor Excessive Fines Imposed, nor Cruel and Unusual Punishments Inflicted. (Death Penalty, Infinite Detention, Forced Military Service, No Bail, Mandatory Minimum Sentences. 18 US 359 1(b); 84 Stat. 1236; 10 US 246)
The Constitutional Party The interest paid was tax payers money!!
The December 2017 draft memo‚Äîwhich Merkley shared with NBC News after receiving it from a government whistleblower‚Äîshows that Trump administration officials wanted to deport children more quickly by denying them asylum hearings after taking them away from their parents.  "It appears that they wanted to have it both ways‚Äîto separate children from their parents but deny them the full protections generally awarded to unaccompanied children," concluded ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, who led a class-action lawsuit on behalf of migrant parents.  President Donald Trump's "child immigration strategy is immoral and comes from a dark place in the heart of this administration," Merkley declared, responding to the revelations on Twitter. "Children are NOT expendable commodities in political battles."
The Democrat party are now the servents of LUCIFER!
The Democrats attack is on the middle class. They want open borders to flood the work market So they can lower our wages. And to punish us for voting for Trump! Stay strong Mr. President!
The Democrats do not care that their children are on drugs?
The Democrats don‚Äôt care nothing about this moms son that got killed my and they don‚Äôt care how many men and woman die trying to keep America safe only the Democrats care about is the 2020 election üó≥ and gaining there control back and there power back that‚Äôs all people wake up and take back your America god bless America
The Democrats have a plan to fix the immigration problem, Trump just wants a wall
The Democrats like I said will not agree to anything unless it benefits them. We need more border security and some type of wall. We can't even take care of our own people (elderly, disabled, poor). Yet we're suppose to let all these people in our country and give them everything. No, something has to be done.
The Democrats supported ‚ÄúBorder Security". along with a complete overhaul of our Immigration Policy, so dust off Schumer‚Äôs 2013 Bill (that the Republicans killed in the House), have Trump sign it and get Win Win Wall!!  On June 27, 2013, the Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act by a 68-32 margin ... The Bill was Not Considered by United States House of Representatives and Died in the 113th Congress!
The Democrats want illegal immigrants to come into the country to vote Democrat and keep them in power forever!! Democrats seek power at any cost! The Liberal Elite and Hollywood including the Democrat Politicians have huge walls around their houses with 24 hour top of the range security, they are safe and crime don't effect or involve them!!
The DemonRats are like major obstacles & dead ends in Trump's way.They know the truth & they know what's going on at the southern border, but Nancy & Chuck the schmuck, want Trump to fail & that's why they're saying NO to everything he wants. I believe Trump will do what's right for his country because unlike the DemonRats, he really cares & will do what he has to do, NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!
The Dems are not going to give this Pres. a win, especially the Wall. They would rather see the country destroyed than to do that. And the Dems have the nerve to call the Pres. a traitor? Bunch of hateful hypocrites.  That's all they are. Everything they're accusing the Pres as being is exactly what the Dems are. Best Pres. the US will ever have. MAGA 2020!
The Dems are the ones holding the government employees ransom. Blame them.
The Dems do not care about the Angel families!
The Dems have rejected your very generous offer. They now own this shutdown. Close the border indefinitely, including legal ports of entry.  Declare a National Emergency. It is not fair that illegals are jumping ahead of legal applicants to get into the U.S. , where they will be released. American taxpayers are tired of supporting illegals. Government-dependent illegals and refugees are going to collapse the economy of this country. That is the goal of Democrat Socialists and Globalists who are trying to implement NWO.
The Dems like Nancy Polisi and Chuck Shoemor  needs to lose there paycheck also and give there paycheck to all the people out there that aren't getting paid and just remembered that Polisi have said one thousand dollars was crumbs to most that are getting that much just to live on one week at a time or every other week , giving only a dollar isn't fair to most that Believe in the wall and other things makes us as American in this country  it's just not fair üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
The Dems will NOT compromise with anything, President Trump has presented, so it's time to declare a National Security Emergency!!
The Dummycrats are just mad because they lost the election.
The Europeans are legal american citizens! STHU!
The FINGER POINTER! ...As Usual, playing the "Blame-Game" on others for YOUR OWN Nasty & Vile actions! ...STARVING America & Holding Us HOSTAGE For YOUR OWN Dark Purposes Is NOT Okay! #LockHimUp #ImpeachTrump #NotMyPresident
The IRS needs fixed too.... https://www.facebook.com/1624953898/posts/10215589646327306/
The Liar in Chief preaching to the Sheeple!!!
The MSM and MSLiberals are completely covered in HATRED for our President and anyone who disagree with them. We see this in the recent drama from Buzzfeed. Absolutely amazing the reaction they had before they knew the truth and now after they know the truth. It‚Äôs a COMPLETE MELT DOWN.  WHAT A F‚Äî‚ÄîD up way to live!!!
The Obstructionist will not even. come to the table to comprise and work for the benefit and security of the American people. I say Declare a National Security Emergency, Build The Wall and open the Government for employees to get back to work and nothing extra like abortion money or foreign money. !!
The President is now the Apprentice and is being schooled in reality..
The President offered ALL the items the Democrats want as per Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs rejection letter except only a three year extension on DACA and TPS recipients into 2022 (well after the next presidential election btw) in exchange for $5.6 billion for physical security on the southern border. Tell me again who is to blame for me continuing to work without a paycheck?? #sendabrick.
The President singled-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place!   Giving them back is supposed to be a good offer???   For something Mexico was supposed to pay for? Oh hell no.  STAY STRONG NANCY
The RUMP is an imbecile, cares nothing about the US, but I do have a question for you, Are you tone death to the truth or just plain stupid ..
The Republican Congress made the same commitment for non-stop border wall funding for 2018 and 2019 of $1.3 billion each year.  Trump vetoed the Senate 100-0 vote in 2019.
The Republicans are NOT STUPID!!!  Dems WON'T negotiate now, they won't  negotiate EVER, if Trump opens the government now. üò°üò°üò°üò° Declare a NATIONAL EMERGENCY and build the wall!
The Secret Service was never contacted by Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs office or other Democratic congressional leadership regarding their ability to protect the president, members of the administration and Congress during the State of the Union. official.https://t.co/Wz0dhf4VQ2
The Socialist want open borders, division, and chaos.  I want America to stay the way she has always been,  a Country where we live freely.  I will not give up my Constitutional rights or Freedom to Socialist so they can have full control over me,  I am an American and I simply will not do it.  If they want open borders they can move to Germany, Britain, France,  any European Country that have been taking over by Socialist.  That's where they belong.  We have lost way to many children because of their policies.  The laws say protect and defend not ignore and let in....Let us have security please and a closed border.
The Statue of Liberty welcomed every ship bound for Ellis Island, it‚Äôs size and position in the harbor shouted Welcome to the United States of America.   Those emigrating  to this country PAID (yes, paid!) to board a ship as a passenger at their port of departure. There was never a guarantee that their paid passage would not end up with one or all of their family members being returned. They were not required to have a passport or visa. However, they were REQUIRED to enter this country LEGALLY. Incoming ships to the port of New York were stopped at a small island off the coast of Staten Island prior to being received at Ellis Island. Inspectors would board the ships to vet passengers who were deemed mentally or physically ill or any who were involved in criminal activity. Those passengers deemed a threat to the well being of our country, were NOT gained entry. The remainder of the passengers were forwarded to Ellis Island where they were processed. Thousands of immigrants arrived daily to Ellis Island and in most cases their processing took only a few hours and then immigrants were released to acquire citizenship (which most did) Those who were cleared to enter the USA were directed to rail transportation in order to connect with their DOCUMENTED SPONSOR. Immigrants waiting to be processed were afforded the opportunity to BUY ( yes buy - not given) food at the Ellis Island commissary after exchanging their currency.  Those who were detained for health reasons were placed in a holding pattern and were given food and drink for free. If a child over the age of 12 was denied entry due to illness, they were sent back to their country of origin ALONE via ship. Those under 12  who were not deemed healthy enough to stay were SENT BACK to their country of origin with one parent. Children and adults requiring any type of medical attention were sometimes held in the infirmary and were CHARGED A FEE (Yes they paid) for any medical services. My great grandparents along with millions of those who emigrated here from various countries did so by LEGAL means and were not afforded a free ride, nor did they expect anything for free except entering a country where all citizens lived freely.  When they arrived, family took care of family. I am proud of my Italian/Irish ancestry. Reopen Port(s) of legal entry similar to Ellis Island and apply those same rules. In addition, those who fail to enter legally through the legal port(s) of entry will be denied citizenship forever and remain deported.  Allow all illegals presently living here to be processed in a similar fashion.  If they have been receiving assistance from the government and have not obtained work,  make a mandatory military service of 2 years minimum to gain immediate citizenship. Any new citizen convicted of a major crime within one year of obtaining a citizenship will be deported. As an employee working at the World Trade Center, I survived two terror attacks. How I remember the flags waving and the ‚Äúwe will never forget‚Äù signs, post 9/11. How quickly everyone forgets. I will never forget the numerous funerals I attended, nor the fear I still live with to this day from what I witnessed. Welcome to the United States of America to all those who wish to do so legally and are willing to give back to this country by working and making this great land of immigrants a prosperous and safe place for future generations.   God Bless the USA!!
The Trump crowd thinks taking a knee at an NFL football game is disrespectful to veterans. Yelling build the wall at them, well that is just good old Christian values at work.
The US-Canada border is 5,525 miles long and it receives less resources and fewer border agents than the US-Mexico border (which is 1,954 miles.) The number of illegal border crossings along the US-Canada border has increased by 142% in just one year. Fenatyl, Marijuana, Ecstacy and coke are the most common drugs smuggled into our country from Canada. It also serves as an easy entrance for terrorists to enter into the US. Border agents along the US-Canada border have made statements about how easy it is for human trafficking and drug smuggling to slip through, due to the lack of man power and resources. Thousands of traffickers and smugglers illegally cross, completely unnoticed by border security and drawing all of our attention on the Southern border only makes it easier for them to do so. The Northern border is currently a bigger threat to us than the Southern border. Overstayed visas also account for 2/3 of illegal immigration and Canadians are the highest when it comes to over stayed visas
The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.
The WALL, the WALL!!üá∫üá∏üòçüá∫üá∏üòçüá∫üá∏üòçüá∫üá∏
The Wall won't stop anything. Prisons still have drugs right?
The Washington Post is the most left wing nut job paper in the country and the supposed data they have conjured up is not based in fact. Sorry for those who point to the Post as a source. Please grasp the truth of this. Any crime by an illegal is way way to many. To make it worse is the idea you would defend the idea that illegals have some right to murder American and get a pass from the rest of us. You are some kind of nut job all by yourself.
The amount of Drugs and Contraband criss-crossing the US Canadian Border is double that of the US Mexico Border but it's never brought up hmmmmm..
The art of the deal is being played out and its obvious Pelosi didn't read the book lol.How can people of this country not see how Pelosi doesn't care about her own state all she cares about is attacking Potus.
The asshole had 2 years to get his wall while he had the power and couldn't, now he doesn't have the power so he blames Dems.What a fool.
The b$$$h won‚Äôt listen, too power hungry, she doesn‚Äôt care about AMERICA, only her power. She wants control of our lives.
The best  2020 ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù

The best ever president.. #Trump2020..üôåüôåüôå.
The bill that would have kept the government open was voted on and passed by the Senate on December 19, 2018. It was sent to the House. The House added $5.7 billion to it for the boarder wall, voted on it, passed it, sent it back to the Senate. It has sat there on Mitch McConnell‚Äôs desk where it was last considered on January 2, 2019 with McConnell refusing to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote. This shutdown is squarely on the shoulders of Mitch McConnell.  , wtf
The border is safe and secure!
The border is up and the drugs harder to bring over he busy these days .
The communists even boast about owning the Democratic Party! https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/19997-top-u-s-communist-boasts-that-party-utilizes-democrats
The democrat communists are criminals and dont care what we think , they dont have no interest in our opinions , they live in fortresses and want to be kings to make us slaves and shut us up once and for all
The democrat leadership needs to fell this ladys pain
The democrats Remember that the doctrine of a party is essential to reach the ectica, it is the opening of divine providence to where great men come, among them Donald Trump, an economist converted in the justice of human rights, is the heart that flows . the movement. It is not a theater but a spontaneity where wisdom flows. it is necessary to support our President, where logic is the evidence of the old problem of immigrants who have not found a solution today, I invite you to join the President to help our workers and increase their talent, if they are among them, young Dreamers their gift of being American citizenship.
The democrats are no longer the party of JFK.
The democrats new strategy for the 2020 elections. A times reporter stated this on BBC.  Then a senator said the same thing.  President Trump would Not get the money for the wall,  he doesn't have many supporters, and in so many words his supporters are uneducated, drug addicted, deplorable people. This is how they want to keep saying this so the people will believe it. President Trump wants to keep his campaign  promise to build the wall.  The democrats want to make sure he does not keep that promise to the people and lose his supporters, that is there new strategy to win in 2020. I guess the democrats don't know the spirit of a deplorable.
The dems have already made a decision to never agree to any bill you put forth so call it now- NATIONAL IMMIGRATION EMERGENCY AND then release the docs to expose the corruption
The dummycrats are about to fold
The dummycrats dont like him because he makes to much sense for them.
The dummycrats will sign this week
The end of the month is almost here and people who are renting are gonna get evicted because they are not going to be able to pay rent..  but Trump has a big ass roof over his head....
The entire left are full blown communist Anti American! As we are witnessing they place our enemies and all Illegals BEFORE AMERICA!
The establishment Republicans and Democrats are paid by globalist to stop the wall from being built.  No matter what you do or offer them, they are going to hate the President.  BUILD THE WALL because your refusal to build it will cause those that supported you to walk away from you.
The fact she refuses to meet with those families speaks volumes! She‚Äôs already disregarded, and disrespected one mother to her face! üò° Nancy is an insane, hateful, vindictive fool who is seriously overcome with TDS!
The fact that some undocumented immigrants have committed violent crimes is no justification for demonizing all undocumented immigrants, anymore than the fact that some American citizens commit violent crimes is justification for demonizing all Americans.  Besides, your simpleminded solution of a wall won't eliminate the bulk of undocumented immigrants.  https://www.npr.org/2019/01/16/686056668/for-seventh-consecutive-year-visa-overstays-exceeded-illegal-border-crossings
The favorite refrain from the Trump Administration:  ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt happen. But if it did, it wasn‚Äôt a crime.‚Äù
The fear is that if they support Trump to build the wall, then his second term election is as good as won.
The government needs to stop paying out to illegals by giving them welfare, jobs, etc. And instead use the money they'd save on the wall!!! Illegals shouldn't be receiving welfare, getting jobs, receiving tax refunds or any thing period.
The group dug under a steel barrier in seven spots about 10 miles east of a border crossing in San Luis and made no effort to elude immigration agents. They included 176 children. @realDonaldTrump President Donald J. Trump
The guy that ran a Campaign about AMERICA FIRST America First America First America First  Does away with 800k American JOBS that held key positions in our government that made us all a little safer. The Heartbeat of America.  Then realizing he had to have a few hundred thousand working. ORDERED them back to work with NO PAY. Like they are his subjects working under him in a MONARCHY. . America First for a promise to the people just does not jell with his actions.  I say, put them all back to work with back pay. Then when back to work, Talk about spending money on the MEXICANS.
The immigration system broken ethir way you look at it?!.
The immigration system is not broken. Enforce the laws as written.
The individual school boards need to take care of their own schools!!  Local schools = local solutions!
The insanity in this post. What campaign promises has he made good on? Lock her up? Repeal and replace? Drain the swamp?  His approval rating is not only the lowest it's ever been for himpersonally, but the lowest recorded approval rating of any president ever. Where in the world are you getting your "facts"?.
The left is just trying to make the President look bad. They have nothing to show what they have done for the American people. We need term limits for all of Congress.
The liberals should be warned that if they keep poking the tiger, they're going to get bit.
The mans a toddler in a tantrum. Stamping his feet like a child because he wants something he will never get.
The meeting, which took place on June 23 in Kiev between ConverDyn external link and Ukrainian officials, is another indication of Kiev's attempts to diversify its future energy needs and distance itself from Russian-produced energy, reports pro-Ukrainian news website UNIAN.
The number of families affected will grow daily... The politicians need to stop fighting the fact there is a problem. Denial will kill
The office of the presidency is broken.
The only "CHAOS" we've ALL come to see is the Democrat party. LOUD AND CLEAR. Go check Hillary's bleachbit emails, fake Russian dossier, and your BUZZFEED so you'll feel better now.... üòú FORMER DEMOCRAT  #TrumpHasMyVote
The only WALL Trump cares about ‚Äî is the wall closing around Trump from the Meuller investigation.
The only chaos happening to Trump is all the lies the media throws at him on a daily basis. Just like the buzzfeed report that he told Cohen to lie to Congress ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they completely made that up and sheep like you believe it.
The only people who are keeping the government shut down are Trump and McConnell, who refuses to let the Senate do their job to vote on bills...like the ones that will open the government without any strings attached, which are sitting in the Senate and which the Democrats already passed in the house (and which are identical to prior ones that the Senate had unanimously passed).
The only pledge he made is to some big corporation that they can build the wall
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing   #Edmund Burke  And I do think the good men and women are tired of doing nothing.

The only way Trump can stay out of prison is by keeping the government closed.
The other party is the party of Benghazi and they have a similar policy for America.  Lets roll! SHUT THEM DOWN and send our people the support they request before they're overrun.
The president is stupid plain and simple!!! Stupid wall stupid for shutting down government. Stupid for being him!!!
The president should send nancy to the jungle and leave her there
The problem is...Democrats do not give a damn about this country.  Could care less if criminals and drugs come in through the border.  Could care less if Iran got nukes.  Could care less about the economy.  Could care less if America gets screwed in Trade Deals.  Could care less about expanding America's horizons such as space or energy independence.    No, Democrats dont work to make the US great.  That's the last thing on their minds.    Democrats work 100% of the time...to get power or hold on to power.   And the money and perks that come with it.
The reality is we all know you haven't done s*** about anything for this country. You haven't done s*** about healthcare but f*** it up more. You haven't done s*** about our infrastructure, you f***** it up more. You basically are worthless.
The reason we elected President Trump was to fix this messed up country. The wall has got to be built.
The shutdown is a guarantee that CORRUPT 45 is a one term president!
The socialists want the votes of illegals. That's the basis of the problem. Until we repair the voting laws in this country that problem will remain the same. Let's demand proof of US citizenship before anyone can vote. That proof cannot be anything from the DMV.
The swamp creatures are getting dug out of the swamp ! üòä
The thing about the wall that‚Äôs hurting Trump with his base isn‚Äôt the shutdown or the stalemate.  It‚Äôs that they were sold a bully but bought a weakling.
The trial of drug kingpin El Chapo shows how useless a wall would be in stopping drug trafficking https://www.businessinsider.com/el-chapo-trial-shows-a-wall-wont-stop-drugs-from-crossing-the-border-2019-1

The wall is a must
The wall is a symbol of fighting against socialism ... don't let drunk pelosi & nasty shumer ruin our wonderful country ... Build The Wall!!!

The wall is a waste of money, time, energy. It's useful only to feed an ego. Invests in technology and education.
The wall must be built what's wong with Chuck an  d  Nancy? Take the deal so our president could open up the government
The wall protects America. Why would ANYONE not want that?
The wall will do nothing you have to go to there tunnels and flush them out. The people coming to the wall are families and people trying to escape cartel.
The way Obama got Obama care was by lying his ass off an having the dumbocrats ram it down out throats,  "We have to pass it to know what's in it" says Pelosi.  That's the way he got Obamacare you dumb ass.
The way to deal with a bully is stand up to a bully. Cry all you want  Mr comb over, you ain't getting your wall.
Their are soooo many illagels here already does it help with that???? some are good others are very disrespectful they act like we owe them
Then do the national emergency an quit screwing around with these communist
Then hurry up!  Instill e-verify, build the wall, and deport every illegal here!
Then stop bowing to the Democrats and build the Wall, all this bullshit is making voters think the Democrats are starting to control President Trump to
Then stop talking about it and just Do it! Declare the Emergency, put up the wall and increase border safety and shove it up Nancy's senile nose....
Then stop this nonsense & caving in: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/19/donald-trump-offers-democrats-temporary-daca-amnesty-for-230-miles-of-wall/.
There ahould not be one Angel family
There ain‚Äôt gonna be no damn trump wall, so get over it!
There are already extensive fences and barriers along the border. A new ‚Äòwall‚Äô (that can be tunneled under, climbed over, and sawed through) will not stop illegal immigration. Most people who don‚Äôt have legal resident status work hard and pay taxes through their paychecks and on the products they buy, yet get no medicare or social security in return. Stop the fear-mongering and posturing. Cut the crap, forget about the pointless wall, and pass a budget that rebuilds US infrastructure and improves education.
There are many good words to say about Pelosi.  I just can't think of any right now.
There are many ways to fix the immigration system. You are unwilling to listen to all of the options you insist on a wall
There are more crimes committed by citizens than immigrants. Do you ever get your facts right?
There are more people who want a border wall then who do not! Immigrants who have come to this country do the front door want border walls. The only reason why the Democrats do not want a border wall is so that illegals can come here and vote Democrat so that they can turn this amazing country into a s******* socialist country. We need a civil war to make this stop
There have been no incidents of terrorists crossing the border, just being caught at the airport.  How are you so uninformed?
There is a legal process for entry into America.
There is a state under the name of sovereignty and does not own any sovereignty by groups led under darkness and injustice and the tyranny of your international and international human rights and the province of Basra disappeared from the month of September last and to this day against the in the aftermath of the government corrupt corruption and killed its people and killed has been killed since the start of the uprising The last 31 martyrs have been shot by the government and the tyranny of the era, and more than 300 injured outside, demanding the most basic rights water work electricity and there was no permission to hear, but there is repression and killing and arrests continued and liquids one after the other between activist and demonstrator and silence mouths demanding and urgent international nations and mother United immediate intervention kills and Basra slaughtered by the hands -ruled categorize inside under orders to outsource Iranian demand that immediately intervene between you ng people Basra killed and wounded and missed We demand from the President of the United Nations the salvation of this corrupt government, which arrests its people without cause and kills its people, while demanding the simple things for life, calling for the salvation of this government and the descent of the gaze under collective annihilation.
There is no doubt that Pelosi will reject the President's latest offer. That being the case I would:   Immediately proclaim a national crisis and get the military building barriers.  Secondly, I would let ICE loose. By that I would have them raid thousands of businesses and immediately deport any illegals found. As a nice measure I would give a 1 week notice that these raids are about to begin. Thirdly, along with deportation I would arrest either the hiring HR director, or if no one fits that description, arrest the front line supervision for hiring illegals.   Lastly, I would implement a 25% fee on ANY monies wired to Mexico and Central America.   If the President would implement a get tough program I would guess Pelosi would come begging to finally get this immigration issue solved once and for all. This crap needs to end.
There is no emergency except for an agent of Russia in the White House.
There is no solution for a viable affordable healthcare system in a country that has a 40% obese population.
There is nothing funny about this. The families deserve respect and know the American people care. Really? Someone is going to laugh when someone has been murdered? Murder in itself is illegal, illegal immigration is illegal. Everyone in government jobs will recieve back pay. You can't bring back the dead. You can only fight for the dead and realize that their life mattered.
There is nothing to fear but fear itself - FDR. Be afraid. Be very afraid - DJT
There is one reason Travis that Pelosi is in a high position and that's money.  Pelosi represents a very rich district and she is the best fundraiser in the Democratic party.  She makes the Democrats a ton of money so they keep her around.
There is really only a small percentage of Americans that support Trump.  Here is some real news: https://observer.com/2018/12/president-trump-really-may-go-to-jail-for-the-rest-of-his-life/President Trump Really May Go to Jail‚ÄîFor the Rest of His Lifeobserver.com
There should be a law forbidding shutting down the government.  Those in violation of this law should be removed from office and jailed.
There was already a deal. donnie didn't want it,  because it didn't give him the $5B that he needs to pay off the Russian oligarchs. Look towards the guy that owns the steel company that donnie has already chosen as his contractor.
There's a reason you aren't Europeans anymore. I see you still haven't learnt how to play nice with others?
There's a simple reason all you Republicans hate immigrants. You stole the country from its natural inhabitants and now you're afraid its going to be repeated lol :D
There's another Caravan coining 5,000 and behind that one there's another 7,000  when asked that they won't be allowed in the USA  just because they want a JOB THEIR ANSWER? WHOCARES.. NO RESPECT FOR AMERICA. DEPLOY 25,000 ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY CLOSE THE BORDER CUT TRADE. MEXICO IS HELPING THEM WITH BUSES.
There's no such thing as god :D sorry to burst your bubble. Like this wall, he's a creation of the rich to surpress a majority and control the fearful :D
These children are not locked up, they are living in a dormitory setting with beds, food, clothing and medical care.  They are being taken care of better than their own families who abandoned them.
These precious Angel Families have been through so much heartbreaking grief.  For Nancy Pelosi to refuse to meet with them is reprehensible.  AMERICAN Outrage against insubordinate Nancy Pelosi is justified everyday.
These students (1) are actually more mature than President Trump and that is not saying much. The students demonstrated that they are good at stare downs. Some have some decent dance moves. But, are they good at math, science, history? Can you put 'good at stare downs' on a job resume?  Do these young parasites represent the future of MAGA? BTW - the natives didn't stop with the expression of their history, but the boys face expulsion just as President Trump faces the likelihood of impeachment.

They are filing taxes I'm Indiana an other states with fake social security numbers getting over 10,000.00 back in taxes claiming over 10 kids in Mexico. An they don't even have kids. Stop giving our income tax money away. Build a wall. Stop the flow. Most American don't get but 3 thousand back in taxes. The Mexican are stealing our tax dollars in all lower state the proof is on whistle blower.
They are no more special than families of children murdered by anyone else. Their children are equally dead.
They are not going to give him the Wall , he'll have to build it without them !!!
They are trying to breed out the Conservative vote
They aren't.  üôÑ
They arent democrats they are reich brats, screwing healthcare as if under capitilism, as in the uk, blackmailing and issuing pharmeceutical death sentences to their own healthy troops and teens, gleefully monitering untill heads drop and legs stop functioning, with oclones, denes and drenes, and giving out tax payers cash to consume them, tax burning cynical wasters, they are the dangers to your society and doubtlessly statistically also, lets get some momentum here or many of us continue to be murdered in our homes, on the streets, in hospitals, police cells, forced into living dismal lives while the minted pull out their pockets, grind and beg, extort, sue, steal,and incinerate, from smarties to dollars, trees, pounds, shillings and cents, babies and dogs, and even your fence, some claim welfare, some live on the streets, others dress up as indians, lgbtq or slackers or pleats, these obstinate, adamant sensless screw ups relentless unappeasable and anti cognitive, head banging self perpetuating infinite lunacy BRATS lets lynch  Bernie Sanders for this is all that he stands for, and in europe the toxic brown shirts have turned to yellow, claiming false allegiance  to causes while burning your causes and murdering your futures and even your past. Aiming tclose your bank accounts and put you in credit agencies and soon you'll have to be borrowing against your wage with lunatic interest rates each week to be paid.
They don‚Äôt wear white hoods and sheets anymore.  They just call themselves Trump supporters.
They have been temporarily continuing for too long. Pass a real budget. No more resolutions to buy time cause it never gets done. We need all these losers out and fresh blood in there. At least Trump has new ideas and isn't politics as usual!
They have completely unhinged and gone rats ass crazy. The more they yell and scream about pro socialistic, pro  communists , anti rich ( even though Obama, Clintons, Pelosi and others have made a fortune being politicians )  Anti-White , Christian or Jews makes them more popular. Actually anything Un America is very popular with them . Most of all redistribution of wealth and more freebies and entitlements. It would be ideal  for them to take all the money from anyone who has anything and give it to the illegals and those that can never find a job. Fu*k the hard working well to do people that struggled to make it .  Open borders , free medical and education to illegals , while Americans have to work hard for a living and pay taxes. Almost all illegals work off the books and pay no taxes thereby get food stamps and many other benefits. Give it to the lazy ass useless and the illegals. Where are these people from? What‚Äôs more is that this sells air time and makes money for the fake news .
They have you on this one and it‚Äôs sad.  I never thought I would say that either.  You need to figure this one out.
They just don‚Äôt care about Americans, they just hate the Pres nothing else matters ,
They know it's the right thing to do....get rid if Soros and his money and that will take care of many problems with the Democrats.....

Things has to be done decently and in order. This was tacky, careless, cold hearted and heartlessly. Starting with tearing families apart leaving kids to defend for themselves. Granted, things has to be done for the border. Y at the cost to get what u want thru negative reinforcement? Bulling. Negative behavior NVR draws a positive response. U know this Trump! U understand the power of words and for u to go against what u said is the most humiliating thing for u to do. Ppl are suffering Trump. Heck, u are suffering. Do u not have health issues? Throw in the white towel already...

This Mexican lady also had 7 kids.  Not sure if they were all hers.  But.  We only had 2 because that‚Äôs all we could afford.  They want to flood the world with takers.  Not good

This has been with Clinton, Bush, & Obama  & Shame on Paul Ryan for not getting this done.. Why can't it go back to the bill passed by Republicans before dems came in?  Pelosi think she's running everything..She needs to get off her HIGH HORSE... & fixed this. They are blaming President Trump, but they have never done anything...STOP illegals coming into OUR country... A 1 page immigrant Law would help with this.   & STOP giving our money FREE to them.

This is a example why the democrats actions are reckless to this country especially California
This is a great message bc President Trump comes across to me, as caring, he‚Äôs polite and personable. This Angel Mom confirmed what I see. If I was in Pelosi chair, I‚Äôd set those ppl right in a hurry. She‚Äôs laying low, as they say. If this was Healthcare I‚Äôd be on the other side. js... I think we have to look üëÄ at this with fresh eyes üëÄ, open heart‚Äôs and mind‚Äôs. You have to do a deal, pass legislation, be present. You can‚Äôt deny a meeting when it‚Äôs your job. A woman who knows her power and uses it in the best interest of the situation, that‚Äôs a powerful woman who cannot be bought. Who is Nancy Pelosi ? As a person, I do not know??? She‚Äôs hiding.
This is about freedom...keep fighting trump.
This is actual banana republic  fake news.
This is all about Nancy pelosi and Chuck Schumer he could care less about the American people and the thousands that are out of work because of the shutdown this is a political pawn to them and the longer it goes on her no more likely I am getting reelected is 0
This is all about TRUMP.. so stagnation is coming cause this is a taste of the lefts obstruction.
This is all about getting President Trump‚Äôs high approval rating down. They can‚Äôt allow him to keep fulfilling his campaign promises. They don‚Äôt care about how many people die. They only care about the 2020 election and gaining control.  They are changing election laws as we speak on the local and state levels in order to gain seats.  We must stop these traitors once and for all!  Mr. President  We urge you to drain the swamp! We want JUSTICE!  We demand they pay for their crimes now!
This is an open and public letter to the duly elected president Donald J Trump, from William Sharpe, citizen of the United States of America.  Dear Mr. Pres. you are in a very unique position as president of the United States, whereas only three other presidents have been placed into this position throughout the history of our nation, James Madison, Abraham Lincoln, and John F. Kennedy, two of the three were assassinated as you well know.  James Madison was fighting for the survival of our nation during the war of 1812, Abraham Lincoln was fighting for the survival of our nation, through the Civil war of 1860,  and John F. Kennedy was assassinated before he could fight and save America from the same foes, that the formal two presidents and yourself know so well.  Mr. Pres. you are in a unique position to be in a minority of great presidents and great leaders, and your challenges are no less than the challenges that these president faced, and probably because of technology today your challenges may be greater.  Mr. Pres. we are at the pinnacle as a nation for survival, I don't think anyone needs to tell you this, but I will tell you that a majority of the American people stand behind you,, and are willing to sacrifice all to defend this nation from the tyranny coming from the Democratic party.  Mr. Pres. if we do not stop them here and now, we the American people will be forced into a unCivil War, and that is what these individuals want.  I would ask you to use the power granted to you by the office, to take these individuals involved in the destruction of our nation's Constitution laws our heritage our liberties and freedoms, into custody for trial as domestic terrorist, plotting the overthrow and destruction of the United States of America.  If we the people, common men like myself understand these things to be true and factual, we cannot wait any longer for our nation to be eroded away to be the equal of some substandard nation of crime and larceny.  The American people did not sacrifice their lives in all the battles and wars to defend this Republic to let it be taken away by pedophile, serial killers, rapist.and murderers, and we the people are ready and willing to stand with you and fellow countrymen to stop the destruction of our nation!  If we take these individuals in for trial now, we will have stopped the next violent Civil War in America!  Their public statements and actions prove without a shadow of a doubt that they stand against the American people, and have larceny and ill will in their heart for the will and safety of the American people.  Sincerely citizen William Sharpe of Delaware.
This is exactly what he's doing!!!
This is fake news, but so delicious! Tucker Carlson, Judge Pierro, Wilbur Ross, and Roger Stone   Cold Opening, SNL: https://youtu.be/Sld27PfAF3M

This is just one state where families will lose their hud/section 8 housing. All states have this help for families. Call your legislators to tell them to stop the shutdown. https://youtu.be/NZAsE-HDHx4
This is just the first one i came to. Now  you are a business guy. If you pit down one wall. That covers front yard. Will you keep your dog in if the other three walls are not there. But you know. Trump would understand that. You can just walk around this wall. Since car flow still going to go back and forth. So the failure not physically being able to check remains human. Need to find a better way. Try making where they come from better.   https://goo.gl/images/RN6ftF
This is literally fake news
This is not news.  You are quoting your daughter in law
This is now the Chuckles and Nonsensy shutdown. They refuse to negotiate, refuse to even discuss and debate, refuse to use the same rhetoric they used in 2013 that there is a crisis at the border. This is the Schummer Shakedown of the federal workers, and the Pelosi putdown of federal workers where she chooses illegals over their jobs.
This is on the Dems now they won‚Äôt vote to reopen the government because they don‚Äôt like President Trump and there still butt hurt he won the election Pelosi is the reason you won‚Äôt get paid give the American people what we voted for a safe country we need this wall
This is one of those areas that has been left out for a long time. We have had the border conversation so long, Pelosi and the the others don‚Äôt take it seriously. I was raised in Texas and when I was 14, I walked into the girls room at school, and there were 3 Hispanic males rapping a friend at knife point. Nothing is going to change as long as someone on this side is making money. You want the wall, you get those people out of the way.
This is state sponsored news just like North Korea üá∞üáµ brought to you by the dotard in chief
This is way too sad. Americans need to fight for America and it's people not everyone else 1st
This is what its all about. Yet the obstructionists on the left claim that its a manufactured crisis while ignoring the family members of relatives of people killed by illegals. Its just shameful.
This is what real leader are supposed  to  do  protect  the border from undesirable illegals. Ok
This is what the public should know but the Liberal in Washington, DC and the Media don't want you to know.  I ash America to put the Liberals out and back our President Trump in fighting for America not for the Liberals who are getting rich from US and built the WALL NOW
This is why I consider Trump someone who you can discuss with: he stopped Merkel! I didn't want to live in Germany and n e v e r would have voted for that bitch. But living in Germany also shows the wrong a wall can do...it's the reason we had (  thanks God h a d ) Merkel for so long who comes from behind the wall ( - a - w a l l ..- ) and therefor never learned to tell an X from a U! )
This isn't Trump's shut down, it's Putin's shut down.  Trump is doing Putin's bidding by crippling our society by its foundation.  Can't you see that Trump is tearing us apart by the seams, he divides us, propelling our young to animalistic hate.  Does this make you feel good?
This isn't Trump's wall!!!!   It's the USA's wall!!  It's MY wall!!  It's everyone that voted for Trump  wall.  Make it happen
This issue of border security has been compromised so many times in the past. Now is the time to take action. No more compromising Congress!
This lady and others lost there Children and there are ones on here with there laughing emoji ‚Äòs.  How sad and pathetic these people are who send these , not a laughing matter . You may not like the truth as it is told to you, or Our President but have some common decency
This letter is to President Donald Trump directly.   Our weapon laws have killed countless Americans.  If you care about women, you would arange stricter weapons laws  If you care about children, you would ban weapons.  If you care about stopping brutal crimes, you would arange stricter weapons laws  If you cared. You would arange stricter weapons laws  President Trump, this is a letter to you, as a parent, as a vather.  We have had enough. Protect the people you swore to represent. Protect our children. Protect our future.   WE WANT STRICTER WEAPONS CONTROLS. WE WANT IT NOW.

This morning I prayed that the Lord would deal with Nancy Pelosi (and others I named specially by name).  I asked Him to give her a short chance to change her heart or, if she will not change, to remove her.  The Word of God says to pray specific prayers.  It also says whatever we ask in Jesus‚Äô name we will receive.  I asked Him not to drag this out.  He will either remove her from office or from this world.  I believe with all my heart in prayer.  Pray the same, and join your prayer with mine.
This must suck for all of you liberal and Democrats out there today. Donald J. Trump, perhaps one of the greatest Presidents to not get any respect from the still butt hurt aforementioned because their 'queen' lost an unlosable election, is 1/2 way through his FIRST term. If you snowflakes would just get out of the way - like you told us to do when Barak Obama was President - we could fix some of the stuff that man screwed up. But no, the 'Party of Tolerance' will keep being intolerable. Nice to know you never practice what you preach, flip flop more than a beach sandal and hold a grudge like Bill Clinton does with interns.

This story is like building a wall in San Antonio
This whole thing is a perfect example of why Trump is not a great deal maker and never was. He was never a good business man even - he was given 250 billion by his father which if given to anyone who invested it would have been greater than Trumps net worth today, literally it would have taken no real effort.  Yet he also has declared bankruptcy for multiple business to avoid paying employees - just like government employees go without pay, that‚Äôs what happens when you work for this guy.  He tried to back out of the shutdown he declared he would be responsible for yesterday (it never should have happened as the budget is not a tool to manipulate policy). Alas he will fail with China as well, he may get a deal, but his deals are always bad, we will end up less empowered by his deal with China Paving the way for their rise and our demise. This is particularly problematic with the rise of what appears to be a new dictator in China. Be very careful to scrutinize whatever deal he ‚Äúgets‚Äù. When he says it‚Äôs great don‚Äôt be so quick to believe him, it‚Äôs your Children that will suffer the consequence.
This will help make Trump win in 2020..

Tim Stump I think it makes sense. Give them medicare and it would decrease the cost of Americans paying for them going to the emergency room.
Tim Stump don't forget that the reason insurance is increasing is because this administration has taken bits and pieces of it to the point it does not work the way its suppose to. With that being said the Republicans had two years to replace and fix those problems but they instead fought amongst themselves. I can sleep at night knowing that if someone needs assistance because they are sick we can help. Instead of blaming and being angry and fearful of people that come to this country for a better life why don't you focus your attention and the wealthy who are currently controlling this country and making it harder for the middleclass.

Tired of all this Collusion questions.  President Trump said himself  "I have never been more insulted by any question or statement "   well I really have to disagree I think Stormy Daniels said worse " He has a mushroom for a dick"  so it's toss up.  I don't understand why they make a big deal that DJT has met with Putin 5 times already and many times in private again I am less concerned with Collusion than I am of Penetration !!!  Putin has to be the pitching and Trump the catcher !!   Firm believer for a wall as it will get people working and there should be no interference from immigrants as they just entered Arizona via a Tunnel found too late.  I know the President is doing his best to end the Shut Down but Melania won't budge as she got on a military plane to Mar Lago  good for her.  Let's hang in there and continue to support the President, for me getting together with neighbors today to go down the Coast Guard Food Pantry setup so these kids and families can eat and save what they have saved for rent  elec etc.   After all these are the people that save lives at sea and confiscate most of the drugs trying to get into USA.

Today is my birthday 65 and I am so blessed to have a terrific President, out lived Obama care and I am healthy in spite of it! Don't forget to look in the mirror and say "Sherry's birthday wish is to have you as her President 4 more years"! To see secure  boarders secure with current employment laws followed, Human trafficking greatly curtained, Obamacare replaced, more and more Americans employed feeling the joy of working for the support of their families! Most of us get our news from other sources U,S, French and British news are as a fairytale for those that deny the facts before their eyes! Thank-you for a Great birthday!
Todd Cuson   That's a different problem with a different solution. Fact is, people cross the border illegally where no wall or barrier exists. It needs to stop completely NO more.

Trump and Republicans had $25 Billion for their wall last time but it wasn't good enough! Trump wanted Stephen Miller's (Fantasy) 4 point immigration plan that even most Republicans said was too extremist. Trump got himself into this mess by owning it and we aint saving him! Republicans in the Senate will have to fall on their swords to open the government by bucking Trump. Otherwise they can rot in hell till the next election.

Trump cares about America, democrats only care about their ‚Äúresist‚Äù agenda.
Trump cares about a few specific dead people who support his talking points, but the vast majority don't interest him. Like the people killed by people who need mental health care, the people killed by guns, the people who die because they can't afford their medicine, and so on.
Trump cares for all Americans! He is trying to put America first!I can see how much he loves this country God bless America and President Trump!
Trump caused this shut down and no one else he even said so.
Trump had to whip out his magic wand and show Berry how it was doneüòé
Trump has fucked your party in the ass and you guys are sure digging it.
Trump has pissed both sides off with his latest proposals. The right hate the fact he is talking about amnesty for the Dreamers. The left say it‚Äôs a nonstarter with Trump holding the government workers hostage.   His approval rating is now under 40%, a death sign for all Republican office holders. Not a good time to have a last name ending in Trump or being part of the Trump led cult.   The Trump bandwagon broke down many miles ago. It is sitting on the side of the road with broken wheels and flies buzzing all around. The buzzards are circling overhead, they are attracted by the smell political rot.
Trump has the balls to take the establishment on, where previous president‚Äôs didn‚Äôt.  Keep draining the swamp.  G
Trump is a POOR negotiator.  He tweets responses to tv host Ann Coulter over her criticism of him. He‚Äôs terrified of her .  Trump is a WIMP.   Trump works for Ann Coulter.  Not the American people.  Trump chooses to use the financial hardship of 800,000 Federal workers as PAWNS.   It‚Äôs like negotiating with a gun to their heads.
Trump is a bully and a liar, not good qualities in a leader
Trump is a complete and utter moron.....holds 100's of thousands of people hostage while he throws a temper tantrum...what a complete asshole
Trump is a cowardly grifter desperately trying to cover up his incompetence. He had two years to fix this without acting like a child but now it‚Äôs suddenly important to clean up a mess he created and pins on others (of course.) This is just trump‚Äôs last attempt at taking advantage of his supporters stupidity and fake patriotism. I haven‚Äôt heard anything new about infrastructure, healthcare or any other issue that‚Äôs important to the 95% of real Americans. Trump‚Äôs a cowardly third rate grifter and his supporters are morons.

Trump is doing an amazing job given the absolute retards that are opposing him across the isle.

How can this situation we are in be viewed as anything other than Nancy's fault. Pathetic!!

Trump is not holding federal employees as ransom.  illegal people should take the 3 years and then apply like all the legal immigrants had to do.  Why should the illegal people get free education, free housing, free food stamps, free health care and then brag on social media that they never worked a day in America?  Trump is exposing what has been going on for years.  The legal Americans should be getting some of these free programs.  Instead legal Americans are coming out of college with big student loans and debt WHILE the illegals DACA are coming out with $0 debt and loan.  Enough already.  Let President Trump do his job.
Trump is the best president since Abraham Lincoln!
Trump is the cause of the shutdown.  He had signaled McConnell he would sign the funding bills to keep the government open.  Then McConnell had the Senate vote - by voice vote. Very few, if any, ‚Äúnays‚Äù were said.  Then, extreme right media personalities criticized Trump.  Trump, revealing weakness, changed his mind in response to this criticism, leaving McConnell in a lurch.  Ryan changed the House bill to cover Trump‚Äôs changed opinion.  The House and Senate bills could not be reconciled - this was all right before the Christmas holiday.  Trump stated, on live TV, that he would be proud and happy to shut down the government. Trump also stated that he would own the shut down, completely.  I watched this on live TV. No fake news‚Äù spin involved.  The government shut down.  The new House passed the exact same bills as those the Senate had passed before Christmas.  McConnell will not bring those bills for a Senate vote again - he knows they would pass and would cause his party great stress.  The immoral and needless shut down is projecting much financial anxiety and pain onto over one MILLION Americans.  Trump is trying to bully in order to look strong in the face of criticism from media celebrities. He would rather hurt Americans than reject the media criticism.  The best way to handle a bully is to stand up to them. Else, they will continue to bully.  Trump is such a lousy negotiator that he relies upon hurting over one million Americans as bargaining chips, as hostages. That is IMMORAL.  I was registered GOP voter (back to Nixon) but have changed to independent as I no longer wanted to be associated with GOP once they had morphed into a group that places party before country- a situation that George Washington warned the country about in his Farewell Address.
Trump is the laughing stock of the world.
Trump is your president too, like it or not, we put up with Osama Obama for 8 years
Trump isn't a President. He's an idiot. He will always be an idiot.
Trump isn‚Äôt s leader at all. Let alone a global leader.
Trump looked to Russia as it carved up Ukraine, killed airline passengers, murdered dissidents and said, I want to build a skyscraper there with the Kremlin's help while I run for president. And he lied about it straight into the White House.   None of that's changed.

Trump lost the last election, his time is up.   What a moron.
Trump makes threats like a mob boss as 800,000 Federal workers can‚Äôt pay their mortgage, pay their rent, or buy their medications or feed their children. Meanwhile, Federal contractors are losing TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS a day. This is day 30 of what Trump claimed was his shutdown! Vicious, heartless bargaining chip on the lives of the American people! Trump is the National crisis! Trump is the National emergency! Resign!
Trump needs to put Pelosi on a plane with the victims mother's
Trump negotiated to help a million illegals - dreamers, yet it was still rejected.  How much is it costing to support a million illegals??? And it still isn't good enough. They oppose everything that Trump stands for, and not in the best  interest of the USA.
Trump offers a deal on immigration and shutdown, and it hits a wall
Trump on Twitter today! Wait what did he just post to the world?  I'm not the brightest bulb on the family Christmas tree, help me figure it out? Did he just defend his "beautiful, see through steel slat" taxpayer funded construction project by citing Hispanic poll numbers rising ?! Wait what? That's all he has to sell and defend this 5.7 $ expense to the American taxpayers, not paying his own employees, our federal employees,  is saying the Hispanic numbers are up and they would know best?  What ? This is where we are at?  Open the Government!  https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1086987568074424320
Trump pledges to continue to victimize "Angel" families by using their pain for politics...Disgusting
Trump said he made a pledge to Angles Families. Was that pledge anything like what he said about the Gold Star Family Khan or the Gold Star Family that Trump said " he knew what he was getting into, when he signed up ".
Trump should deliver his state of the union address like he and others have done in the past - after all he is the president
Trump should have a sit down with El Chappo. He would perhaps find it educational except Trump would likely ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù with him as he did Kim Jong Il. It‚Äôs always the worst of the worst who impress Trump the most.
Trump shouldn‚Äôt have to fight for border security - it is the only decent thing to do. Pelosi is immoral and I believe she drinks too much. She does not serve the people - she only serves the illegals and criminals.
Trump sucks! end of story. idiot & thief.
Trump supporters. Your lack of knowledge is incredible. Do you read?
Trump takes DACA kids hostage about his foolish wall. Americans not getting paid those that protect us TSA and coast guard  while he has a tantrum, why hurt Americans over a wall he said Mexico is paying

HOW ABOUT YOU PAY FOR IT.. YOU HAVE FAR MORE MONEY THAN THE POOR FED WORKERS YOU FURLOUGHED !!!!!
Trump to Mexico: Climb my wall and you get to stay #AmnestyDon
Trump tweet: "To have a little of that good old fashioned global warming right now." This is the president of the United States. Mocking global warming. First of all: this is a weather event less than a month into the winter? Hello? Plus: do you understand science? You are a clear and present danger to my grandchildren. What a jackass. And folks, spare me the "cycle" bullshit, because that is nonsense. Greenland is melting now.  Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tons of ice since 1970. Ocean at record warmth. Forest dying from excessive heat/ocean pH dropping.  Fish species disappearing. ‚ÄúBe careful and try staying in your house,‚Äù the president tweeted. ‚ÄúLarge parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn‚Äôt be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right.

Trump, why did you confiscate the translators notes?  Did you destroy them?  Why did you order the translator not to speak with anyone from your staff?  Why did you not have any members of your staff or other American officials present during your meeting with Putin in Helsinki?  Are you in debt to or being manipulated by the Russians?  Did you direct Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump tower?  Why are you attempting to ease sanctions on Russian Oligarchs? Stopped by bi-partisan Congressional efforts.  Why do you continue to act like an asset of Russia?

Trump=Capitalists and socialism Left=Communists. Communists never have a socialist plan and set out to destroy all democratic progress. 100 million people died under communist dictatorships. Marx=cousin to the bankers 1%
Trump`s so-called fighting has only created a major crisis at our southern border....Now he is trying to use "Angel Families" to correct the crisis HE created....It takes a special type of low-life like Trump to do something like that low...
Trumpaganda even on a Sunday!  LIAR
Trumplins set up a GoFundMe for the barrier.üòä
Trumps an asshole
Trumps fake campaign promise and his rigged agenda to walk away form a comprehensive deal on immigration. By waiting 2 years to create a shutdown to blame democrats and to continue to distract from the Russian rigged agenda, and the campaigns conspiracy to collude to confuse
Trumpturds... Go to church and ask God for forgiveness for the sin of treason against your country. Then ask your fellow Americans for forgiveness. Afterward denounce Trump. It's the right thing to do.
Trumpty Dumpty built a great Wall! Trumpty Dumpty had a great fall! All of the right wing and crazy men couldn't put Trumpty together again!

Trump‚Äôs Slippage in Support is Real  The slippage is the worst kind‚Äîthe slow erosion of support from key blocs: swing voters (independents and suburbanites) and those who put Trump over the top (blue collar white men and Republicans over 60).  It‚Äôs been registering in a cross section of polling data, not just one poll. Trump‚Äôs job approval rating is down to 31 percent among independents in Gallup. His approval ratings in Rasmussen are down from the 48-49 percent range of late last year to the 43-44 percent level of the past week or so. The Marist data for PBS shows a drop of 10 percent in job approval among Republicans and a decline of 11 percent among white evangelicals and 17% among suburban men.  And Trump continues to enrage the Dem base while this erosion in his base continues to progress. Blue collar white men being turned off from Trump shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone, for they know the difficulty of living paycheck to paycheck. This, plus the skew of the tax cut package, spells political trouble for Trump long term, especially if a slow down, much less a recession, looms in 2020.  Bulwark

Try fixing the IMMIGRATION POLICY itself.
Try spelling lessons.
Trying to twist it to Steven you are sick
Tuesday AM,first thing, issue ex order to open government. Mitch McConnell and Republicans plus enough Democrats will pass bill. What happens in the house will justify your efforts.  We support you!
Tunde Lakatos 1) i have the right to post to The President of USA cuz i am also US Citizen.  2) costa rica and USA has exactly the same issue with immigration. This country has people from Nicaragua, Colombia and Venezuela immigrating to CR as illegals. So i Understand Trumps position of immigration. 3) I have a good point to ask something that he promise in campaign.
Tunde Lakatos Alas, he is my president. Yours too. I have no intention of shutting up. If you don't free speech, leave.
Tunde Lakatos I dreamt I was in Hosok Tere. I overheard 7 guys talking. They were saying what a cowardly asshole trump is! Gotta agree!
Tunde Lakatos This wall is to segregate!  Just like the Berlin wall it has been sold to people in a scare method to solve a problem that it will not address and only cause isolationism and segregation.  If you truly want to address the drug problem, you should look at our ports, airports and the border were trucks are passing inspection and flooding our country.  If you truly want to weed out the de minimus amount of truly bad immigrants look elsewhere because they aren't crossing the border illegally.  If you want to address terrorists attempting to come into this country, look at the airports and marine vessels.  You might want to look at Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia as well.  Documented that the preponderance of terrorists are from those countries.  I understand you think Saudi Arabia is our friend and ally. That women and children walking hundreds of miles to escape political and gender discrimination are the enemy. I understand because Donald J. Trump told you to believe.
Tunde Lakatos he will try to deport you too.
Tunde Lakatos if he walks like a duck and he talks like a duck....for ‚Äúd‚Äùucks sake...
Tunde Lakatos what part of Hungary are you from?
Turn off the TV, dumbass. You morons are insanely gullible and stupid.
Tweeto doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results. The very definition of insanity.
Two Years In, The Republican Party Faces An Uncertain Future In Trump‚Äôs Image https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-gop-face_us_5c425823e4b0a8dbe171600b
Two legs good, four legs ba-a-a-ad.
Two more caravans on the way . Someone is funding them and need to be prosecuted. Millions estimated to arrive on open field this year according to Spanish media last year.
Two years ago you became the best President of my lifetime, President Trump. Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to put Americans first.
Two years ago, I was at the Inauguration of the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump. The train going into DC was delayed on the tracks. We were told that there was a problem ahead, but that it would be taken care of ASAP. I remembered how I had read of a threat from ANTIFA - that they would block the tracks leading to the Capital, and I wondered. Arriving at street level, all that could be seen were masses of people - lines upon lines of people - winding around every block and down every street, as far as the eye could see. The lines were incredibly slow. Each person had to go through tight security prior to entering the mall area. College age people kept trying to push their way through. I blocked many of them as I suspected who they were. A story filtered through the crowd that security checkpoints were being blocked by ANTIFA protesters. I realized that much of the ceremony might be missed by just staying in line and blocking ANTIFA one at a time, so I walked many blocks laterally to reenter the line close to an open checkpoint. Arriving on the Mall, the air was electric! People were ignited with joy! As President Trump spoke, the atmosphere itself changed, and the sun burned through the threatening sky. The spirit shifted. I'm not talking about what was happening in people's hearts. There was an actual change in the air - as if it had been cleansed and released. There was a palpable change in the spiritual authority over Washington. As soon as our new President was done speaking, I rushed to the parade route on Pennsylvania Avenue, only to be greeted by more security lines and checkpoints.  Blessedly, I got through in time, and was given an unexpected seat at the top of some bleachers. There was a great commotion about two blocks up, and there were DC police, military equipment, fire engines, helicopters, and Army personnel everywhere. It turned out that Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA were rioting only two blocks from where I was. The rioters and their supporters who were not apprehended, moved to the area next to our bleachers! They began chanting, yelling, and disrupting. I couldn't stand it! How dare they steal the joy of our day? I started answering each of their chants with a counter chant, and the rest of the people on the bleachers joined in! The Army presence increased around us and the police lining the street began to appear nervous. The rioters started chanting "Black lives matter", so we shouted them down with "Police lives matter". As we did that, the police relaxed and became friendly toward we, the bleacher people. The Army dispersed, and the protestors quieted. Unfortunately, President and Mrs. Trump did not walk past where we were. They rode by in the Beast. I'm sure our "battle" and the riot two blocks away caused that. As I watched his car drive past, I heard a warning. "The weapon that they will use against him, is to try and separate him from the people, to isolate him". How true that prophesy has been. Praise God, they have not succeeded. Thank you President Trump. May God go with you, and may you go with God.

U.S. citizens with guns kill more people, but all you‚Äôve got for them is ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù. Why aren‚Äôt the families of school shooting victims ‚ÄúAngel Families‚Äù? What about the families of all victims of all the shootings that occur every single day, regardless of the citizenship of whoever kills them?  Truth is, you have no more sympathy for these families than you do for anybody else. They are just pawns in your ongoing power play.
UNITED BIKERS FOR TRUMP
USA Tax payers have been financing their very own demise. STOP doing that. Start by confiscating George Soros asset and his dark money and deport him, his family, his supporters and beneficiaries if you wish to keep your country.
Uh you also promised us Killary would go to jail and that has not happened either. I am beginning to wonder just who did I vote for !
Uh...I don't think Italy will have to come up with the money.  Stay in your own lane. :-)
Ukraine mulls cooperation with ConverDyn for construction of conversion plant project A private U.S. nuclear energy company could begin helping Ukraine in the production of enriched uranium, the fuel in nuclear power plants, according to a statement on Thursday (July 2) from Kiev's nuclear authority, Yadernoye Toplivo. The meeting, which took place on June 23 in Kiev between ConverDyn external link and Ukrainian officials, is another indication of Kiev's attempts to diversify its future energy needs and distance itself from Russian-produced energy, reports pro-Ukrainian news website UNIAN. "At present, ConverDyn is interested in cooperation with Ukrainian companies in the field of uranium conversion services for Ukraine‚Äôs nuclear energy industry," the official statement reads. "During the meeting, the parties discussed the potential possibility of jointly building the uranium hexafluoride production facilities in Ukraine." (International Business Times July 3, 2015)
Ulrike Hoffmann-Tanner that's what they wanted him to do so they could of used unconstitutional laws they created in 1878 just 13 years after they had our 16th president killed and their only regret is they didn't do it 28 years sooner so we would of had a different 16th president.
Um, just open the Government and continue to negotiate.  Duh.
Umm... pass it then we will read it...duh... dumbocare SHOVED down Americans throat
Ummm....I don't think drywall is going to keep out "the brownies".
Unbelievable, what‚Äôs going on with the DIMMS and RINOS preventing the sovereignty of our nation because of their allegiances to the globalist billionaires and Corporations!  We as a nation are under attack by nefarious forces from the criminal empires to foreign governments.  So, what does this call for in full force is for President Trump to even further his resolve by acting without hesitation in using the Executive Branch to secure our borders, and charge those involved in sedition and treason!
Under the new dems/socialism, Americans no longer need passports, IDs of any kind since they care only for illegals who have none of those.  If the world's masses can walk across our borders without documentation, than we too shouldn't carry IDs for travel, benefits, etc. or is this luxury just for everyone except taxpayers?
United States does not negotiate with terrorism.  Donald Trump is a terrorist holding this country hostage for f $5.7 billion.  Don‚Äôt give in to this motherfuckers demands.
Unless Ginsberg shows herselF to be functioning  our elected President needs to chose a 'ninth'  Conservative Supreme court judge, Wouldn't that would be a hoot ., re: Ninth circuit court who Democrats use to block every needed change..we need tended to..He can and while we have Senate (nuclear) .

Until Donald became President, it had never been 2019 before. Bless our President!

Victoria A. Deobald  That's interesting considering she doesn't support Israel and she supports all the reasons 9/11 happened.
Victoria A. Deobald / Riiiight. Off your meds again? Canadian troll bait
Victoria A. Deobald A Pioneer from the former Soviet Union!
Victoria A. Deobald I agree that there was more to 9/11 than we will ever know. Trump is hardly going to reinvestigate to of his backers
Victoria A. Deobald I thought you republicans love Israel. FYI, Israel has terrorist lobbing explosives into Israel. We don't have terrorists lobbing explosives over the boarder. That is a piss poor argument.
Victoria A. Deobald Trump's handler is part of the Soviet Union, like you Vika.
Victoria A. Deobald how you know this
Victoria A. Deobald what on Earth is the matter with you people seriously I don't listen I mean you do but only to the idiot who doesn't bother to like know anything or check facts or any of those cool things before he speaks. Seriously Trump can't expose anyone for anything because it would require paying attention to someone other then himself. Aslo Trudeau is a self admitted globalist. Try paying attention next time
Victoria A. Deobald you need better meds...

Wasn't Mexico supposed to pay for the wall
Wasn‚Äôt a problem when republicans controlled both houses for the first two years of your presidency. Hmmm.
Watched Nancy's remarks last night on our local news station TV10. Still unwilling to work with the President in any manner!!!  Words out of her own mouth last night on national TV  was ( I DON'T WANT THE WALL,. I DON'T WANT THE WALL,. I DON'T WANT THE WALL,. ) So there you have it. Nancy don't want the wall. The shutdown will stand . Thank you to Nancy and Chuck and other DEMOCRATS ! For hating President Trump so deep you willing to hurt the American people!!!
Watched a fascinating program about you recently
Water has been stolen from third world countries?

Way to go, Mr. President, shining a flashlight on the cockroaches Pelosi and Schumer.  They don‚Äôt give a damn about Americans or DACA kids.  Greed, power and the votes.  They are exposed for the trash they are.  We see them!!!!!!
Wayne Alexander White  who is your President You must not be living in America as a citizen Rofl but then I‚Äôm betting you voted for Hillary so that explains a lot about you
Wayne Elam Jr. $150 billion that was already Iran's money held under sanctions. FYI, the money sent to Iran was from weapons that Reagan sold them to fund his illegal Central American death squad but he only delivered half of the weapons he sold to the known terrorist nation. Look up Iran/Contra and stop being such a gullible dupe. Turn off Hannity and Rush, the two uneducated ex-dj's.
Wayne Piercy you should probably take a class in government.....US!

We all no why demacrats won't work with Mr President Trump üá±üá∑ they want to keep the drugs flowing to keep people hooked to keep them down that's how they get there votes by blaming Republicans for there problems ... build the wall Mr President Trump üá±üá∑ please don't back down ....start A mass deporting of all illeagls and see how fast they come to the table ...
We already have a we the people petition and have raised over 20 million and it‚Äôs going strong.
We already know you illegals want Trump impeached. Go home and fix your country lazy mf
We are all grateful for President Trump‚Äôs efforts and commitment to securing our borders....... just think of the positive effect this will have on reducing drug availability throughout the United States. We can‚Äôt surrender in the war on drugs.
We are all victims now aren't we? We have one branch of government, the executive, the potus, refusing to pay his employees, our federal workers, to force our  other co-equal branch of government, (Nancy is the lead speaker of the house of it)!  one branch can't force the other to do things! our president has shutdown our govt, created a crisis right here, right now, trying to force his demands for 5.7 in taxpayer$ for construction funding! #OpentheGovernmentNow!
We are behind you 100% President Trump üá∫üá∏. It's about time a President of the USA puts AMERICA FIRST!  Stay the course and don't let those lying cheating democrats take you off course! We see and understand the lies they are telling and we aren't buying it. We see their numbers don't add up. You are right with all the drugs and human trafficking that goes on with illegals we MUST do something and NOW is the time. Stay the course.
We are counting on YOU TO BUILD OUR WALL!
We are making a pledge to impeach and imprison you asswipe
We are making a promise to you no dam wall. Mexico is bringing you one
We are not free slaves now
We are with you President Trump!
We are with you all of the way!!!
We can not jeopardize homeland security while waiting to fund the wall.  Support the homeland defense workers ,  they are our first line of protection in the U.S.   Coast Guard,  TSA....
We could spend 5 billion on domestic violence prevention/education and programs to help women get out of abusive relationships without being murdered; veteran programs that actually meet the needs of our vets (mental health/medical care/housing/job training); drug prevention and rehabilitation programs in high poverty areas. There are so many things that wall money could be used for to stop Americans from dying.
We do NOT want a wall. More boarder security NOT a wall.
We do want save boarders, but spending g money on a wall will not keep the terrorists out. In case no one has mentioned it, we welcome legal migration here in the US. Fix the system. Hire more people. People will come here legally if the system is safe, efficient, and effective. We need workers!
We don't want a wall.  Put resources into crossing facilities. .. and RESIGN
We dont need a wall never had one.
We don‚Äôt need a wall. The majority of American don‚Äôt believe we need it. Time for you to give up Trump. #TrumpLies
We don‚Äôt want a wall!!
We don‚Äôt want a wall. Join the modern age. Walls are useless
We don‚Äôt want a wall. We are all for secure boarders but once again we need to do it in a way that will be more efficient and less expensive. There is a reason we have technology... walls don‚Äôt work.
We don‚Äôt want you or that stupid fucking wall ü§¢
We don‚Äôt want your fucking wall, open the government
We don‚Äôt want/need an ineffective wall, but we do want comprehensive immigration reform, and more border security using technology, training, and SOME physical barriers where appropriate.  Reopen the govt. now and work on it.  Quit using 800,000 federal workers as pawns.
We don‚Äôt!
We have a great President!! I thank God for him!!
We have for a long time.
We have to fight against Islam
We have to many illegals in our country. Working low qualification/manual labor jobs citizens could be working. Theyre hired because theyll work for less. This depresses wages in the entire area if high pops of them reside there. They get any type aid the state/county offers the same way they fraudulently get jobs, using stolen identities. These programs were meant for citizens truly in need. Not illegals here adding it in to their income. This needs to stop.  #deportallillegals
We heard you speech yesterday President Trump and once again, you were right on.  I'm delighted that you canceled the Dems trip abroad.  They need to stay home in this greatest country on earth and assist you in solving the southern border crisis, AND IT IS A CRISIS ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.

We must change or stop this from happening by securing the border.
We need a wall to protect patrols who work in dangerous territory.
We need an open fire policy at the border.
We need barriers of some type in more areas, Nancy.  Four more American citizens dead because of one illegal immigrant.  Wake up, grow up and start thinking of the U.S. citizens instead of your own selfish fears of irritating your socialist congressmen and women.
We need border peotection, smaller governmrnt,  and to be prepared for bigger stuff coming.
We need illegals deported just as, if not more so than the wall.
We need protection from morons like this ^^^^^ >:(
We need the damn wall up put it up or close the border.
We need the wall
We need the wall Nancy
We need the wall and healthcare reform!!!!!!
We need the wall because Mexico president is letting everybody in he has open border

We need to deport Democrats. we need to open the government. We need to protect the Border. And you mr. President keep doing the right work .üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏MAGA 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
We need to fix our broken Democrats too.
We need to get rid of welfare.food stamps  , subsidies on housing,wic ...get a job and pay for yourself....the the people that work every day are tired of supporting all these people....use that money it more the enough to pay for the wall and to make America great again ...Americans can have free education and medical for all the money we give away to people who don't work  ...make them work like the rest of us...I dont work my Bill's dont get paid it's that simple
We need to put the money where your heart is . Here in America‚ù§
We need to re-brand Mr. Fibb's slogan of "Make America Great Again" into "Hugs from Thugs"... Admittedly,he will sell out the will of the majority of country for $5.7B....take hostage a whole level of or workforce and not even mention them, create crisis and then take credit for fixing the crisis, and he will sell us out abroad... All it takes is an admiration letter or say you admire him. Aren't you glad you don't live in a dictator country where they can make you disappear, execute you, or starve you to death, deny you your legal rights??? America help feed those that are unpaid, unable to go to work population and thrive.. don't let the hostages suffer..give all you can, if you can..
We need to vote on our congressman aswell
We really need to get this FAKE  NEWS propaganda mill taken down.
We see what's going on the Democrats have no intention of protecting the American people. They only protect the illegal aliens that vote for them.
We seem to loose no matter which party is in control Bob. By "we", I mean the average, working class people. I'm fed up with all of them in Washington.
We send a lot of money to other countries Why can't we secure our own borders??????
We should use the seized drug money to build the wall legalize marijuana and tax it federally to pay the people working at the wall and to maintain it
We stand with you Mr President.
We stand with you President #Trump and am praying for you! God bless!

We support you, Mr. President!
We tell Nancy to build the wall.  But unlike God, SHE does not listen.

We the people want our wall.
We told her about the wall she forgets due her Dementia
We true Americans are behind you 1000%, Mr. President!
We want people to respect our laws. Especially pill-osi.
We want the Wall
We want the Wall but the Dems don't look like they care what we want or what's best for our Country.  These people should not be in office. They are acting so childish and petty. I say we get rid of them and replace with more reasonable people!
We want the the wall
We want the wall
We want the wall  open the government
We want the wall ASAP Nancy
We want the wall Nancy,not what you want what W E. Want,
We want the wall and all other security to strengthen the borders.
We want the wall and get this shut down settled
We want the wall and more....
We want the wall!
We want the wall! Law and order üôèüèª
We want the wall!!
We want the wall, so Americans can feel safe.  Thank you Mr. President for standing firm on that.
We want the wall. Build it!!!
We want the wall. We want legal entry.
We want the wall.and stop the invasion of our country!!!!!
We want you out !!!!
We want you, and people like you, to stop hiring illegals. That will solve the problem immediately.
We will gladly put up a wall if it‚Äôs around and the whole trump crime family.
We ‚Äòre telling YOU we want that damn wall!
We're also allowed to SHOOT intruders.  Too many liberals and bleeding hearts. Ohh just tap their hands,  say don't do that,  and let them go. What a joke.
We're done with Traitor Pelosi.  What's our next move?
We're standing firm with you, Mr. President.  We're unwavering like you Mr. President.
We're telling you to restart the government...no one asked you to sacrifice American security just to get your way like a spoiled brat
We're with you.
We, the MAJORITY of the People, do NOT stand with you!
We, the People, agree that we need to "fix our broken immigration system"  However, We, the People, will NOT tell Nancy we want the wall.  We, the People are telling YOU we only want the wall that is funded IN ADVANCE by Mexico. Our money should not be spent on an ineffective wall that can be dug under, climbed over or flown over or that can have drones flown over.     A better use of our money would be to create jobs by increasing Border Patrol agents and the staff to process refugees.
We, the ppl are with you!!! #MAGA
Webster Lynn Vi Cutting and pasting again Natasha?
Webster Lynn Vi I promise I will not spend a dime on it. I will personally see to that.  He promised he would have Mexico pay for it and you voted for him...you pay for it ! If you really think a wall will keep them out you are part of the problem. Mexicans are not carrying millions of drugs on their back.  They are coming in planes, car and boats. How is a freaking wall gonna stop that.  A waste of your MONEY
Webster Lynn Vi Oh shut up! Where is the proof!
Webster Lynn Vi The democrats would still have a problem if Trump solved world hunger
Webster Lynn Vi but the wall won‚Äôt keep stop most illegal immigration- mist fly in and overstay visas. I would rather our taxpayer dollars to sorting that out than building a silly wall that people can tunnel under, cut or climb over.
Webster Lynn Vi yep!
Webster Lynn Vi üòêüòêüòêüòê
Webster Lynn Vi. You're making no sense.
Well America was a socialist country in the 1950s with a tax rate of 70-91% for the richest
Well Jerry I suppose a Moron Don supporter would know uninformed when they spot it? You have a lot of practice watching Donnie Boy :D I'll bow to your expert opinion
Well John Wheeler that‚Äôs on Chucky and Nancy as they both voted on a wall several times and both have walls around their MULTIMILLION dollar estates however NOW the wall is immoral !?! REALLY?!  Do you have a fence/ Barrier in your back yard John !?! Do you lock your doors at night or when you leave , of course not as that would be moronic and irresponsible ...just like chucky and Nancy are being now !! It‚Äôs not a rubix cube Johnny baby !! üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
Well clearly you can be this stupid, but I really want to give you the benefit of the doubt.
Well done to the president, definitely right...
Well how about telling the President to stop babying the Dems. Open up the government and put a freeze on all spending and hiring.  Close ALL THE borders until the immigration laws are changed by congress and start DEPORTING everyone who is here illegally.
Well how does that happen? :o
Well if they want to they can dig under it like boarder patrol has pictures of. Or they can over stay a vacation visa to your back yard BBQ.
Well kenna Evans I am actually far from arrogant maybe you read me wrong because I'm something foreign to your reflection..sorry you obviously are easily misguided and know nothing of my house is and always has been clean in even mind body etc . which is why you lead your conversation with insults and that is fine . it is obvious your not equipt to be judging or solving any life ..national security or political crisis either .. And I love lemons
Well said Gary
Well sure has shut down the TSA , US Coast Guard , soon ATC housing development , EPA, National Parks etc etc etc nice job on dumb ass increasing security for your borders üòÉüòÉ pure Insanity . What else would you expect from No 45 . üëç
Well trump...you didn't fix snything...and fuker up just about everything...shithead
Well we know Donald Trump is our President not Nancy Pelosi.
Well you've been talking wall two plus years and still no wall. The Dems are not going to agree with ANYTHING if it includes wall funding. If  Pelosi's entire family were murdered in front of her by illegals she will not support a wall. This is all about Dems staying in power nothing less. Trump will only get the wall by circumventing the house. His entire presidency rests on this issue. So far we're getting BLAHBLAHBLAH while we are being slaughtered. It will be too bad if we have to resort to other means to protect ourselves because that will be literally opening Pandora's box...
Well your presidency is narrowing so better hurry up !!!!!!
Well, please don't stop there.  After the border wall, there's still an utterly ineffective Congress that refuses to acknowledge, much less offer a real solution for, the broken immigration system that Congress itself created.
Well, then start by making e-verify mandatory and disband DACA, which has already been deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge years ago.
Well...  STOP THE INVADERS BEFORE THEY CROSS OUR BOARDER.
Welllll...... You're failing. Worst president in U.S. history.  LOCK HIM UP!!!
Wendy Anne it so nice to see people with an extra chromosome participating in the comments.  üòä

We‚Äôre just at the 30 Day mark of the government shutdown. Once that happens, President Trump can get rid of or downsize departments & programs that waste our money and resources through Fraud and Abuse:  Government investigators and private watchdog groups uncover fraud and abuse in the federal budget on a regular basis. There are three common problems: ineligible individuals and businesses receiving benefits, bureaucrats who abuse the public trust and members of Congress who abuse their privileges for private or political gain. In the first type of problem, fraud artists are attracted to the government because there are billions of dollars in contracts and grants to take advantage of. Here are some examples uncovered by the GAO and other investigators in recent years: ‚óè Medicare. Erroneous and fraudulent payments to Medicare providers cost $20 billion annually. The program is vulnerable to an array of different scams such as inflated billings, claims for phantom patients and phantom procedures, and billings for services that are not supposed to be covered. The fraud goes on year after year and Medicare administrators are unwilling or unable to stop it. Experts are predicting that the huge new Medicare prescription drug plan will be particularly susceptible to fraud and abuse. ‚óè Medicaid. As with Medicare, inflated billings and bogus claims under Medicaid, waste billions of dollars each year. The GAO found $1 billion of fraud in California‚Äôs portion of Medicaid alone. After a year-long investigation, the New York Times reported in 2005 that from 10 to 40 percent of the state‚Äôs annual Medicaid budget of $45 billion may be siphoned off in fraud and abuse. The paper found that outrageously bold rip-offs have proliferated due to the indifference of New York and federal policymakers. ‚óèMedicaid-Nursing Home Benefits. These benefits are supposed to be for the poor, but financial consultants help higher-income seniors hide their assets in order to qualify. This scam imposes $10 billion in extra costs on taxpayers each year. ‚óè Post-9/11 Grants #1 Much of an $8 billion federal program to help repair damaged New York offices near Ground Zero ended up going to build luxury condos and to projects outside Lower Manhattan. ‚óè Post-9/11 Grants #2 A federal program to hand out free air conditioners to New Yorkers affected by the collapse of the World Trade Center ballooned in cost from $15 million to $100 million because of management failures and bogus claims. ‚óè Housing Subsidies. Overpayments in federal rental housing subsidies cost $2 billion each year. ‚óèHeadStart. This $7 billion program is rife with misuse of funds.  ‚óè Social Security. Social Security pays out about $1 billion in fraudulent disability benefits each year. ‚óè Farm Subsidies. The Department of Agriculture pays out millions of dollars‚Äîperhaps as much as half a billion dollars‚Äîof improper farm subsidies each year. ‚óè Food Stamps. This program pays out about $1 billion annually in erroneous and fraudulent benefits, although problems have been reduced in recent years. ‚óè Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA has a reputation for being sloppy with its disaster aid. It tends to hand out money indiscriminately after hurricanes and other disasters, and it loses millions of dollars to fraud because of its poor management. ‚óè Earned Income Tax Credit. Almost one-third of EITC payments‚Äîabout $9 billion annually‚Äîare erroneous or fraudulent.
We‚Äôre w/ you Pres.!
We‚Äôre with you! Government employees can draw on their 401ks tax free during a shutdown and pay it back out of their back pay. Also they should plan for these shutdowns and have at least a 6 month nest egg saved. Keep it shut until immigration is FIXED! #CONGRESSDOYOURJOBS!
What % of violent crimes are committed by immigrants?  I'll wait while you research the answer to this dog whistle  *files nails*
What I really want is for you to issue an executive order (or file a case with the judicial system) that halts Congress' paychecks during any government shutdown!
What I want is Donald Trump to develop a basic understanding of the pros and cons of erecting additional barriers along the southern border. It is easy to repeat what you have said in the past, instead of developing that understanding. If you can be educated, start to try to understand what will be required to ensure border security - instead of spending millions of tax-payer money on a worthless campaign primise that will never achieve the objective.
What Pelosi is not telling you is that 81,500 migrants were released into our communities in "Oct. & Nov. alone".    Oct. SW Border Total  Apprehensions       50,975 Inadmissibles           9,770 Admitted to U.S.    41,205  Nov. SW Border Total  Apprehensions       51,856 Inadmissibles         10,600 Admitted to U.S.     40,256  https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration
What a SHAM!
What a bunch of crock. Fix something that is actually broken like Russia‚Äôs influences in the WH and all the lies that comes out of there. Break those ties!
What a clown
What a great time for the shutdown and Dr. Kings words fill the air. Listen to a man that obeyed his conscience
What a joke of a president you shut down the government now people like myself can‚Äôt get paid what a clown ü§°
What a moron!
What a total loser
What about a pledge to the 6 to 7 thousands workers killed on the job every year where you lifted Obama‚Äôs safety regulations to keep employees safe and hold corporations responsible?  What about a pledge to those killed by collapsing bridges because you don‚Äôt put money in infrastructure but massive life long tax breaks for you and your buddies?
What about all of the families that have lost children to gun violence?  Why not focus on that policy making?  Oh, yeah, that‚Äôs right....
What about all the lives lost I. These mass shootings that have taken place in movie theaters, concerts, high schools and elementary schools, colleges, churches and bars. ALL COMMITTED BY WHITE MALE Americans!!! Why doesn‚Äôt he EVER talk about that?! He talks about the officer that was killed by an illegal immigrant the day after Christmas. But has he even spoken of the Officer Natalie Corona only 23 years old who was shot and killed two days later by a white man who was American?! Why hasn‚Äôt he addressed that? Because it contradicts everything he stands for! This nation is built on imagination! His own grandparents are immigrants! But of course they are the right color of immigrants. This is indigenous land!! Yet he makes every white person feel entitled to treat anyone of color horrible. Just like those horrible kids mocking a Native American veteran out of pure hate. That‚Äôs is what this man is doing to our country. He is filling it with hatred.
What about all the people murdered everyday by our own citizens... mass shootings... their lives were also stolen by oor own citizens ...they matter just as much as these Angel families... these people aren‚Äôt anymore special than others that have been murdered...
What about all the white me whom kill in schools ...?  This is political propaganda..no all Undocumented people are criminals...
What about all those 1000‚Äôs of people dying daily from drug overdoses ?
What about all those families impacted my good old American born killers with guns?
What about gun control?
What about gun violence.  Ohhhh right mass shooters are usually white men so that's ok.
What about the angel moms whom have also had their children MURDERED by gun violence? Where‚Äôs your voice for them?? Is it about money? The money you all receive from gun manufacturers? The crisis is within our borders, and although there may be a crisi at the southern border, children, AMERICAN children are being murdered inside their classrooms!!
What about the hundreds of families who had a member killed in the multiple shootings here in the USA
What about the victims parents in school shootings what are you doing for them
What about when Obama went on a apologizing campaign in the other countries? Look America doesn‚Äôt need anyone to apologize for the United States.
What an ass.
What are you doing for the families of mass shooting? There is more of need for that than immigration.
What are you going to do about the illegals using their ITEN numbers and filing tax returns, using their children back in Mexico as deductions!!!! It's costing billions of dollars of Americans tax money for their illegal refunds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What are you waiting for? Who's running this country? You have the power to protect this country, without the approval of the Democrats. DECLARE AN EMERGENCY! GET THE JOB DONE!
What can we do to help "our" citizens who are without right now, because "our" government sure isn't gonna do anything... Inslaving people... People "protesting"/"begging" to work because we live in a system of "work" and "money". vs self reliance, know how and bartering... Please write... Do not let your voice go unheard!!! If we don't fight for us... No one will??? The time is now... I guess inslaving people, while watching them lose everything, go hungry and possibly die without medical for appropriate medical care... Is how "he" was going to make America great again. Is it not enough that our school system suffer and we are one of the most illiterate countries on the planet, but now you want to cut funding. The rich will remain rich and poor will remain poor, no matter how great your credit is the 1% is running it's own people (per usual) into the ground.... Literally!!! #Speak #Amendments #OneLove #Freedom #SilenceKills #OneForAll

What does that have to do with hurting 800,000 of your own employees. Stop this insanity. What a moron.
What does that have to do with the illegals who commit murder in our country? Do you actually see a similarity between the 2? WOW
What else u got to lose? I'm sure the wife is very upset. Son gotta be humiliated. Extra protection bc some1 just might be trying by now. God forbid Ppl are protesting the white HOUSE. Ppl are protesting everywhere. The earth is even rebelling now.

What is really driving these immigrants to the US?  MARIJUANA!  Nancy Pelosi owns a vineyard, and you can bet she uses people who are here illegally.  Those illegal people are impacting California and the United States in a very serious way:  OUR HOUSING!!!  We in California are not reaping the benefits of the billions of dollars California and other states are reaping from marijuana sales, but the CA government is reaping the benefits, while we pay outrageous rents, leaving little disposable income to spend.  Californians get poorer, but Nancy and other farm and vineyard owners get richer.  NANCY PELOSI OWNS A VINEYARD.  Read this vice article, and you will understand more.  Pelosi and her ilk do not want to register these workers.  They do not pay taxes.  https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/evq7gn/californias-legal-weed-farms-are-replacing-trimmigrants-with-immigrants
What is wrong with you people that are laughing about this?What if it was your child being raped and murdered?Do you hate Trump that much or are you just sick evil people?
What is your problem... youre staying  rightnow in the City of London? You look at my timeline and read and study the publications about the Almighty God ...there you will find alot of goodness .The Almighty God will touch you and pour out His healing balm over your live!
What kind of chicken hides behind walls when this is the greatest country in the world.  Walls for chickens!
What kind of evil cold blooded politicians can not feel the pain of so many moms and dads who have had children murdered by illegal immigrants. The kind of politician that I would not want representing me. Pelosi and Schummer could care less about anyone other than themselves they are both to vile to serve American citizens. People from California and New York should be very proud of Nancy and Chuck no one else is.
What part of "trump and his supporters" did you not understand? Was it the "trump" part, or the "his supporters" part?   Obviously you did not open the link and read the article, due to your rapid reply.  Please learn to read!
What pledge did you make to all the family members killed by white American males in mass shootings?
What we didn‚Äôt hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the Trump Shutdown.
What we'd really like to hear is what other parts of the very broken immigration system are you looking at? The legalization process for non-resident aliens can take months or years in some cases. And the work visa situation is a huge problem as well. It's not only about border security.
What would Hillary Clinton do today about the caravan invasions if she was president?  Nothing.
What's up with the 3 year extension on DACA & TSA? Not happy about that. Not sure compromising on something that is wrong in order to get something that is right is the way to go. Stop pandering to the Dems and stick to what is right Donald J. Trump and we real Americans will stick with you!
What's wrong with wanting to protect American citizens? Why are Dems so interested in helping illegals and not our own homeless and veterans? The illegals are getting paid to be here given benefits we cant obtain free education
What, you're status as an angel depends on the race of your murderer?
What?

When all fails lie,lie,lie ....Democrats memo .
When are you people going to wake up.. Like really.. The only thing TRUMP has going for him ,well had ..was his uncle..
When is Obama going to be held accountable for interfering with President Trump's administration? You know Pelosi met with him in Hawaii right? I have heard tale that the rest of the Democratic party in Puerto Rico met with the Soros group there. In my opinion this "little trip" she planned was her way of being gone while Obama and Soros things tried something.
When it is made an ultimatum to get votes for Pelosi, that‚Äôs a bit different.
When something so rudimentary seemingly can‚Äôt be fixed we must acknowledge that it is no longer about the survival of a constitutional America, but the survival of the swamp dwellers and the club they have in Washington. #buildthewall
When the nuclear war come to USA for lack of democrats
When the wall will be finish we'll make atourist destination for liberal dems to see the beauty
When will you protect our children at school? At the synagogues? At church? At bars? At work? At music festivals? At movie theatres? All slaughtered innocents by American white men w/easy access  to military weapons
When you can't act like an adult, you make your own news network? Seriously?
When you finally declare an emergency!   Build the wall. We need to bury barbed wire fence and other damaging materials all under the ground near the wall to also keep the illegals from tunneling
When you have a bunch of white kids screaming "build the wall!" at indigenous people it's apparent the wall has nothing to do with border security, it's simply a monument to white supremacy. This is America's Shame.
When you hold a job make sure you open up a savings account this way you have money for a time like this stop wasting money on junk and open a savings account we need the wall my daughter was killed by an illegal immigrant he had 9 different names thats what they do they lie

Where Does Illegal Immigration Mostly Occur? Here's What The Data Tells Us By Sean McMinn & Renee KlahrÔøΩJanuary 10, 20194:58 PM ET  When it comes to people in the country without proper documentation, the majority of them didn't cross the Mexican border at all. Most of them came to the United States legally ‚Äî but then don't leave. About 700,000 travelers to the United States overstayed their visas in fiscal 2017, the most recent year for which the Department of Homeland Security has published figures. DHS estimated that, as of Sept. 30, 2017, the end of that fiscal year, more than 600,000 of those travelers were still in the U.S.

Who‚Äôs going to pay for the Wall, MEXICO come on yell it Trump Supporters
Why
Why Democrats reject your request because it was not right. No Berlin today.
Why Liberals just don‚Äôt understand these Trump Supporters   A question asked by a Trump supporter: "Why do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid?‚Äù  Here's what we really think about Trump supporters - the rich, the poor, the malignant and the innocently well-meaning, the ones who think and the ones who don‚Äôt...  That when you saw a man who had owned a fraudulent University, intent on scamming poor people, you thought ‚ÄúFine."  That when you saw a man who had made it his business practice to stiff his creditors, you said, ‚ÄúOkay."  That when you heard him proudly brag about his own history of sexual abuse, you said, "No problem.‚Äù  That when he made up stories about seeing Muslim-Americans in the thousands cheering the destruction of the World Trade Center, you said, "Not an issue.‚Äù  That when you saw him brag that he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue and you wouldn't care, you chirped, "knows me.‚Äù  That when you heard him illustrate his own character by telling that cute story about the elderly guest bleeding on the floor at his country club, the story about how he turned his back and how it was all an imposition on him, you said, "That's cool!‚Äù  That when you saw him mock the disabled, you thought it was the funniest thing you ever saw.  That when you heard him brag that he doesn't read books, you said, "Well, who has time?‚Äù  That when the Central Park Five were compensated as innocent men convicted of a crime they didn't commit, and he angrily said that they should still be in prison, you said, "That makes sense.‚Äù  That when you heard him tell his supporters to beat up protesters and that he would hire attorneys, you thought, ‚ÄúYes!"  That when you heard him tell one rally to confiscate a man's coat before throwing him out into the freezing cold, you said, "What a great guy!‚Äù  That you have watched the parade of Neo-Nazis and white supremacists with whom he curries favor, while refusing to condemn outright Nazis, and you have said, "Thumbs up!‚Äù  That you hear him unable to talk to foreign dignitaries without insulting their countries and demanding that they praise his electoral win, you said, "That's the way I want my President to be.‚Äù  That you have watched him remove expertise from all layers of government in favor of people who make money off of eliminating protections in the industries they're supposed to be regulating and you have said, "What a genius!‚Äù  That you have heard him continue to profit from his businesses, in part by leveraging his position as President, to the point of overcharging the Secret Service for space in the properties he owns, and you have said, "That's smart!‚Äù  That you have heard him say that it was difficult to help Puerto Rico because it was the middle of water and you have said, "That makes sense.‚Äù  That you have seen him start fights with every country from Canada to New Zealand while praising Russia and quote, "falling in love" with the dictator of North Korea, and you have said, "That's statesmanship!‚Äù  That Trump separated children from their families and put them in cages, managed to lose track of 1500 kids, has opened a tent city concentration camp in the desert in Texas - he explains that they're just "animals" - and you say, "Well, OK then.‚Äù  That you have witnessed all the thousand and one other manifestations of corruption and low moral character and outright animalistic rudeness and contempt for you, the working American voter, and you still show up grinning and wearing your MAGA hats and threatening to beat up anybody who says otherwise.  What you don't get, Trump supporters in 2019, is that succumbing to frustration and thinking of you as stupid may be wrong and unhelpful, but it's also...hear me...charitable. Because if you're NOT stupid, we must turn to other explanations, and most of them are less flattering.  (Author unknown)
Why a wall?If a bigger problem seems 2 be underground?
Why are federal workers protest signs saying to pay them, that bills are piling up?  When the sign should say, if your not going to pay us a federal worker, then the same rules apply to you, you work for the government, a rules a rule and applies to all!  I guarantee if there pockets affected there wouldn't be no squabbling between both parties, they'd come to  decisions quick.
Why are we giving this Pelosi so much power?
Why are we letting Pelosi rule this country? She is not President and yet she is saying no to things the Democrats would like to compromise on and get this country moving again. She needs to resign due to selfish, over bearing, mental problems that we can all see in her. She is overstaying her mental ability to be worth a nickel. I am ashamed of her and I am not a Democrat.
Why are we letting one crazy idiot woman hold all of America hostage. Keep calling her out somehow she has to go
Why are you making harder for people who aren't white to come to our country? If you streamlined the system then a lot of the people could be legal. People who want to be here to make a living and make our country better, like the immigrants before them. Making it harder causes more people to feel like the only way out of their horrible situation is to sneak into our country. We are not a big friendly neighbor anymore. We are the big bully who lives next door who has poisoned the water and killed the parents! Our history in Central and South the United States of America has caused a lot of these people's pain and suffering. Before any of you reply with your snowflake, right wing, whining agenda, try studying about what has happened since Reagan was in office. And try using actual facts. Not Fox, Breietbart or other federalist nonsense!
Why are you still giving assistance to illegals? If you stopped they would not be here, if you fined those who hire them they would not be here.
Why can they not just get on with building the wall surely mr trump is the president with the power and obviously the love for the American people and safety is paramount Wish we had him in uk
Why can't people be themselves?
Why can‚Äôt the compromise be hiring more border patrol or stationing troops instead of building a wall?  I would support that.
Why can‚Äôt trump just fire Nancy problem solved
Why can‚Äôt we use Thoughts and Prayers to protect the border?  It‚Äôs what we use to protect our schools.
Why did Pelosi want to leave the country during the shutdown? I am still waiting to hear why she thought that was ok.
Why did you not mention ONE WORD to the people you have shut out of work or have working without pay? Yet another missed opportunity. üò¢
Why do Democrats support and defend illegal immigration, even declaring "sanctuary cities and States", and also resist voter ID?  How does supporting illegal immigration and fraudulent voting benefit the average US citizen? Any citizen?  How could anyone vote for any Democrat and think themselves a patriot?
Why do you say that Ted?
Why does Nancy and Chuck hate you so much to deny America its security?  When they approve the taking care of Illegals in the amount of what?  $138 Billion PER YEAR.  When All they have to do is do what AMERICA wants, that is build the wall, or should I say FINISH the wall for a one time price of $5 billion.  So why do nancy and chuck HATE America so much?
Why does this website need my contact information, you have all the information you need through Facebook....just build the dam wall...enough is enough.
Why don't you crack down on the American employers that employ illegal immigrants. If there are less jobs in America for illegal immigrants than they won't want to come here .    a wall is a stupid idea.
Why don't you make a pledge to all families affected by gun violence?
Why don‚Äôt you just take the money you need for your ‚Äú230 miles‚Äù of wall from all of the corrupt congressmen, senators, lobbyist, pharmaceutical companies and monopolized businesses???? I bet you could fund your wall REALLY FAST if you did that!! And I bet you‚Äôd gain some brownie points along the way with the average Americans who are suffering from this unnecessary shut down. Just saying.... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It‚Äôs time to ‚Äúput your money where your mouth is‚Äù
Why don‚Äôt you think of something that will actually work, like technology.  You can go over and under a wall and you know it.  The people you claim to want to keep out don‚Äôt even come into this country that way.
Why is Lindsay Graham in Turkey? ü§î
Why is Mexico helping the migrants?  Why doesn‚Äôt  Mexico put up a wall at there most southern boarder?   This is an invasion !
Why is anyone blaming Trump? He is at work in the White House .... Our representatives should be required to work too or no pay... I can‚Äôt tell my boss I‚Äôm not gonna do what you want or negotiate with you on what‚Äôs expected and still get paid! It is a shame that workers are caught in this but blame who is at fault, Trump has made several suggestions to open and start negotiations... I don‚Äôt know one person that does not have a fence around their property ! Secure the borders, and let people enter legally....
Why is it ok for Melanoma to be in Florida?
Why is most people against the wall think about all the job security it will bring to the people in those states
Why is there even a laughing Emoji? There's nothing at all funny about the SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR NATION AND HER PEOPLE! Anyone using laughing emoji is either an IGNORANT LIBERAL OR AN ILLEGAL!üòí
Why negotiate with this idiot? He changes what he wants daily!!! Who ever said he was a great deal maker? Oh yeah, he did. That has been proven false!!! Last year he could have gotten 25 billion for his wall. All he had to do was give in on DACA. Now he wants 5.8 billion in exchange for DACA. If he is on the other side of negotiations you have to be happy. You‚Äôll be able to get anything from this BABY!!!
Why not hold negotiations with dems on camera so all Americans can see how they are
Why settle for one wall? Let's go for three, and a barred door, for the #FakePresident who is the enemy of the people and the #MoscowPuppet.
Why she look so old n plain jane ish...lol  Looks like a witch
Why stop at the southern border. Completely confine the USA  with a total wall. Make it an island.
Why woud they even want to meet with Pelosi?  It's obvious that she and the rest of the liberals don't give a crap about them or their dead kids.  They simply don't want Trump to get any credit for cleaning up this nation, no matter who it hurts.
Why would Democrats consider ANY deal with trump before the government is re-opened? trump has reneged on immigration/border security deals at least twice in the past (Jan 2017 and Dec 2018) when Jim Jordan, Tom Cotton, Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, or Sean Hannity have changed trump's mind for trump, after trump told Democrats what he wanted, bipartisan plans were delivered, and then he changed his mind! The man-boy trump needs to stop crying "wolf" or he will never have any credibility.  Ann Coulter is already whining, so, what, deal off again?
Why would she meet with them? Unlike trump Nancy doesn‚Äôt want to use these devastated families to make her point.  trump keeps banging on about promises kept, but he hasn‚Äôt.  All he has to do is to keep his promise.  He needs to, either admit he lied about that promise or go to Mexico and collect the funds for the wall. Your move trump
Will Hurd‚Äôs Texas district alone spans 42% of the entire US-Mexico border  Hurd is a former CIA agent  He is a Republican  He opposes the wall --https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/will-hurd-border-wall-myth-781204/

Will some one please remind the damn government as a whole who they work for? They don't work for the party. They work for us!!!   Now put up that damn wall and let's move on!
Will tell Nancy I am 100% behind whatever she does!  But I am 200% sure I don‚Äôt want a wall and all the money needing to be spent on it.  T rump will be out of office and that wall won‚Äôt be built!  Money right down the drain!  Does he love his American people enough to donate that money out of his own money???  He seems to be afraid and does want that wall for protection. Yes
Will the wall keep out the CIA as well? They seem to bring quite a few drugs through from South America?
Willard Swanke i want a wall built deep and tall.
William Bush  actually it doesn‚Äôt. It only applies to citizens.

William Bush what has he done that is so bad???!
William Bush what the hell are you babbling about? Are you sure you have the right post you idiot?
William Bush wtf
William Bush yes, exactly. Especially when the powers that be hated him so much. Why? Why would they suddenly hate someone whom they loved? That makes me suspicious. It makes me wonder what they are so afraid of? I've never seen a president more slandered than Trump.
William Bush üêÄ
William Bush, and it shouldn't!!! Sneak into this country and automatically get treated as a legal citizen is moronic, just like all libs!!! #BuildTheWall
William Peterson the American taxpayers !?
With all the amounts I‚Äôve seen of her spending tax dollars on alcohol, I would say she‚Äôs a full blown alcoholic and needs to go! She can‚Äôt even speak!

With or without the wall.  We have your back #Trump2020
With you Mr. President Donald J. Trump. Never trust them.
Wolf Solstice well even bernie n barack said its been broken for yrs...you'll believe them but laugh at trump when he says it? don't make much sense does it?
Won't do any good telling the Old sourpuss
Wonder if Vlad has the only copy of the tinkle tape?
Won‚Äôt the money going to the wall also go back to Americans when they buy material and labor and hiring staff to guard? Like isn‚Äôt that  a good thing to?
Worst fake trump news, impeachment  needed
Worth reminding folks that Trump could have had $25 billion for border security a year ago. But Trump, using an all-or-nothing approach, also demanded steep cuts in LEGAL immigration as well. So he wound up with nothing
Would be a DAMN shame if an Illegal alien killed Pelosi and Schumer. The irony would be fucking hilarious.
Would that all felt your way
Would you rather fund planned parenthood or angel families that's a question to put to the public.
Wow When doors of homes are unlocked and off the house, when banks take off their doors, and doors at jails are not needed,and the pope takes his wall away  then the wall not needed, reasons for BUILD THAT WALL!
Wow leave the borders open import some Muslims and just like that we get socialists in office ... plenty other countries to go to if you prefer socialism ....have a safe trip
Wow you created these problems at the border and now you don't know how to fix it. So typical from someone who so stupid and should never have been president.
Wow!  That says a lot when the speaker of the house refuses to talk to people affected by the loss of a loved one.   Power has corrupted her for sure.
Wow! Thank you for sharing! Love and pray for our President Trump and family and also now praying for you angel Moms! Blessings strength and wisdom for all!!!!üòòüôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è
Wow, Nancy and her holier than thou self is so concerned about the employees not getting paid, she just told news reporters in reference to Trumps offer that she in so many words is off work today and won't discuss on her personal precious time.You go ole Nancy!!!

YES.
YOU ALSO PROMISED OR MADE A PLEDGE THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR THE DAMN WALL "NOT" THAT YOU WOULD HOLD 800,000 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES HOSTAGE IN ORDER TO GET YOUR DIAPERS CHANGED!
YOU CANT DEAL W/THE DEMOCRATS,THE ONLY THING THEY UNDERSTAND,IS VIOLENCE,\
YOU DID NOT MAKE ANY SUCH PLEDGE AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ELECTED HAD YOU PRESENTED YOURSELF THAT WAY.    YOU!!!  "Promised" to end DACA.  Build the Wall.  End chain migration.  Offer legislation to change immigration law.  You were going to DEMAND the additional manpower necessary to accomplish the deportation of every person who entered this country illegally.   YOU  lied.  You surrendered on DACA almost immediately. You submitted your FINAL surrender to the American people last year when having given you and your Party what you demanded, the presidency and both Houses of Congress, you REFUSED to Veto and signed that horrible Omnibus bill.    So much more.  Like full funding Planned Parenthood and the like.  Everything that matters long term for the sake of our progeny, like who lives and dies and who comes into this country and stays, YOU intentionally failed us on.    Have a nice day, orange guy.  When they come for you for impeachment, i'm going to change the channel.
YOU GO MR. TRUMP!!!
YOU HAVE ALL DACA & TPS RECIPIENTS & HALF AMERICAN-HISPANIC POPULATION BEHIND YOU AFTER THIS PROPOSAL. PELOSI IS HANDICAPPED BY A DEEPLY, & WE MEAN DEEPLY DIVIDED CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS. A 3RD OF THEIR VOTERS ARE BEHIND OCASIO-CORTEZ. DEM CONGRESS MAJORITY MIGHT BE A GIFT TO REPUBLICANS, THEY‚ÄôLL PROTEST YOUR PERSONALITY & WILL GET NOTHING DONE. & DEMS LOVE YOUR DACA/TSP IDEA BUT HALF DON‚ÄôT WANT YOU TO GET CREDIT FOR IT.
YOU HAVE ONLY MADE PROMISES TO PUTIN.
YOU TELL nancy she and her buddy schumer are out of a job BUT you will give them 3 squares and a cot and a nice orange jumpsuite for the next 30 years

Yadira Bornacelli God bless you too Babyüòòüòò
Yadira Bornacelli Hillary hasn't went nowhere yet, so I doubt if she goes anywhere at all but to the luxury and comfort of her own home lol. Wishful thinking won't help u
Yadira Bornacelli I don't know about the others, but neither Pelosi nor Obama have walls around their properties.
Yadira Bornacelli so much jealousy of Obama by Trumpers. George Will, a life long conservative has NAILED it! https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-a-misery-it-must-be-to-be-donald-trump/2019/01/18/d0e05eea-1a82-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html?fbclid=IwAR2ZjCSryjDhcqtJ3n5lnwgwzQMy9qUj21LNzN1iEln5LaUj1Ap_W86h8Ic&utm_term=.5a90143900d
Yadira Bornacelli yes to promote good will...my eye....she is pathectic...
Yadira Bornacelli you don't even educate American children :') You're the stupidest nation on the planet
Yadira Bornacelli, aren't you being exclusively discrimnatory?  What is an American? And so if I don't agree with Trump I'm not an American or I'm actually a communist? So we all must think like you and believe what you believe, or else?
Yadira Bornacelli, so if I think differently than you, I'm a Liberal, or if I'm not a follower of Trump, I'm liberal. Is it either your way or nothing at all? Until the mid election didn't the Republicans have control. Your semantics lack genuine truth and reasoning.
Yadira a little prayer for you! May your breath continue to stink like human excrement from all the bullshit you spew!
Yadira bullshit! I‚Äôve never seen a bigger bigot than Yadira against her fellow Latinos! People stand up to this moron!
Yadira copy and paste!
Yadira may your evening be filled with dirty ass holes, ready for your sniffing!
Yadira smelling like fish again?
Yadira sniff sniff!?
Yadira still sniffing your own butt you tramp?
Yadira why so many lies wann be white Latina?
Yadira yet another blatant lie? You really are a baffoon!

Yall would rather ruin the economy then to re open the government ridiculous
Yanira Blanco  Yadira, stop the BS...Lyin Donnie PROMISED to get the Justice Department to investigate Hilary and ‚ÄúLock her up‚Äù...another Trump LIE
Yanira Blanco what have any of the four people you mentioned done to deserve prison time? The last time I checked a bunch of Trumps people were going to prison including his personal lawyer, campaign manager and national security advisor. Trump is under 17 investigations. But yes, lets put the elderly billionaire George Soros in jail- who by the way is a super generous billionaire that actually gives his money to charity unlike Trump who ran a fraudulent foundation.  What is your obsession with Soros anyway? I think you might be watching too much right wing propaganda.
Yap B.U.I.L.D.THE WALL
Yawn...Democrats have called for the impeachment of GOP presidents in ‚Äò81, ‚Äô83, ‚Äô84, ‚Äô91, ‚Äô04, ‚Äò05, and ‚Äò07.ü§°

Yea. Your pledge was Mexico was going to pay for it.  Now you‚Äôre holding 800k peoples pay check hostage until America pays for it.  What an ass
Yeah but you don't give a damm about all the government people that YOU PUT OUT OF WORK, BECAUSE OF YOUR TANTRUM OVER THE WALL. PLEASE STEP DOWN MR FAKE PRESIDENT
Yeah ok but money given to illegals isn't theirs is it ? What's your response now? Let them in feed , house, educate , and free medical plus housing benefits on our tax dollar !!! Disprove me on this !!
Yeah ok, all Americans love him üôÑ Sure.
Yeah you're really fixing it all right
Yeah! Doing great! I get to drop out of nursing school because of this! Way to better our futures.
Yeah, if we dont' get the wall with Trump, we never will
Yelena Tsarikovsky actually, when America sneezes, the world catches cold.
Yelena Tsarikovsky your surname sounds very Russian...and you're a Trump Supporter da?
Yep
Yep. That or she is compromised somehow. A lot of us in CA think the MX cartels have taken control of our dem politicians.
Yes
Yes ,I stand with YOU
Yes CNN ABC WAsh Post NY Times have polls of 788 people, 475 people, and other  silly polls...when there is 325 million that live in the USA. So Pelosi states "NO" prior to the speech. She and her group want the Gov't opened, then they will proceed to "talk". Let's see now: You loan me $500,000 now, and later we will "talk" & I will agree to sign the Contract, well maybe and maybe NOT. Hilarious ! Or is there a problem with what sits above the neck on the LEFT ? That is an assumption that others are as dumb as you are.
Yes I stand with President Trump always
Yes I want the Wall
Yes Sir & Friends !!! We All Service BY USA People & SAFE For Country !!! Never For Nancy !!!! She MUST BE Listen From USA People First !!!
Yes Texas needs the wall . Stop all the Drugs following  into  our country also all the crime . WE NEED A WALL NANCY .
Yes Wall....!!!!
Yes a wall....but better drug control. I‚Äôm ok with immigrants coming here legally, to work. (Not to bilk our system) The main reason should be drug control. Show these people a few episodes of Border Wars, they will get a clue as to how bad things really are.
Yes and we are with you
Yes because people in their 50s/60s remember a country without these problems. After Israel built their wall, terrorism decreased by 99%, so walls work, even the least intelligent among us know that
Yes he does Nancy is stalling fact!
Yes reported
Yes sure do.
Yes this is all about "Angel Families" first not government workers and that is across the board. Sometimes being an American takes sacrifice for what is right. The Angel families sacrificed first and will suffer for the rest of there lives not just a few weeks as their loved ones will never get a pay check because they are dead! The Angel Families will suffer directly due to our failed immigration policy for a lifetime, It's time to finish the wall.
Yes to the wall! I think it's shameful of what the house is doing to our country and our leader.
Yes voters need to contact their representatives
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
Yes you men spider rider for libert√©  solidarit√© and la ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ un word
Yes, remember when Pelosi said we have to pass the Obamacare bill to be able to see what's in it.
Yes, you also pledged to repeal Obummercare, Mandatory EVERIFY!!
Yes, you also promised #NoDACA and #NoAmnesty. Keep your promises.  #MAGA
Yes...You did it...sir ! and Congratulations TO U... Today is January /20 day of your Presidential inauguration like 45th president of USA  ...
Yesssssss, get this over with, start prosecuting, now, killary first & all else will fall with her üò°Start peeling the corrupt onion of all time , NOW !
Yesterday we saw a rosy cheeked Trump teen, educated at a private Christian school, stare down in racial disgust at one of the most respectable and honorable beings on this earth.   It was a disgusting display of Trump inspired behavior.
Yet NANCY put out a screw you letter to DACA and the workers BEFORE he even uttered a word.  Sadly this is 100% about TRUMP.. screw the country.
Yet another move that proves Donny is beyond desperate!  Don‚Äôt repeat Donny‚Äôs fear-mongering lies...edit his letter to Pelosi and add sane voices to his bombardment attempt!  Fact-checking Trump's border speech and DACA offer  https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/01/19/politics/fact-check-trump-speech/index.html
Yet you allow DACA. Totally pathetic.
You CHUMP supporters fail to realize if YOU are not Native American YOU ARE AN ILLEGAL..   PISS ON TRUMP and His Goons..
You NEVER hear a POSITIVE MESSAGE FROM THE LEFT
You Rock! Defy the left at every opportunity!!!!
You all can not do a damn thing about it but twiddle your thumbs as long as politician and Democrats need Shady votes they will keep getting away with it the reason President Donald Trump can't do a damn thing about it, it's because the house has control over what people can say and do and what they can vote for not the people and not the presidentthe legalization of recreational marijuana could be used could pay for the wall
You also made a pledge to all Americans that their #2A rights were safe.
You also made a pledge to represent all Americans. Now I know you can‚Äôt do that cuz we all have different opinions. But atleast represent the fuckin majority. And the majority think your personal monument, referred to as a wall, is stupid and a waste of funds.
You also made a promise that we would not have to pay for it!!!
You also made a promise to the America people ... remember MEXICO IS GONNA PAY FOR IT!!! So glad when this turd is impeached.  Most hated President ever!!!
You also said that San Antonio has a border wall.
You also took this oath:   I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.   Instead you üí© on it everyday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You and McConnell won‚Äôt allow a vote to help Americans but you will allow a vote to help Russia by lifting sanctions!!!! Time to impeach, these two need to go. Weakest 2 people in congress.
You are NOT serving all Americans!
You are WAISTING your time with Nancy because she just DOES NOT GIVE A DAM about AMERICANS. She is an AGO MANIAC and has no interest in we 2nd class people called AMERICANS.
You are a corrupt puppet of Russia.
You are a liar
You are a liar Trump!!!
You are a liar and a fascist. We don't want your wall for a fictional crisis, we don't even want you as president.
You are a liar, your promises are worth nothing! LOL
You are a terrorist
You are a traitor.  You belong in prison.
You are an Angel Mr. Trump !
You are an abomination. Just go away.
You are an idiot man-baby, stop the temper tantrum, reopen govt, PAY YOUR SAFETY PERSONNEL!   You are actively making the US less safe!   MAGA=RESIGN.
You are as loony as Pelosi!!!
You are being too nice and compromising.....the Dems don't care! WAKE UP TRUMP!
You are doing it all wrong....America is not Russia comrade.  When are you going to listen to Americans trump and not Putin...you puppet.  Impeachment is to good for you trump
You are fighting, you've shut down the government, you dolt.
You are hurting the working people of this country.  You are going to be FORCED to end your shutdown and you are NOT getting your useless wall. You will be offered $ for border security, though, so don't turn it down again.
You are ignoring those killed by home grown white supremacy who killed more Americans than any other group.  Only 1% of crime is committed by illegal Immigrants.  Manipulating the statistics is evil and wrong.
You are in my prayers, Mary Ann Mendoza.  Keep the faith.  I support you totally in this effort to build a wall.  May your angel son rest in peace.  God bless you for your immense sacrifice for our country. <3 You are right about this defining moment in the Democratic Party for Speaker Pelosi and many, many Democrats.
You are loyal AF!
You are manufacturing a false crisis so that you can fulfill a nincompoop campaign promise that you didn't even explore before you started shooting off your fat mouth. You're a fool. And your minions are a con man's dream...
You are my favourite republican ever Charlie :D
You are one in million and million in one. Love you Trump ‚ù§‚ù§
You are our best president ever! We are so blessed to have you! DONALD J. TRUMP 2020! YESSS!
You are sheeptarded.
You are so right.  She needs fired.  Such a hate filled person.
You are the Devil‚Äôs messenger.  You make life hell for everyone.
You are the best President of all time.
You are the devil
You are the greatest!
You are the swamp. Give it up, Fatty. The majority of America is against you and your cronies.
You are truly the best president trump üôåüèº. Thank you so much for fighting for the American people not giving into the Democratic Party to further destroy this beautiful country.
You are using a fake news show after the election? Propaganda pig puppet.
You backed down from secure Borders. you should of  declared an emergency ifs too late now.
You better publically condemn the disrespectful behavior of the punks   from Covington, Kentucky, in their MAGA camps who harrassed the Native American elder.  The gentleman is a Vietnam War veteran.   Anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about can Google it and find videos of the event.  Your own speech and behavior influences some people to behave very poorly.  You set a very weak example.
You bring out the absolute worst in people
You bumb ass inconsiderate incapable unaware of you who pissing off mc Donald‚Äôs sponsoring half dead muthafucka get on my last nerves If u want a wall so bad u go over there and build that mf yo damn self ol pissy pot bitch ass nigga!
You call what trump is doing as rebuilding? Lol he‚Äôs destroying our nation!
You can clearly see how the POTUS cares for the security of the United States. Just look at the extreme he goes to make certain the American people are safe. He has the big picture, we just have street view. Let him continue being president.
You can help me
You can not force a co equal branch of government to your will !   It's more bigly than national security and a fukin wall, it's Donald trying to have all the power in our democracy !  Open Your Government !  Feed Your Employees!   Hissy fit your wall later!
You can thank whatever you want but what don't you get? :) bit.ly/45wall3, bit.ly/45wall103, bit.ly/45shutdown, bit.ly/45Polish, bit.ly/45illegal, bit.ly/45NoStormy, bit.ly/45care, bit.ly/45fake, bit.ly/45Putin, bit.ly/45NoKo, bit.ly/45fake bit.ly/45taxBS2
You cannot have border security without a strong physical barrier.  Do you remember 9/11?  We've gotten too complacent.  Do we need another terror attack to get you people to understand that?
You cannot tell Pelosi anything.....she knows it all!!!!
You can‚Äôt fix stupid
You couldn't negotiate your way out of a paper bag
You cynically exploit the "Angel" families, despite the reality that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than citizens, and now cynically offer your "compromise". You created the DACA and TPS crises, and now try to exploit those whose suffering you caused with your hypocritical "compromise" to reopen the government. You closed the government and must reopen it now! You use and abuse the 800,000 government employees whose lives you are destroying! Each day your self-serving evil becomes more apparent to the American people!
You do it, you irrelevant foreign troll!o
You do know nobody climbs a fence carrying a ton of cocaine right?
You do not Negotiate with a president when he has the country hostage!!
You do realize that swamp thang is manipulating you. These heart breaking stories meant to assault ones sensibilities and inflame those already buying into racial division. The parents of the victims of school shooting also have heart breaking stories and their are more of them than there are victims of violence related to refugees/immigrants. This made up crisis is there simply to deflect from the multiple investigations into Swamp thang, his administration,his foundation and relationships with numerous foreign entities.  The deal he offered was not made in good faith. How can you hold hundreds of thousand people hostage and forced slavery in exchange for holding another vulnerable group hostage for future leverage?  There is nothing good or presidential about swamp thang. He represents the very worst of what humanity has to offer. Shame on you swamp thang,shame on your administration and shame on the party of trump. I have faith that the american people are a hell of a lot smarter than you give them credit for and see right through your manipulations. People and paychecks before Vanity walls.
You doing a great job
You don't need 3.2 billion. And what happened to you getting mexico to pay for the wall you joke! ?? üòÇüòÇ
You don‚Äôt have a clue
You don‚Äôt need to apologize to trump supporters; they‚Äôre idiots, they don‚Äôt know any difference.
You don‚Äôt represent America
You elected him because you‚Äôre idiots.
You fake conartist! You and will pay. The world is watching and you will be held accountable.
You go President Trump! Whatever it takes. Chuck and Nancy are not for the people! They are for themselves to get richer and maintain power. They are both from Sanctuary states. All about the votes. Want to Keep people poor and dependent on the government. Wake up folks! Trump 2020!
You go President Trump. All the way with you on this
You go nancy,only the trumptards believe in his fear mongering.
You go trump
You go trump !!
You guys can take the walk and shove it up your candy ass
You had Republican control for 2 years. Why didn't they give you the money for your wall????? This is all on you. Not the Democrats!!!! I was hoping the major announcement was you were resigning!
You have a huge platform on January 29th. Have all Angel moms at The State Of The Union Address , including Cpl. Singh‚Äôs family. This will totally embarrass the democrats and will point out the problem we have at our southern border.
You have done it from day one and that is why you are president. Thank you so much!
You have my full support. The disrespect of people infiltrating of southern border illegally needs to be punished. They laugh at the US‚Äôs weak laws and enforcement. The Democrats are complicit. Why? Because building up the obedient, completely dependent underclass is how they stay in power. Half the population keeps voting them in. The fix is in!
You have my permission to talk about me now DeBOREah (made it easy and blocked you, I know that will bug you silly)
You have never lived in a border state! Like the Dems- all talk- no facts.
You have proven my point with your responses.  That's the best you can do?
You have reached out with a compromise.  Give nothing more!  Build the wall!!!
You have the high ground Mr. President. I'm with you Sir.
You haven't done squat except deprive families of their paychex - WORST president EVER
You heard her Omar
You insulted an Angel family at your convention. You‚Äôre a lying pig.
You know I don't care about the freaking wall anymore or any of their proposals or plans! I care about the American people. Isn't  the lower and middle class taking  the hit for this they are the ones suffering from this dag burn government shutdown. I wash my hands of the republicans and democrats.   What's going to become of those surviving off of food stamps?  What's going to become of the multitude that have basically lost their job due to this shutdown? They may be working but they aren't reaping no benefits. I mean if it goes on that's a lot of loss and destruction for so many many families, single men and women, children, etc.. oh well I babbled but my heart is heavily burdened and restless over this.
You know I just dont understand. President Trump was voted into the office of President by the people of the United States, that should be the end of it. He was voted in and is trying to do what is best for those (us) people. So let him, if you didn't like what he stood for you shouldn't of voted for him. Last time I checked to win the Presidency you have to have the most votes. So I would think the majority of people who voted think he knows what he doing, right? Then let him do it.
You know and I  know that as soon as government workers go back to work they will get BACK PAY for all the money that is due.....Why not get the Treasury Dept to give all of the employees short term loans at no interest until the shut down is fixed....Why NOT????
You know if this comes down to a civil war. It's gonna be common sense against all those who wilfully believe the media! Drain the swamp Mr President, or we are gonna have to!!
You know these aren't the only ones that lost their children, think about all the drugs that have also killed so many of the young people and older ones too
You know what he really needs to worry about who's going to bomb us next like 9/11 and everything else I think our borders are safe and secure we haven't had no issues with New Mexico at all he really needs to focus on people with ISIS people in other countries that might be planning on trying to bomb us or to do something why should New Mexico have to pay for a wall or want some type of freedom when they have never done nothing to us in the past 32 years that I have been alive New Mexico has never attacked us New Mexico has never done anything wrong you need to really worry about Germany Korea and the countries that will actually try to do some type of nuclear bomb on us this is the reason why I never vote
You know what i hate? Every time there is a poll or letter from anyone in government it ends with a donation.  Why is that?  Also the GOP always want money in Trumps name and many of them don‚Äôt or haven‚Äôt in the past been a supporter.  Just looking at our own problems.  I am sure liberals do the same, but we need to be better.
You know what they say about those ranting about joint  accounts right? Joaqu√≠n de la Maria you simply have nothing of value to add. Really? Who are you to attack a joint account? Logic would say a couple has ZERO trust issues if they are comfortable enough to leave social media info accessible to a significant other? No thots in the dm üòÇ  Seeing who you placed you're money on the wifey you're a likely dealing with your own serious insecurities or perhaps guilt?  Nice profile. Bless your thot heart. üòÇ#jelly
You know you're winning when Nancy and Schumer's page went totally silent weeks ago....baaahahaha. utter and totally unacceptable to have such anti American communists in office!!!!! Many lives were lost fighting against such evil as Nancy and Schumer!
You know, she WON'T see this. She is WAY too far gone!!
You liberals don‚Äôt listen to anyone who levels with you. All the border patrol including authorities from Obama Bin Laden‚Äôs administration are on Tucker, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham EVERY NIGHT telling you a wall is what they need; that in fact they can do their job if they had a wall. Further that you ignore the facts and listen to your socialists congress tells me you don‚Äôt want border security under ANY circumstances.  It suits you just fine that taxpayers are spending over a $billion dollars a year on these assholes.
You lie every day. Nobody trusts you. Open the government, then resign for the good of our country.
You lost my vote in 2020 with the antics over the wall. I'm not impressed.
You made a deal for daca. Wrong move!! Very wrong of you!!!
You made a pledge Mexico will pay for the wall too!
You made a pledge to the American people to protact and serve , not just Angel families.. this shutdown violates that pledge... workers are going without pay because of your lies about the dam wall... are their livelihoods being destroyed really worth a wall... I think not...
You made a pledge to use their tragic circumstances for your political gain. Pure evil.
You made a pledge to yourself.
You made a promise to provide your taxes and what about that affordable healthcare for everyone - you probably never kept a promise your entire life
You made a promise to your base..not all Americans
You made a promise to your sheep followers that you were going to build this big beautiful wall because you were the only one who knew about beautiful walls and MEXICO was going to pay for it.  Just goes to show your sheep that your a dumbass lying bastard.  And, they believed it.
You made fun of the slaughter that took place at Wounded Knee of Native American Indians you POS. Do me a favor and say something about Italians. I beg of you.
You made the pledge at Mexico's expense. Now you're asking the people of this poverty-stricken nation to foot the bill. Your continued deception is nauseating...
You mean like EVERY other president?
You mocked an angel family
You moron!
You naver did any good in your sad life pig
You need a mental checkup.  Losing a child is bad hand Americans are killing more often than immigrants.  This is false equivalency. You are always lying . Your Pinocchio nose is longer than your red ties.
You need to fix the Irs problem as well! Immigrants getting thousands of dollars in returns for claiming children not even in the us is ridiculous!
You need to stop trying to fund so much money to have that wall built. I know it's important but not so important that we the people have to suffer for it. People are working without pay and can't pay their bills and as a result are losing their homes all because you are arguing over a stupid wall. People's lives are more important than a wall. And not being with your family on Christmas because of that isn't right either. Why can't we just all get along? Find a way for the US and Mexico to live together in peace. God created the land for all mankind to live together, not so we could fight over it. I know the opinions of one person don't matter much but I just thought I'd get out how I feel about this. Please stop fighting and think about what's best for the people for once and do what's right.
You need. The wall. Why. Don't.   The. Democrats. She. Your. Try. To. Keep. American. Safe.  And. Drug. Free. Call emergency. Shut. Down. The. Boarder. Your. Doing. A great  job
You not need to change the wall for DACA stop that.  The   wall is for save the PEOPLE  from  USA  thanks Mr. President trump.
You notice the people most vocal against the wall are people that are nowhere near the southern border?!
You obviously don't have a mind of your own.
You obviously have no clue about how the government/politics works.
You offered nothing new, you simply suggested what you have suggested before, and that keeping Dreamers here for 3 year extension would give them time.  These are people who have jobs, education and lives to live, how does this help them plan for a future.  Angel Families... give me a break. You are a horrible negotiator, and your wall has only 29% approval by the American people. Trump Tower has its own news studio, now that is just wrong, news like that is dictator news. Spin it Trump, but the facts are still the facts.
You only make pledges to your base , you couldn't give two shits about anybody else. Actually you don't even care about your base because everybody knows it's all about you. You're like a grown mentally disturbed child playing adult games. You've never ran a successful business in your life and you expect to be able to run this country. the only running you will be doing is running this country into the ground. Those midterms were just the beginning. Even if the Mueller report didn't exist you're still not worthy to serve. When they throw you out of office and I hope they do it soon, they need to remove your name, your picture and your stench from the Halls of the White House and Capitol Hill.
You only want a huge monument to your ego.  It's amazing how many Trump supporters are suddenly socialists, demanding I pay for their wall.
You owe me money
You people have to know how money works in Politics by now? You can't be this stupid?
You pledged that Mexico would pay for the wall, you pledged better healthcare for all on Day 1, you promised long term tax reform for the middle class.... That's three big strikes,  I can keep counting. Shall I start with all the witches that have plead guilty or been convicted?
You pos have blood on your hands now.  American blood not ISIS blood.  The man who does not telegraph his military moves.  Pos  Liar  you will never see your fuvking wall no matter what it's made of.  You will see wall from inside a cell.    Hi magas.  I had hoped for a wonderful  vacation at mar a lago.   Thznk you America. thankful for all the all forest rakers, my cereal purchasing ID, Saudi leaders and my buddy Vlad, our troops protecting the border against a mythical caravan that might someday arrive with families- women and children fleeing violence and persecution, good guys with guns, good people on both sides, covfefe, disgraced talking-head Sean Hannity, InfoWars for giving us the truth about the Illuminati who truly rule the shadow government, my rotating Cabinet of pals, beautiful chocolate cake, my cool red hat, my weekly golf outing, but most of all, I‚Äôm thankful for money and power.   -And now to waste more tax dollars on a wall in no where land but i now own the shutdown.  Screw the federal workers.  They are not part of the one percent.  But I, Donald J. Trump am a great deal maker until today.    Maybe I should resign tomorrow   Yes Donald you should
You promised MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR THE WALL. NOT AMERICANS.
You promised a 1900  plus mile Wall!!!! Looks like you caved for a 300 mile fence and putting the dreamers on this side of it!    I hope a true conservative runs against you in 2020, all you have done is compromise and attacked our 2nd amendment and due process rights!üò¢
You promised to drain the swamp. Sadly,  the swamp is deep and wide. Not just democrat. It was built by those who put money over everything else. MSM pushes  it every waking hour and no one can stop it! No one! Me Me Me. Networks dangling fame and fortune in front of poorly raised children that have no moral center.  Our government thrives on ou discourse,  black against white American/ Mexican, gay/ straight.  As long as we're fighting each other they win.
You promised to pay all your workers and contractors, ask them how that went. Your promises mean NOTHING >>>
You ran on Mexico paying for the wall so quit asking us for money. Or are you not a man of your word.
You realize Angels are "gods" army and dying doesn't make you one right? They didn't have moms, they were created by "god" to keep humans under his control. Satan is an Angel, dead conservatives aren't...
You really need to learn sentence structure, it will give you some semblance of credibility.
You said Mexico will pay for it. Now you shut down the government you lied.
You self-centered ignorant sorry excuse for a human being federal employees in soup lines are you serious may God take your sorry ass out amen
You should be scared you fruit loop
You should have never cancelled pelosis flight......you should have cancelled her return flight!!!!!!!
You should make a pledge to do something about the mass slaughtering of innocent citizens and children in America. You, Donald J. Trump, did nothing.
You should of done it when you controlled the house and senate don‚Äôt blame dems for your republican caused
You shouldn't use words you don't know the meaning of. It makes you look stupid Charlie.
You spelled pelosi wrong
You spelled racists family wrong! üòé
You steal from your charities.  NY prosecutors have your #. No pardons in NY, üòÇüíôüá±üá∑üíôüá±üá∑üíôüá±üá∑üíôüá±üá∑
You stupid dumb moron
You sure must wear rose coloured glasses .  The entire world sees tRump for what he really is a sick phsyco  who should be impeached and imprisoned!
You think hailing her is making fun of her? :o Are you Brain Damaged?
You think the microbial life is a complex organism creature in the mass streams? Can it be caught in its shape shifting? UFOs real?
You took an oath to put this country first - you‚Äôve ignored the oath.
You took an oath to the American people- to defend our country against all threats both foreign and domestic- right now you Donald J trump are the biggest threat to our country- resign
You wont stop fighting?   With dodging Vietnam 5 times, you never STARTED fighting for this country in the first place you fucking coward!
You're Murikkkan, not American. There's a difference these days. I'm sure you can work it out if enough of you share your braincells. You may need a group in double figures though. Can enough of you get along for that to happen? I know Republicans aren't good at sharing or acting like decent people.
You're a fucking clown.
You're an adult with an imaginary friend. No wonder you're easily manipulated by smarter people than yourself
You're an idiot
You're gonna love President Trump even more once you do your taxes for 2018. Trust me. He is the right person for the people.‚ù§ Thank you, Mr. President.
You're likely going to need to call a State of Emergency to get the wall funding, Mr. Trump. These Democrats are nothing but obstructionists and subversives, who care not one iota about America or the American People. They care about getting back in power, period, and they see a huge influx of illegals in here as undocumented future Democrat voters. They scream about Voter IDs, borders, they want sanctuary cities around the country - their agenda is obvious. #BuildTheWall
You're not even from here dumbass....
You're stupid and donkey.
Your "pledge". You who was so low as to lie straight into the faces of our troops? You who have lied about things great and small? You have no honor and your "pledge" is worthless.
Your 1st two years you had Republican control in both houses.
Your Doing a Fantastic job. President Trump !!!
Your Mumma should've called you Richard, William Bush
Your REAL shutdown is becoming more harmful than the imaginary border crisis.
Your a fuckin clown you disgusting person
Your a real pretty boy aren't you?
Your an idiot. You must be getting free government handouts
Your approval rating is at 39%. Open our government
Your arguements are all weak as water.
Your boss isn't happy with you.......Ann Coulter ‚Äè Verified account  @AnnCoulter  1h1 hour ago More Trump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb!
Your boy signed it but it hasn't been ratified champ.  Mexico is not going to pay for Spankys vanity wall.
Your delusional lol it will to wanna bet money on it ?
Your fascist propaganda fools no one. It‚Äôs time to remove you from office.
Your idiot president will not make 2020. People would rather vote for a dog than him....maybe you should do some research and you can see for yourself he is the  MOST HATED  PRESIDENT EVER! But I know that's not gonna happen because people like you only believe what they want and not FACTS.
Your little girl is cute..what a shame she will be tought to admire men like your CORRUPT, narcissistic,pig.
Your not fixing anything your just making a jackass of yourself and of America
Your out alright out of your mind
Your parents were immigrants, your wife also, sneak
Your pledge to serve Putin seems to "Trump" any other.
Your promises, Mr. President,  do not make things better for Americans....only worse.  We have people lining up at food banks so their families get a decent meal, people have no money for gas for their cars, you have no idea how wrong you have been against our citizens....the pain and suffering they are experiencing is YOUR FAULT and not the Democrats. Own up to it and stop your vindictive behavior to all of us.  Your poor little rich guy attitude is disgusting and will be your downfall eventually, at the voting booth.
Your responsibility is to Federal Workers right now.  They take more priority at the moment.
Your the Greatest President I‚Äôve been exposed to in my lifetime. Keep up the good work, your doing a Phenomenal Job. God Bless America & Our Great President üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Your trying, they just hate you more than they care about us
Your. Are not doing anything for border security .   A wall is not border security
You‚Äôre a bit out of touch with majority apparently. Hell, majority of democrats didn‚Äôt even want Nancy as Speaker! She had to agree to term limit as speaker for them to vote for her.
You‚Äôre a fucking idiot. Or a paid trump poster.
You‚Äôre a fucking mad man.
You‚Äôre a lying fraud and a coward.  You don‚Äôt care about America. If you did you wouldn‚Äôt have done the Russian Treason.  Hiding behind families.  Propaganda from Putin‚Äôs little puppet!
You‚Äôre all so blind. Fuckin Idiots
You‚Äôre an idiot
You‚Äôre going to be impeached
You‚Äôre not doing anything noble... it‚Äôs time for you to GO!!!!
You‚Äôre shameless
Zach Smith I wonder why that is? Hum
Zionist/Commie swamp
^^PRETENDS he is a real man trashing women cause he's desperate for attention. TYPICAL LEFTY
a he carried ky  and now he want to starve people in the stick to death for a wall
a wall doesn't mean KEEP OUT  it simply means ' please use the door....'
a wall will not fix illegals and drugs coming in from Mexico...  Florida is surrounded by ocean and people still get desperate enough and find a way into Florida
add four more families :(. this happened last week and the illegal alien will be  charged with the murders   https://www.kolotv.com/content/news/Murder-charges-expected-against-suspect-in-Northern-NV-murders-504626241.html?fbclid=IwAR377RlhWAFeYhjYnnhebfKRxG3QV5g9jvgur5f9BH3lD9JdEop4WNXFUeQ
all Nancy wants is power and money
all male subanimal pornbasterds, too
all twitter members, too. they suspected me wihout 1 written tweet or one acting!
also the new Driver License rules are kind of "Draconian" the levels of proof of residence that you have to go through or else you can't take a commercial flight or set foot on federal land.. As a US Citizen who is a direct descendant of the original founders, I can tell you that I am having to face a massive headache for the first time JUST to have a compliant ID card on my drivers license.  This is draconian and it is caused by the fact that we probably have a large double digit percentage of non-citizens roaming around within our borders.  THIS IS A SEVERE PROBLEM!
amen
amen If Pelosi refuses to build wall,Impeach her and get the military to do it. I understand that another caravan is coming and 2 more behind this one is planned. Soon we will have to open a concentration camp for any who invade us...we must! Or collapse as a country
and in case FB is censoring it (its only showing a link which you may not "click on"--> it says 800,000 federal workers are not getting paid but 20 million non-citizens are so build the wall is essentially what the meme says.
and of course the leader of the german rebellion sigmar gabriel
and the zirkel family
and yet you have done nothing about it...
and you have never done anything bad in yours
angels are the best!! Go Trump What the hell is wrong with Demacraps I don't understand!
awesome...  then please go after this... https://www.newsweek.com/russia-routed-millions-influence-clinton-uranium-deal-informant-tells-congress-801686
because they know what you don't, now please i ordered a shave ice, im running late
both of you are stupid cunts
btw : MAGA.  President Trump puts together an honest effort to cooperate and end the shut-down amid an environment of absolutely tragic immaturity and lies.. the scary thing is : time is still ticking and running out.  There aren't too many more "Trumps" out there.  THANK GOD TRUMP HAS GREAT KIDS! ( and I am looking 20 to 30 years into the future here)
btw. the House controls the Federal Budget. If you had the first clue about how your own government functions, you would know that.

considering the fact that where it is already, it's effective 90%-95% kind of debunks your comment.
contacted the above and sent letter to my Congress person!  Thank you, Mr. President, for watching out for US, the American citizens!

illegal immigration equals democrat votes...Thats the only reason Nancy wants open borders...She does not care anything about their well being...Mt President Donald J. Trump. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
imma telling nancy i want to see your tax returns...and whats up with all this money your making on the backs of the us taxpayer....among other things
invade mexico and take all their GAS and oil Donald J. Trump
it does no good to tell Nancy.  Time for Americans to storm Washington and remove ALL Democrats by force.   Excersize our 2nd amendment rights.
it's the demo RATS fault at this that these people are not getting paid (but eventually will get paid), dems are stupid and ignorant, we need this wall, walls work, they work in all the other countries that WE actually paid for!  I know these demo RATS got ants in their pants, but they need to let go now and work w/ our president and get this wall up now.  no more pussy footing around here you dems, you need to wise up and see what you dems are doing to this country, you are all (demo RATS) destroying our country by letting illegals thru our border and eating up our money and OUR PEOPLE are the ones that are hurting and suffering, doesn't Pelosi know many of these illegals have killed our people?  what is wrong with her?  OH, yes, she has dementia or much more a mental problem and does not know what she is doing.  what would she do if an illegal killed one of her kids (if she has any) or grandchildren or a loved one?  I guess she would just ignore it, thats her.

my son is a father of 4 in Utah and he gets extremely discouraged at all the Mexicans there - filling their shopping carts with food that he has never been able to buy for his family, crab legs, steak, etc.... Nothing against Mexicans, you understand - just discouraged with our broken system.... I hope this helps shed some light on the reality of things ~
nancy and her dems wont listen cuz they have their own  agenda
nancy. you're a dickhead
narrator: the true devil at work doing what he done for 99.9.9.9 infinities ago never ends
no border then he will lose 2020 to the crazies
no.I did not
ok for you but not others?
one branch of our government can not force another branch! It's at the heart of our democracy! He can not force this construction project funding! no president is all powerful! He can Open the Government and haggle construction funding later! Ya know, so his employees can get out of the food lines, he can stop racking up shutdown costs over 4.6, putting airline travel in jeopardy...
our president is a man of his word. very proud of my president. #MAGA
pelosi and the useful idiot dems put illegals over those workers... its sinful.. stop protecting illegals you freak... and protect those workers and ALL in the USA...DUUUUH

prayers for the angel families if my dad was alive as vet he would have fought for you and trump
preach!!! Waaay to many hand outs... Plus you can't seriously tell me if someone having the job as a governmental employee you're not going to put a decent amount into savings knowing there has been shutdowns with every single presidency.. Or decent planning with said savings.. No way in hell is it paycheck to paycheck.. And if it is that fault is on you and your spending not the government taking your hand outs and ebt... But what to do I know? I'm a trumpeteer üíÅ
present ur case for the wall, dems present their case, america votes, we live with the decision , DONE
push for emergency alert...
really the crisis gets worse.üôÅ
refugees? i call bs. MAYBE and handful as a percentage MIGHT be some form of refugee, but the vast majority crossing the border are no more a refugee than you or i. do things the LEGAL way. as for children being separated from their parents - wake up. obama did that too and i didnt see anyone whining about it. you know what happens to CITIZENS with children that do illegal crap in this country? they lose their children too. don't want to lose your kids? don't do illegal crap. obey the law. it is an insult to people waiting to enter this country legally to be productive citizens to keep allowing these people to flood our border, drain our public resources, over burden our schools, hospitals, and police departments. the ONLY reason the democrats fight so hard to allow illegal immigration to continue is because treasonous sanctuary cities/states ALLOW people that are not citizens to vote in our elections and be named in the us census which determines representation in state/federal government, among other things, and they are too ignorant to realize that they are pawns to the democratic party.
remove nancy now
resign
sad democrats would rather destroy our country rather than have President Trump help U.S.A Citizens.  Amazing the praise muslim hussein received while taking our rights away.  Now we pay two cops 24/7 to block muslim hussein's street at both ends, even though he has built a wall around his house.  Didn't he tell you that?, while he condemns our President, for wanting to protect us.  Anyone that does not want the wall, please remove all locks and fences and walls from YOU house..  Open boarder Open your home.   idiots.
same promise you made to all the children you have in your border prisons???
send your army to subhuman germany destroy my weak and evil enemies and rescue me from the subhuman rebellion.
she  doesn't  care!    I  think  something  is  wrong  with  her!
she has mental health issues
she is part of the kabal, and is there puppet to do their evil work, build the wall Mr President,
sherrie blank, there goes the emotionally unbalanced
shes so cowardly...how insulting to not even see them to acknowledge their pain...never mind the fact shed have to admit theres a problem
shut the border down nothing crosses build the wall
sick
signed Trump! You are getting a second vote for your nonstop love for the American people!
so many lies and so much garbage coming from this FAKE NEWS show! lara loves to spread the BS that comes from dumbass donnie and might go down as an accessory to his crimes!
so screw the 99.5% of all working americans????   those govt employees will get back pay - but how bout all the murdered victims? their families? the drug runners gang members conming across the border?  OPEN YOUR EYES
so why is Pelosi being so self centered,being an ass, hating our country and the people living in our country, hating everyone????  but loves the illegal immigrants and lets them come into our country, using our money for checks, housing, food,medical care, etc.  what is wrong with this jerk?  she really has a problem, she needs to go
socialist, globalist, call them what you will. we need a new joseph mccarthy right now

stay strong Mr. President   you are the only president who is a true patriot
still waiting for you to lock her up
tRump Radio by his daughter in law HaHaHa. Just like in N. Korea.
thank you Mr. President.
thank you for this clip
thanks for info
the Democrats have a big heart filled with compassion; they're simply not understanding the millions it's costing us each day - nor the crime coming with a few that enter...
the art of the deal LOL trump cant get a deal but you think he's a clever cunning man LMAO only morons and idiots read trumps book
the difference between conservatives and liberals, conservatives expect their representatives to keep their promises, while liberals and conservatives do not expect liberal representatives to keep their promises!   Liberals lie, while Americans die!   Thank Your President Trump, stay strong, keep up the fight, keep showing that the traitorcrats really are traitors!
the horror stories of crimes by non-citizens are scary but the scariest of all is the monetary effect of driving down wages and driving up the cost of living.. Fact: even if your parents did not go to college and you did, you can NOT afford the same quality of life as your parents today.  THIS IS WHY
the law of supply and demand.  wages are a price.  scarcity of workers affects the demand (price) / (WAGE)!!!!  this hurts minorities the most.  a lot of people are aware of this.  not only that but every year public sector gives itself raises but private sector is held down by mass immigration.  This is a problem even for Democrats because ultimately, even if you tax the private sector 100% you will not be able to fund the public sector.  As it is, there is talk of removing private property and every other scheme we conquered at the dawn of America and the forces driving these motives are caused by mass migration which drives down wages via the LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND!!!!  we are screwed if we don't fix this and it really is national security.  MEANWHILE the people causing this are doing every thing they can to stop citizens from having children..
the nasty democrats  are going to ruin America
the news media wont report this
the only broken record here is you mr Trump...go back to your reality tv show - let someone who can read lead this nation....lol
the only thing Nancy cares about is money and power she don't care about these Angel Moms or the people in her district
the pornbasterd of a worm and a pig rafael regula, dortmund. raper and hustler and boyfriend of aileen taylor, too
the sisters d√∂√üler, dortmund, germany, too
the socalist/ communist democraps.... are gonna have to build a wall dont worry.... IT IS TO KEEP US IN.....
the wall is a waste of money. there has never been a terror attack by anyone crossing the southern border. and the drugs come hidden in vehicles crossing legal ports of entry, by air and by sea. and the three year dreamer extension just keeps them in limbo. need permanent solution but trump afraid of ann coulter.
the wall isnt pointless its to keep bad people out
their (the Left) struggle with you has gifted you with much positive publicity, use it for God's Good Donald J. Trump! <3
these families need to get more FaceTime. But we know the MSM will try to keep their stories from the public.
they all do
they are
this was going to be a Theresa May style Brexit deal. Hated by both sides. Trump further revealed as the impotent architect of his own continuing failure.- The deal Trump‚Å© offered Sat pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs...nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall
too bad trump didnt budget in for a wall when he budget in for a 1.5 trillion dollar tax cut...I guess trump has his priorities .. then chooses to put the blame on everyone else
too late for our Zionist's occupied government! enemies already in.
trump I want border security.  trump I do NOT WANT A WALL.  Tell your brain to listen to the American people WE DO NOT WANT AN INEFFECTIVE COSTLY WALL
trump has interest in his business to make money off these stocks and business ventures that michael cohnes father in law knows about with ukrain nuclear processes.. and black market.
trump is the one stamping his feet like an infant , he said he would own the shut down , but now as people realise what a mean spirited prick he is he passes the buck to the dems , he cant eve be a MAN and stand by his words , he's a slime ball and you cant see it because he fills you full of hate , it's the only way he can keep your vote . by making you mad for no reason
trump made the system worse - he unilaterally ended DACA & the TPS system.
trump one the best president we ever had we been need some one like him lets stand with him   come peoples he need our help  think adout it

we are a democracy! One branch of our gov't, the executive branch, the president, can't force the other!  End the Shutdown! Fight over "beautiful see through steel barriers"  later!
we dident know he was going to starve us all to death because of a darn wall
we love you
we need a wall
we need our president to do what he promised us in his campaign to build a wall and fix bad immigration laws . we will accept nothing else  , he has caved and offered deals to Dems which aren't solving any illegal immigration law . we have immigration law which spells out the rules file your documents  pay all fees and come into our country legally , central American countries must do the same , they get no passes because they are just south of America's border .that is the right law . trump has faulted making false deals with a crooked congress . what ever happened to the oath these congressional people took ? now we all know what these people of congress only think about --themselves . we not only have to change immigration laws we need changes to their pay scales and term limits to all congress.
we need the wall!
we the people of america don't need a compromise on any illegal immigration what we want is no more illegal immigration agaist our laws . comprimises on illegals who tell us what they will do and invade our border  0---no thanks . how does that rational protect our country ? what we want is for our elected presaident to do his job as his oath says protect our people and country fom invasion of our borders .no more games with congress the law is being broken by invaders their oath also says they woll protect this nation . nobody has honored that oath yet the same thing goes on for years . you people of congress have a duty fo the citizens of americaand nobody else .
we want Pelosi to leave and take her useless democrats with her
we want the wall built.   now
we want the wall we need to help trump keep the usa salf if we dont stand with trump we are no better of the bad peoples lets stand  stong
well  you can use your $3 billion dollars and get the wall your damn self option 2.   you can get all the idiots that voted for you to pay for the wall.if you got $1,000 per person you would  have the wall in no time..
well DIPWAD....you DIDN'T fix it....you have MADE IT WORSE.  How long do you think those border guards are going to work effectively without getting paid.  They will be out there looking for OTHER JOBS sooner than you think if they don't sue you for breach of contract before then.  And how about the coast guard.....they can't sue you, but they damn well can make sure that boat load of cocaine or heroin can just pass them on by.  Why should they put themselves in danger when you refuse to pay them ?????
what  about  the  people  the  blew up  the  buiding  in ok
what a liar...that's all he does...lie, lie lie!  And why are there so many bots on this site?  Oh yeah.....we all know why
when Pelosi became speaker she claimed to have equal power of the President, I believe her but I'm just not seeing it yet...?
when are you going to start the FIXING? You had TWO YEARS
when did he say douchebags in Italy are going to pay? Idiot.
when your ancestors and my ancestors came to American ( unless you are Indian - )
where have you been the last few years? We have one who has done a lot and could do a lot more if the crazies like Nancy and the rest of her comedy crew would quite being so childish. I think it's more about jealousy because of how much more Trump has done over the last President.
who‚Äôs going to pay for it?? mexicooo!!! Do you remember those days. you all got tricked again
why wouldnt they?
with a key that opens the door, inside the door is 6 or so children sleeping in the floor, disgusting abuse
without
wnhen you furlough federal workers like border security officers coast guard officers tsa officials who do security checks on people flying in and out of airports an not pay them weakens our security no one should endure a shut down when there is no reason for it our skies and country are not secure because of your heartless position to punish the very agencies that keep america safe so quit your lying besides you have had 4 bills that were bipartisan and you said no the bill you put forth yesterday was a partisan bill schumer and pelosi were not involved quit pinishing these federal employees for your failures in office these air ports will collapse because of lack of help do to your incompetent actions open up the  government your putting these federal employees in jeopardt of losing there homes being evicted starving unable to pay utilities or rent or to even buy gas for there cars this hs affected federal employees all over the country your number are in the sewer where there suppose to be we the people will remember in 2020 what you and the GOP did to federal wprkers forcing them to work with out pay for a wall most americans say we dont need or want this includes some of your base who are appalled that federal workers who keep us safe are being held hostage if you all refuse to open up the government on tuesday we the people will demand your resignation from office and the resignation of the cowardly GOP also OPEN UP THE GOVERNMENT AND QUIT PLAYING WITH PEOPLES LIVES YOU JERK
wow, theres even a trademarked term now! and you almost have a dozen as your poster children. about 20 veterans commit suicide EACH DAY. thats a real problem. try to build a wall for that you moron
wrong
wtf is an angel family?
yeah..there is lots of them
yes build the wall and send the bill to MEXICO or trumpie supporters you pay the bill. get your tax dollars out.
yes!
you also Pledged that Mexico would pay for the damn wall you POS.  now you hold 800,000 americans , some that are defending our borders  HOSTAGE because Ann Coulter is squeezing your nuts and calls you a punk ... you are a spineless wuss.... 44>45 forever a
you also said you would show your taxes.  Mexico would pay for the wall.  Not enough time to list all 7,538 lies.
you are a failure you need to quit you have bankrupted yourself you're a liar a phony a cheat and there's nothing new to describe how disgraceful you are please leave America go to Russia where they have the best looking prostitutes in the world according to your buddy
you are being pimped by putin page to ignore trump's MASSIVE failures.
you are the one threatening people so what on me loser
you can't keep your promises. You LIE about everything. People don't believe anything you say. The wall will  never be fully funded. Access to the land necessary to build the wall will never be available. You have FAILED. Deal with it.
you did nothing w the money that was already given to you, for border security - you were offered a compromise, money, with stipulation - you were given statistics that your government publishes - you promised that the tax payers would not foot the bill for your precious wall.  it's just all lies.
you go Donald J. Trump President....Secure our borders now....please!
you go president trump built the wall
you guys do realize that our borders are getting less safe everyday the shutdown continues ü§®ü§®
you have already so badly tarnished the American presidency and thrown more people out of work than any company could
you just want to keep the poor on their knees so you feel better about your life. Typical right wing nonsense
you need to SHUT DOWN your social media and go back to NY.
you went to  a democrat function?
your country is broken my friend and I don t think you can fix it
your daughter didn‚Äôt die because the perpetrator was an immigrant. That‚Äôs the red herring.  I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up... If there‚Äôs a concrete wall in front of you, go through it, go over it, go around it, but get to the other side of that wall.‚Äù -Donald Trump Wagner College, 2004
‚ÄúHe is shutting down the government to break his signature campaign promise. His signature campaign promise was that the taxpayers weren‚Äôt going to have to pay for it.‚Äù The House Armed Services Committee Chairman said on ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not a millionaire but I am sponsoring a family Gladly giving up Starbucks eating out etc to help a fellow American and you know what I don‚Äôt give a Damn who they voted for..
‚Ä™Trump has a history not paying workers. Withholding wages to make demands.‚Ä¨  ‚Ä™Now he‚Äôs trying his ransom tactics as President.Taking federal paychecks as hostage. Using Americans as bargaining chips.‚Ä¨  ‚Ä™For or Against a Wall,‚Ä¨ ‚Ä™He is WRONG!‚Ä¨  ‚Ä™No ‚Äúnegotiations‚Äù‚Ä¨ ‚Ä™He must End his shutdown!‚Ä¨
‚ÄúTrump suckered the Democrats into a battle royale over the southern border wall Trump has proposed.  By refraining from declaring a national emergency and then building the wall (with Department of Defense funds saved from the withdrawal from Syria), Trump can simply bypass Congress.  He can order the Army Corps of Engineers to build it.‚Äù
‚ÄòTwas during the shutdown ‚Ä¶.And the speaker of the house,  Tried to leave town ‚Ä¶.quiet as a mouse.  Pelosi was packed ‚Ä¶ She was ready to go.  But Trump sent a letter,‚Äù I don't think so ...‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou can't use my plane,‚Äù he said with Glee, ‚Äú You must stay here and negotiate with me !‚Äù She said ‚ÄúWhat nerve.
